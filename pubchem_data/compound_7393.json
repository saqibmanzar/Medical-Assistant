When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The geometrical mean of eight-hour-time-weighted-average (8 hr-TWA) value for personal ambient PTBP level of the packers was 0.39 mg/cu m (n = 15), higher than that of the carriers (0.10 mg/cu m, n = 5). Amounts of PTBP collected in the respirators used by the workers were in proportion to the 8 hr-TWA values but lower than the estimated theoretical amounts; considerable amounts of PTBP were assumed to be absorbed through the respiratory tract. The urine excreted during the latter half of the shift showed the highest levels of PTBP (geometrical mean: packer, 5.07 micrograms/mL, n = 20; carrier, 3.03 micrograms/mL, n = 8). When the workers were away from the workplace, PTBP levels decreased; most was excreted within 24 hr. Correlation between the urinary PTBP levels and 8 hr-TWA values was significant (r = 0.46, n = 19, P less than 0.05), but its extent was weak. The total amounts of urinary PTBP excreted for 24 hr after the start of the shift were two to three times higher than the estimated respiratory absorption of PTBP; PTBP was assumed to be absorbed not only through the respiratory tract but also through intact skin. It was concluded that the personal ambient PTBP level is not a suitable index for personal exposure, and biological monitoring via the PTBP level in the urine excreted at the end of the each shift is useful for the evaluation of personal exposure.",

Silica-alumina (75% SiO2) which has been sintered at 600 \u00b0C is said to catalyze isomerizations - trans-alkylations. Mixtures of phenol with 2-tert-butylphenol and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol give 4-tert-butylphenol at 165 \u00b0C. In the industrial process, dehydrated strongly acidic sulfonated polystyrene-polydivinylbenzene ion-exchange resins of the macroporous form are employed which are placed on supporting sieves in columntype reactors. For maximum yields two reactors in series, held at different temperatures, must be used. The first reactor, where the exothermic alkylation takes place ( 90 kJ per mole isobutene reacted), is held at 90-100 \u00b0C; the second reactor (isomerization-transalkylation reactor) is held at 120 \u00b0C. ...  The reactants are introduced to the top of the first reactor in a phenol-isobutene molar ratio of 1.4:1. ... The reaction product leaving the isomerizer is worked up by continuous distillation under reduced pressure (4-10 kPa). ... Product yield is  95 % and product purity is > 98 %.",

Possibly hazardous chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA), phenol, p-tert-butylphenol (TBP), and diphenylcarbonate (DPC), are source materials or by-products from PC production. Therefore, a fast and simple analytical method was developed to determine and assess the exposure of BPA, phenol, TBP, and DPC transferred from PC food-contact materials to four different food simulants (water, 4% acetic acid, 50% ethanol, and n-heptane) at different temperatures. The method was validated in terms of limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), recovery, and precision for the detection of BPA, phenol, and TBP using HPLC-FLD and of DPC using HPLC-UV. BPA, phenol, TBP, and DPC concentrations transferred from 200 PC samples to food simulants were determined. The highest migration levels of BPA (54.3 ug/L) and phenol (43.8 ug/L) were found in 50% ethanol at 70 \u00b0C. TBP did not migrate to any simulant. DPC did not show any migration from PC samples into water and only migrated from a cup to 4% acetic acid at 70 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C, whereas migration occurred from several cups, ladles, spoons, and tongs to 50% ethanol and to n-heptane at 25 \u00b0C. Food simulants and temperature were the crucial factors for the migration of BPA and phenol from PC samples. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs), based on food consumption and food-type distribution factors, for BPA, phenol, and DPC were calculated to be 0.007, 0.001, and 2.5X10(-4) ug/kg bw/day, respectively.",

The interiors of these pumps were injection-molded with rubber. We identified a small but significant cluster of vitiligo cases among a group of employees who frequently handled the rubber used in this injection molding process. Although none of the additives specified in the rubber formulations was a phenolic or catecholic derivative, known to be potential causes of chemically induced vitiligo, gas chromatographic analysis identified a para-substituted phenol (2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, DTBP) in solid samples of the most frequently used rubber. Surface wipe analysis confirmed that workers could be exposed to DTBP from simple handling of the rubber. We subsequently established that the solid bulk rubber used as the base in these stock rubber formulations contained both DTBP and smaller quantities of p-tert-butylphenol. Both had formed as unsuspected byproducts during chemical synthesis of two antioxidants added to the solid bulk rubber by a major rubber supplier. We conclude that the unsuspected presence of potential chemical depigmenting agents in solid bulk rubber, from which industrial rubber products are formulated, may contribute to the occurrence of occupational vitiligo, and that a simple review of ingredients in rubber formulations is inadequate to detect their presence.",

If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, assure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

These materials are incompatible with strong reducing substances such as hydrides, nitrides, alkali metals, and sulfides. Flammable gas (H2) is often generated, and the heat of the reaction may ignite the gas. Heat is also generated by the acid-base reaction between phenols and bases. Such heating may initiate polymerization of the organic compound. Phenols are sulfonated very readily (for example, by concentrated sulfuric acid at room temperature). The reactions generate heat. Phenols are also nitrated very rapidly, even by dilute nitric acid.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer safety standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the  effective date of FIFRA '88 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List C, and with List C containing pesticides of greater concern than those on List D. Butylphenol is found on List C. Case No: 3035; Pesticide type: fungicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): butylphenol; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): None; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products.

It is used as a plasticizer for cellulose acetate, intermediate for antioxidants, special starches, oil-soluble phenolic resins, as a pour-point depressors and emulsion breakers for petroleum oils and some plastics, as a synthetic lubricants, industrial odorants, and motor-oil additives. It is no longer used as insecticide. HUMAN STUDIES: In a routine test series of the North American Contact Dermatitis Group in 1,900 patients with contact dermatitis revealed 1.9% positive reactions and the test series with 900-2,000 contact dermatitis patients revealed 1.1% positive reactions to 2% of 4-TBP. Ten shoemakers with eczema due to occupational exposure to 4-TBP containing glues were patch-tested for sensitization. Positive reactions to the glue, its ingredients and 4-TBP were observed in all patients. After 24 hours, reaction in the 4-TBP test was erythema, edema or papules, and some patients showed a few vesicles. After 48 hours, all patients showed these symptoms. In the search for environmental compounds responsible for contact or occupational vitiligo, it was found that the most potent was 4-TBP. In vitro 4-TBP induced oxidative stress that was more readily overcome by melanocytes from normally pigmented individuals than from two individuals with vitiligo. ANIMAL STUDIES: Sluggishness, unsteady gait, prostration, unkempt appearance, and nasal discharge were observed as the principal signs of toxicity in acute studies in rats. After inhalation exposure in rats, clinical signs observed on the day of exposure and up to 7 days after it included mucosal irritation and respiratory distress. Male hamsters given a 15 g/kg in a diet developed hyperplasia in the forestomach and papillomatous lesions. Male rats given a 15 g/kg in a  diet for 51 weeks developed forestomach hyperplasia, but no tumors in the other organs. there were no treatment related toxic effects on pregnant and lactating females or their offspring in developmental studies in rats. 4-TBP did not induce gene mutation in S. Typhimurium TA100, TA98, TA1535, TA1537 and E. coli WP2 uvrA with and without exogenous metabolic activation system. However, 4-TBP induced both structural and numerical chromosome aberrations in vitro.",

Bindi adhesive material was found to contain 80% para-tertiary-butylphenol (PTBP), by thin-layer chromatography, infrared spectrophotometry and high-pressure liquid chromatography. The possibility of hypersensitivity to PTBP was ruled out as none of the 15 patients tested with 2% PTBP and 1% para-tertiary-butylphenol-formaldehyde resin gave any positive reactions. Development of depigmentation could have been due either to individual susceptibility or to constant use for a prolonged period. The area of contact being very small, generalized vitiligo as a result of systemic absorption appeared to be a remote possibility.",

This symptom occurred especially at the skin of exposed body sites like hands and forearms and consisted of more or less intensively spread finger-nail to palm-sized depigmented spots with irregular configuration. Visible mucous membranes, hair and nails were without any findings. No irritation occurred prior to or during the development of vitiligo. An enlarged liver and spleen was observed in 4 and 1 of these vitiligo patients, respectively. Some liver enzyme activities were increased in two cases, of which one case showed increase in the BSP clearance. In thyroid gland, one patient showed microsomal autoantibodies (titer: 1 : 25600) and thyreoglobuline-auto-antibodies (titer: 1 : 25), and another showed struma diffusa of grade 1 (WHO classification).

Acute peroral LD50 values (95% confidence limits) of 5.4 (3.6-7.9) g/kg and 3.6 (3.0-4.4) g/kg were obtained for male and female albino rats, respectively. Occluded cutaneous applications of moistened PTBP at 16 g/kg for 24 hr produced no mortalities in male or female rabbits, but signs of local toxicity and irritation were apparent at the site of application. A 6 hr exposure to a substantially saturated vapor under static conditions produced no mortality, while a 4 hr exposure to a dynamically generated respirable dust aerosol at a concentration of 5.6 mg/L produced 20% mortality. Occluded dermal contact (4 hr) with 0.5 g moistened PTBP produced a range of effects from no reaction to necrosis. PTBP placed in the conjunctival sac of rabbits produced severe ocular injury which generally persisted for 21 days after exposure. The major hazard associated with acute exposure to PTBP appears to be the irritation produced by dermal or ocular contact.",

Aminopyrine demethylase activity was inhibited by the administration of NCO-650 and BP at a dose of 2 and 10 mg/kg, p.o. The increases of microsomal cytochrome b5 and cytochrome P-450 contents were noticed at 1, 12 and 24 hr after NCO-650 and BP administration. Ascorbate-dependent lipid peroxidation of mitochondria and microsome increased by the administration of NCO-650 and BP, but NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation decreased by these drugs. In the morphological observations of fine structure in the liver, NCO-650 and BP caused the swelling and decrease of rough endoplasmic reticulum and the increase of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The morphological changes of liver fine structure were related to the changes of drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver by the administration of NCO-650 and BP, which may be suggest the transitory and functional responses of these drugs in the liver. The effect of BP on the drug-metabolizing enzymes and fine structure in the liver was similar to that of NCO-650.",

Multiple factors contribute to cell death, including genetically determined susceptibility to trauma, and environmental factors, such as exposure to 4-tert-butylphenol (4-TBP). We demonstrate that 4-TBP induces oxidative stress that is more readily overcome by melanocytes from normally pigmented individuals than from two individuals with vitiligo. The antioxidant catalase selectively and significantly reduced death of melanocytes derived from two individuals with vitiligo, indicating a role for oxidative stress in vitiligo pathogenesis. In normal melanocytes, oxidative stress results in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Melanocyte-stimulating hormone-induced expression of MITF protein caused increased sensitivity to 4-TBP, whereas sensitivity of melanomas correlated with MITF expression. MITF stimulates melanin synthesis by up-regulating expression of melanogenic enzymes such as tyrosinase-related protein-1 (Tyrp1). Although melanin content per se did not affect sensitivity to 4-TBP, expression of Tyrp1 significantly increased sensitivity. Melanocytes and melanomas that express functional Tyrp1 were significantly more sensitive to 4-TBP than Tyrp1-null cells. Thus, normal melanocytes respond to 4-TBP by reducing expression of MITF and Tyrp1. We hypothesize that melanocytes in vitiligo demonstrate reduced ability to withstand oxidative stress due, partly, to a disruption in MITF regulation of Tyrp1.",

Small percentages of unreacted p-tert-butylphenol occur in polycarbonates and epoxy resins, and p-tert-butylphenol has been detected in landfill leachates and incinerator emissions. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.00919 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p-tert-butylphenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase p-tert-butylphenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.5 hours. p-tert-Butylphenol absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, p-tert-butylphenol is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1290. The pKa of p-tert-butylphenol is 10.16, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the neutral form in the environment. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.19X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. p-tert-Butylphenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Results of biodegradation screen tests suggest p-tert-butylphenol can be readily biodegradable via adapted microorganisms and at concentrations below inhibitory effects. Therefore, biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process in both soil and water. If released into water, p-tert-butylphenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 38 and 279 days, respectively. An BCF range of 20-120 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. p-tert-Butylphenol is stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, pH 7 and pH 9. Occupational exposure to p-tert-butylphenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-tert-butylphenol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to p-tert-butylphenol via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with consumer products containing p-tert-butylphenol. Potential consumer exposure is via use of products with phenolic resins or epoxy resins containing residual p-tert-butylphenol. Consumers may be exposed to p-tert-butylphenol in drinking water from drinking water reservoirs coated with epoxy-based paints or from pipelines. Consumers may also be exposed to p-tert-butylphenol from polycarbonate used for food contact material. (SRC)",

Volatilization of p-tert-butylphenol from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.19X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). p-tert-Butylphenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.00919 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5).

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 38 and 279 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), a measured BCF range of 20-120(6,7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate(SRC). Results of biodegradation screen tests suggest p-tert-butylphenol can be readily biodegradable via adapted microorganisms and at concentrations below inhibitory effects(8). Therefore, biodegradation is expected to be an important fate process(SRC). p-tert-Butylphenol was found to be stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, pH 7 and pH 9 using OECD Guideline 111(9).",

In a DOC-Die Away Test (OECD Guideline 301A) using unadapted activated sludge, p-tert-butylphenol (13 mg/L) was degraded 98% during a 28-day incubation period with a 10-day window criterion fulfilled classifying the compound as readily biodegradable(2,3); however, it can not be excluded that the inoculum might have been adapted to p-tert-butylphenol, as it was taken from a heavily industrialized area treatment plant(2). Using OECD Guideline 301B (CO2 Evolution Test) with an activated sludge inoculum, p-tert-butylphenol achieved final mean degradation of 58.5 and 63.6% (at 5 and 10 mg/L respectively), but did not pass the ready biodegradability criterion (60% degradation within a 10-days window, counting from the time the biodegradation passes the 10% level)(2). Using a Manometric Respiratory test system (OECD Guideline 301F) and an in-house unadapted activated sludge, p-tert-butylphenol achieved 28-day theoretical BODs of 60% (15 mg/L) and 42% (25 mg/L) with lag-phases of 12-16 days before initial degradation begins(2); the criterion of ready biodegradability was not met(2); the results of this study indicates that municipal sludge microorganisms require an adaptation period in order to degrade p-tert-butylphenol rapidly(2). When activated sludge from a municipal sewage treatment plant was used as the inoculum, <0.1% of initial p-tert-butylphenol (50 ug/L) was degraded to CO2 within 5 days(4).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9.5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the estimated OH radical reaction of p-tert-butylphenol with hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solutions at pH 9 is 1.9X10+10 L/mol-sec(2); this corresponds to an aquatic half-life of 42 days at an aquatic concentration of 1X10-17 hydroxyl radicals per liter(3). p-tert-Butylphenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Using OECD Guideline 111, p-tert-butylphenol was found to be stable to hydrolysis at pH 4, pH 7 and pH 9(5). p-tert-Butylphenol absorbs in the UV region at wavelengths >290 nm(5,6) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). In a photodegradation test where p-tert-butylphenol was adsorbed to silica gel and irradiated with light >290nm, 46.8% was degraded(7). Direct photolysis of  p-tert-butylphenol was found to yield 4-tert-butylcatechol and 4-tert-butylphenol dimer(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Compared with the field fish, endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) concentrations in market fish bile were at relatively high levels with high detectable rates. The average concentrations of BPA, nonylphenol, 4-tert-octylphenol, 4-tert-butylphenol, and norethindrone in field fish bile were 30.1 ug/L, 203 ug/L, 4.69 ug/L, 7.84 ug/L, and 0.514 ug/L, respectively; in market fish bile they were 240 ug/L, 528 ug/L, 76.5 ug/L, 12.8 ug/L, and 5.26 ug/L, respectively; and in the surface water of Xin'an River they were 38.8 ng/L, 7.91 ng/L, 1.98 ng/L, 2.66 ng/L, and 0.116 ng/L, respectively. The average of total estrogenic activity of river water was 3.32 ng/L estradiol equivalents. High bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were discovered for all 5 EDCs (998-fold) in field fish bile. Furthermore, the authors analyzed the BCF value of BPA in fish bile after 30-days exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA in the laboratory, and the analysis revealed that BCF in fish bile (BCFFish bile) changed in an inverse concentration-dependent manner based on the log10-transformed BPA concentration in water. Strikingly, the data from the field study were well fitted within this trend. The data together suggested that analysis of fish bile extracts could be an efficient method for assessing waterborne EDCs exposure for aquatic biota.",

Occupational exposure to p-tert-butylphenol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-tert-butylphenol is produced or used(2). Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to p-tert-butylphenol via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with consumer products containing p-tert-butylphenol(SRC). Potential consumer exposure is via use of products with phenolic resins or epoxy resins containing residual p-tert-butylphenol(2). Consumers may be exposed to p-tert-butylphenol in drinking water from drinking water reservoirs coated with epoxy-based paints or from pipelines(2). Consumers may also be exposed to p-tert-butylphenol from polycarbonate used for food contact material(2). p-tert-Butylphenol was identified as a compound that could potentially leach from plastic pipes and contaminate drinking water(3).",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The lethal concn of diquat in hydrilla tissue was about 600 ug/g dry weight.  Dissolved oxygen concns decreased until day 4 or 5, leveled off, & then rose after day 7.  Expressed as a % of the control dissolved oxygen concn, treatment concns leveled off at about  80%, 40%, & 30% in the 0.2, 0.5, & 0.75-1.0 ug/ml treatments, respectively. Membrane  permeability, expressed as incr in conductivity of deionized water over a 4 hr interval/gram  (dry weight) of hydrilla tissue increased until day 4, plateaued until day 9, then declined.  Chlorophyll A concns showed no statistically significant differences.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Diquat  cytotoxicity was  intensified in hepatocytes of old rats compared with those of mature   rats,  and the enhanced  toxicity was associated with increased lipid peroxidation and  protein   carbonyl formation.  However, the enhanced toxicity in old rat hepatocytes was also   accompanied  by a decr in  diquat-induced GSH oxidation and there was no difference in protein   sulfhydryl  loss. Concentrations  of total nonheme iron and low-molecular-weight chelatable Fe2+,   measured with  ferene as the  chromogen, were several times higher in freshly isolated   hepatocytes of old rats  than in  those of mature rats. ...",

Application of diquat on day 4  yielded an estimated  LC50 of 19.5 g/L through  18 days of incubation, and 9.6 g/L through  hatching. Body and organ  weights, and bone  lengths of hatchlings did not differ between control and treatment groups  with the exception  of a slight incr in brain weight in the 14  g/L group. Malformations in  diquat-treated  embryos included defects of the brain, eye, bill,  limb, and pelvis; skeletal  scoliosis; and  incomplete ossification. Subcutaneous edema was also  present. Significant  manifestations of  oxidative stress were apparent in hatchlings and  included increased hepatic  thiobarbituric  acid-reactive substances (TBARS) (lipid peroxidation) and decreased brain reduced  glutathione (GSH). Brain protein-bound sulfhydryls (PBSH) increased. Diquat applied  on day  21 of incubation yielded an estimated LC50 of 12.6 g/L through hatching. Exposure at  this  late stage of development did not produce deformities. Body and organ weights and, bone   lengths of hatchlings did not differ between control and treatment groups. Significant   manifestations of oxidative stress in hatchlings included decreased brain GSH, increased   oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and ratio of GSSG to GSH. This study suggests that concns of   diquat commonly used for aquatic weed control, when based upon the dilution  effect of avg   water depth of the application area, would probably have little impact on  mallard embryos. However, concns applied above ground to weeds and cattails along  ditches could adversely   affect the survival and development of mallard embryos, and presumably  other avian species   nesting in such habitats.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of <<1.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diquat dibromide will exist in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase diquat dibromide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Diquat has an absorption maximum at 310 nm and is therefore susceptible to UV decomposition. However, when adsorbed on particulate matter, no photodegradation occurs. If released to soil, diquat dibromide is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Diquat dibromide is a divalent cation and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process as diquat dibromide reached 0% of its theoretical BOD using the Japanese MITI test. If released into water, diquat dibromide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Diquat dibromide will exist almost entirely in the ionized form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. A BCF range of 0.6 to 1.4 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Diquat dibromide is stable in neutral or acid solutions; however, it hydrolyzes in alkaline waters. Occupational exposure to diquat dibromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diquat dibromide is produced or used. Monitoring data were not located that would indicate general population exposure to diquat dibromide; however, drift from aerial application in the immediate vicinity is a possibility. (SRC)",

After 65 days, only 0.88 and 0.21% of the diquat dromide was converted to CO2 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions using water and sediment from a eutrophic lake and negligible using water and sediment from an oligotrophic lake(3). Diquat dibromide adsorbed on the internal faces of montmorillonite clay in aqueous soil-nutrient solution was not degraded by microorganisms over a one year period(4). When adsorbed in the interlayer spacings of the clay, the compound probably persists indefinitely in its original form, although in a biologically inactive state(4).",

Therefore, diquat dibromide would dissipate rapidly from chlorinated drinking water which was slightly alkaline(2). Solutions of diquat dibromide are readily reduced, taking on an intense green color due to the formation of a water-soluble, relatively stable, free radical(4). Reduction is autooxidizable and the green color disappears on shaking the solution in air(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

They are highly soluble and behave as strong electrolytes even under acid conditions. Thus, their hydrophobic-hydrophilic interaction and dissociation constants do not affect their adsorption characteristics(1).

There is also evidence that charge-transfer complexes are formed between the humic acid and the bipyridylium cation(1). The relative importance of the two mechanisms is a matter of speculation(1). Diquat dibromide was in the lowest of 5 mobility categories in soil mobility measurements on 14 montmorillonite and non-montmorillonite soils(2,4). Its mobility was not correlated with any soil properties except for clay content in the case of montmorillonite soils(2). X-ray studies reveal that the diquat dibromide is tightly adsorbed to the interlayer spacings of montmorillonite making it unavailable to microorganisms(3). Adsorption by kalolinite and vermiculite is less strong and the availability of the diquat dibromide wasn't reduced completely(3). Diquat dibromide is completely adsorbed by bentonite at pH 4.1 and 8.2 and strongly adsorbed by muck at pH 3.2 and 5.3(5).",

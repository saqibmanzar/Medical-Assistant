PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

MAC isolates resistant to azithromycin also are resistant to clarithromycin and complete cross-resistance occurs between these anti-infectives for this organism. Cross-resistance in these isolates appears to be the result of a single point mutation at the position that is homologous to the Escherichia coli positions 2058 or 2059 on the 23S rRNA gene.10 MAC isolates exhibiting cross-resistance generally have an increase in azithromycin MICs to 128 ug/mL or greater or clarithromycin MICs to 32 ug/mL or greater (determined using a radiometric broth dilution susceptibility test with Middlebrook 7H12 medium).  Although the clinical importance of cross-resistance between azithromycin and clarithromycin is not fully understood, preclinical data suggest that reduced activity to both drugs will occur after MAC isolates produce the 23S rRNA mutation.",

A mutation in Treponema pallidum that confers resistance to macrolides (including azithromycin) has been identified. T. pallidum containing this mutation has been isolated from several syphilis patients in San Francisco who failed to respond to azithromycin treatment. The overall prevalence of this mutation in T. pallidum has not been determined, but it has been found in specimens obtained in the US (Baltimore, San Francisco, Seattle) and Ireland (Dublin).",

Up to 10 metabolites of azithromycin have been identified, and all are microbiologically inactive. While short-term administration of azithromycin produces hepatic accumulation of the drug and increases azithromycin demethylase activity, current evidence indicates that hepatic cytochrome p450 induction of inactivation via cytochrome-metabolite complex formation does not occur. In contrast to erythromycin, azithromycin does not inhibit its own metabolism via this pathway.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Bactericidal activity has been observed in vitro against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Azithromycin inhibits protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by penetrating the cell wall and binding to 50S ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. The site of action of azithromycin appears to be the same as that of the macrolides (i.e., erythromycin, clarithromycin), clindamycin, lincomycin, and chloramphenicol. The antimicrobial activity of azithromycin is reduced at low pH. Azithromycin concentrates in phagocytes, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and fibroblasts. Penetration of the drug into phagocytic cells is necessary for activity against intracellular pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella typhi).",

Employees who are sensitive to natural rubber (latex) should use nitrile or other synthetic nonlatex gloves. Use of powdered latex gloves should be avoided due to the risk of latex allergy. Eye Protection: Safety glasses with sideshields are recommended. Face shields or goggles may be required if splash potential exists or if corrosive materials are present. Approved eye protection (e.g., bearing the ANSI Z87 or CSA stamp) is preferred. Maintain eyewash facilities in the work area. Protective clothing: For handling of laboratory scale quantities, a cloth lab coat is recommended.

Unconfirmed epidemiologic evidence indicates that the risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis might be increased by maternal use of macrolide antibiotics during the first two weeks of breastfeeding, but others have questioned this relationship. In one study, a single dose of azithromycin given during labor to women who were nasal carriers of pathogenic Staphylococcus and Streptococcus reduced the counts of these bacteria in breastmilk, but increased the prevalence of azithromycin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae in breastmilk.",

One hour after the intake of 500 mg azithromycin the patient developed weakness of the legs and respiratory distress due to respiratory muscle failure. She was hospitalized in a comatose state and required intubation and mechanical ventilation for six days. Acute worsening of myasthenia gravis was observed in this patient in 1986 after parenteral administration of erythromycin. Erythromycin causing aggravation of myasthenia gravis by interfering with neuromuscular transmission is reported in the literature. The close temporal relationship between the intake of azithromycin and severe worsening of myasthenia gravis in our patient suggests that azithromycin, a new azalid-antibiotic of the macrolid group, can exacerbate myasthenia gravis. /The investigators/ conclude that azithromycin should be added to the list of drugs to be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis.",

Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a hypersensitivity disorder that may also be caused by medications. We present a case of a 62-year-old male patient who developed vanishing bile duct syndrome a month after Stevens-Johnson syndrome. These adverse drug reactions were associated with the use of azithromycin (500 mg daily for 3 days). The patient was initially treated for Stevens-Johnson syndrome with steroids, antihistamines and proton pump inhibitors and fully recovered. However, a month after the beginning of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, he developed vanishing bile duct syndrome and was treated with steroids, ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines and tacrolimus. Unfortunately, the treatment was unsuccessful and he was listed for liver transplantation which was performed 7 months after the beginning of jaundice. ...",

Reproduction and fertility studies were performed in the Long-Evans rat at oral doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg/day. Males were treated for nine weeks prior to and during mating, and females for two weeks prior to mating and throughout mating, gestation and lactation. Half of the females were sacrificed and evaluated on day 14 of gestation, and the remaining females were killed on day 21 post-partum. Postnatal development testing on F1 pups was performed during lactation. F1 pups were raised to maturity and mated to produce an F2 generation, and all animals were sacrificed at weaning. Pregnancy rate was decreased at the 20 mg/kg/day level but no other azithromycin related effects were detected upon reproductive parameters in F0 dams or in the F1 or F2 generation. Two additional fertility studies suggested that azithromycin may cause a minimal reduction in fertility at 20 and 30 mg/kg compared to controls and that both male and female rats must be simultaneously treated to affect pregnancy rate. These pregnancy rates were, however, still within the range of our historical control data. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity of azithromycin were evaluated in female Sprague-Dawley rats at oral doses of 10, 20, 40, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day administered from days 6 to 15 post-insemination. A slight delay in ossification was noted in fetuses at the 200 mg/kg dose level and was related to evidence of maternal toxicity. Azithromycin was not teratogenic at any dose level. Similar studies in albino mice at the same dose level did not produce embryotoxic, fetotoxic, or teratogenic effects, and fetal tissue concentrations were higher than in maternal plasma or amniotic fluid. Azithromycin was tested in Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate peri-natal effects on dams and on postnatal development of their pups. Dose levels were 10, 20, 40, 50, 100 or 200 mg/kg/day administered from day 15 post-insemination through day 20 post-partum. Effects noted at doses of 50 mg/kg and higher included decreased pup body weight, decreased pup viability and delayed development which correlated with greater litter size. There were no malformations or severe lesions in any of the pups.",

In the Ames Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100, the presence of azithromycin was not associated with any increase in the number of his- revertants. Urine from mice dosed with up to 200 mg/kg of azithromycin also had no effect on the number of revertants in these same strains suggesting the absence of mutagenic excretory products following oral exposure. When tested up to the cytotoxic level of 240 ug/ml, azithromycin caused no increase in the mutant frequency at the thymidine kinase locus of L5178Y/TK cells. Both the mammalian and microbial gene mutation assays included the presence of rat-liver postmitochondrial (S9) fraction for the detection of mutagenic biotransformation products. Mitogen-stimulated human lymphocytes cultured in the presence of 2.5-7.5 micrograms/ml azithromycin for 24 hr or 30.0-40.0 micrograms/ml azithromycin for 3 hr in the presence of rat S9 had chromosomal aberration frequencies that were no different than negative control cells even though slight to moderate mitotic suppression was associated with these concentrations. In vivo assessment of this compound was completed in male and female mice with a single oral dose of 200 mg/kg followed by sacrifice at 6, 24 or 48 hr later and metaphase analysis of bone marrow for chromosomal aberrations. No statistically significant elevations of chromosomally aberrant cells were found. We conclude that azithromycin does not cause gene mutations in microbial or mammalian cells, or chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes or in mouse bone marrow in vivo.",

Such phospholipid accumulation has been demonstrated in numerous organ systems (e.g., eye, dorsal root ganglia, liver, gallbladder, kidney, spleen, pancreas) in dogs at azithromycin doses approximately equivalent to twice the recommended adult human dose (on a mg/kg basis) and in rats at doses comparable to the recommended adult human dose. Phospholipidosis also has been observed in the tissues of neonatal rats and dogs given azithromycin daily for 10-30 days; the extent of phospholipidosis observed in these neonates was similar to that observed in adult animals. In neonatal rats or dogs given 30 or 10 mg/kg, respectively, of azithromycin, phospholipidosis was observed at a peak plasma azithromycin concentration of 1.3 ug/mL (6 times greater than the peak plasma concentration of 0.216 mcg/mL observed in children receiving azithromycin 10 mg/kg) or 1.5 ug/mL (7 times greater than the peak plasma concentration observed in children receiving azithromycin 10 mg/kg), respectively. On a mg/sq m basis, azithromycin 30 mg/kg in the rat (135 mg/sq m) or 10 mg/kg in the dog (79 mg/sq m) are approximately 0.4 or 0.6 times, respectively, the recommended pediatric dose for a child who weighs 25 kg.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates azithromycin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase azithromycin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, azithromycin is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3100. The pKa of azithromycin is 8.74, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an cation and cations do not volatilize. Azithromycin may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon the estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil and water were not available. If released into water, azithromycin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa indicates azithromycin will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 200 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Azithromycin photodegradation followed first-order reaction kinetics in environmental waters under simulated solar radiation; in artificial freshwater (pH 6.8) the half-life was 7 hours. Occupational exposure to azithromycin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where azithromycin is produced or administered. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to azithromycin via dermal contact with water. Exposure to azithromycin among the general population will also occur among those administered the drug, an antibiotic. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 200(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Azithromycin photodegradation followed first-order reaction kinetics in environmental waters under simulated solar radiation; in artificial freshwater (pH 6.8) the half-life was 7 hours(5). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2012).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

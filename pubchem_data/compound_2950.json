PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Following intravenous administration, about 80% of the dantron conjugates in bile were excreted after 1 hr; the dose fractions found after 5 hr represented about 20%, 30% and 40% of the low-; intermediate- and high-dose levels, respectively. The corresponding fractions in urine were 16%, 12% and 10%, giving rise to bile:urine excretion ratios of 1.3, 2.7 and 4.0, respectively. Only 30-50% of the dose could be accounted for by conjugates.

These included danthron monosulfate (II) and -glucuronide (III), two other phase 2 metabolites which behaved as the corresponding diconjugates, and several phase 1 metabolites (IV) in conjugated form. ... Following infusion, about 80% of the danthron conjugates in bile were excreted after 1 hour; the dose fractions found after 5 hours represented about 20%, 30%, and 40% at the low, intermediate and high dose level, respectively. The corresponding fractions in urine were 16%, 12% and 10%, giving rise to bile:urine excretion ratios of 1.3, 2.7 and 4.0, respectively. This change in excretion pattern was associated with changes in metabolite muster, which involved a decrease in the balance of IV:I conjugates, as well as an increase in III:II ratio. IV was more abundantly present in bile than in urine, and showed a more sustained excretion than the danthron conjugates. By intragastric administration, the cumulated excretion (bile + urine) of I conjugates were only 6%, 8% and 5% of dose, in three consecutive 6 hours' periods (0-6, 6-12 and 12-18 hours after dosing).

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Danthron caused DNA damage particularly at guanines in the 5'-GG-3', 5'-GGGG-3', 5'-GGGGG-3' sequences (damaged bases are underlined) in the presence of Cu(II), cytochrome P450 reductase and the NADPH-generating system. The DNA damage was inhibited by catalase and bathocuproine, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 and Cu(I). The formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine increased with increasing concentration of danthron. On the other hand, carcinogenic anthraquinone induced less oxidative DNA damage than danthron. Electron spin resonance study showed that the semiquinone radical could be produced by P450 reductase plus NADPH-mediated reduction of danthron, while little signal was observed with anthraquinone. These results suggest that danthron is much more likely to be reduced by P450 reductase and generate reactive oxygen species through the redox cycle, leading to more extensive Cu(II)-mediated DNA damage than anthraquinone. In the case of anthraquinone, its hydroxylated metabolites with similar reactivity to danthron may participate in DNA damage in vivo. /It was concluded/ that oxidative DNA damage by danthron and anthraquinone seems to be relevant for the expression of their carcinogenicity.",

All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine. In a cell-free decatenation assay, emodin exerted a stronger, danthron a similar and aloe-emodin a weaker inhibition of topoisomerase II activity than m-amsacrine. Analysis of the chromosomal extent of DNA damage induced by these anthraquinones was performed in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells. Anthraquinone-induced mutant cell clones showed similar chromosomal lesions when compared to the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and m-amsacrine, but were different from mutants induced by the DNA alkylator ethyl methanesulfonate. These data support the idea that inhibition of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II contributes to anthraquinone-induced genotoxicity and mutagenicity.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

In the absence of an approved application, products containing these drugs for laxative use also would be misbranded under section 502 of the act (21 U.S.C. 352). The final rule amends part 310 (21 CFR part 310) to include danthron by adding new Sec. 310.545(a)(12)(iv)(B). Because a safety problem has been identified for OTC drug products containing danthron, this final rule is effective on the date of its publication in the Federal Register. Therefore, on or after January 29, 1999, no OTC drug products that are subject to this final rule may be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless they are the subject of an approved application.",

Starting at 6 weeks of age, mice were divided into four groups, two of which were treated with sc injections of DMH (20 mg/kg body wt) once a week for 12 weeks. A week after the final injection of DMH, one group was kept on the basal diet throughout the study (group I), and the other group was fed the diet containing chrysazin (mixed in basal diet at 0.2% concentration) alone for 42 weeks (group II). The other two groups were injected with normal saline and given the diet containing 0.2% chrysazin for 42 weeks (group III), or the basal diet during the experiment (group IV). The incidence and multiplicity of colon tumors of group II were significantly greater than those of group I (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). The incidence and multiplicity of the hepatocellular neoplasms of group II were larger than those of group I (P < 0.002, P < 0.02 respectively). In group III, colon tumors were not found, though a few liver neoplasms and severe inflammatory lesions of the colon were observed. The activity of ornithine decarboxylase of the colonic mucosa in mice exposed to chrysazin was stronger than that of animals without chrysazin. The results suggest that the promoting effect of chrysazin is probably related to an increase of cell proliferation in the target organ. A synergistic effect of DMH with chrysazin was also observed in liver tumorigenesis.",

The animals in groups one, two and three were respectively given diets supplemented with 0%, 0.1% and 0.2% DHAQ for 24 days. PGE2 levels in the colorectal mucosa were significantly (P < 0.05 and 0.001) elevated after DHAQ treatment and showed some evidence of a dependence of DHAQ dose, consistent with the plasma PGE2 levels. BrdU-labeling indices in the large intestinal epithelium were also significantly (P < 0.01) increased, although the other portions of the gut such as the stomach and small intestine were not significantly affected. Excretion of the main urinary metabolite of PGE (PGE-MUM) was significantly (P < 0.001 or 0.01) increased whereas the urinary PGE2 concentration and total PGE2 excretion were not changed. Thus the results of the ... study clearly indicate enhancement of cell proliferation by DHAQ in the large intestine epithelia, correlated with increased PGE2 levels in the large intestinal mucosa as well as the plasma, and possible support for the conclusion that quantitative analysis of urinary PGE-MUM, but not PGE2 itself, offer a useful approach for biomonitoring exposure to such stimulant laxatives.",

Male F344 rats were fed a diet containing danthron, sennosid A, bisacodyl, 1-hydroxyanthraquinone (1-HAQ), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), pectin, carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) or sodium chloride (NaCl) for 7 days. The stimulant laxatives, danthron, sennosid A and bisacodyl, significantly induced cell proliferation in almost the entire intestinal epithelia in a clear dose-dependent manner. DSS also induced cell proliferation in some portions at high doses. Increase in BrdU-labelling indices was correlated well with the severity of inflammatory changes in the intestinal mucosa as well as with purging effects of stimulant laxatives and DSS. In contrast, the bulk-forming laxative CMC-Na did not consistently enhance cell proliferation nor cause apparent cytotoxicity in the intestine despite exerting remarkable purging effects. 1-HAQ and MgSO4 slightly induced cell proliferation in the cecum and the colorectum, although there was little or no intestinal cytotoxicity. Pectin and NaCl did not influence cell kinetics of the epithelia, nor cause any inflammatory changes in the mucosa. /These/ results thus indicate that diarrhea caused by laxatives is not necessarily correlated with induction of cell proliferation, as in the intestinal mucosa, and that inflammatory changes followed by regenerative process could be responsible for enhancing cell kinetics...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.6X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1,8-Dihydroxyanthraquinone absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8,600. An estimated pKa value of 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone is 8.45, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 50 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone is produced or used. The general population should no longer be exposed to 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone via its use as a cathartics agent as its use was discontinued in Canadian, US and UK markets in 1998. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 15 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 1,8-Dihydroxyanthraquinone is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). 1,8-Dihydroxyanthraquinone absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm(3,4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The uptake, exhalation and metabolism of ethylene can be described by first-order kinetics. Uptake of ethylene into the body is low. Clearance due to uptake, which reflects the transfer rate of ethylene from the atmosphere into the body, was 25 L/hr for a man of 70 kg. This value represents only 5.6% of the experimentally obtained alveolar ventilation rate of 150 L/hr. The majority (94.4%) of ethylene inhaled into the lungs is exhaled again without becoming systemically available via the blood stream. Maximal accumulation of ethylene in the same man, determined as the thermodynamic partition coefficient whole body:air was 0.53. The concentration ratio at steady state was even smaller (0.33), owing to metabolic elimination. Clearance due to metabolism, in relation to the concentration in the atmosphere, was calculated to be 9.3 L/hr for a man of 70 kg. This indicates that at steady state about 36% of systemically available ethylene is eliminated metabolically and 64% is eliminated by exhalation as the unchanged substance, as can be calculated from the values of clearance of uptake and of clearance of metabolism. The biological half-life of ethylene was 0.65 hr. The alveolar retention of ethylene at steady state was calculated to be 2%. From theoretical considerations of the lung uptake of gases and vapors, it can be deduced that the low uptake rate of ethylene is due to its low solubility in blood: Ostwald's solubility coefficient for human blood at 37 \u00b0C, 0.15.",

Blood and organs from two mice were pooled 4 hr after the end of exposure. Radioactivity was about the same in kidney (0.16 uCi/g wet weight) and liver (0.14 uCi/g) but lower in testis (0.035 uCi/g), brain (0.02 uCi/g) and Hb (0.0094 uCi/g Hb).

The radioactivity in Hb was 0.011 uCi/g Hb.

Ethane is the primary feedstock in the USA, followed by propane, naphthas, gas oils and butane. Small amounts of ethylene are recovered from other feedstocks, such as retrograde-field condensates and refinery waste gases. Dehydration of ethanol is the third commercial route to ethylene.",

Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. CAUTION: When LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972) is released on or near water, product may vaporize explosively. (ERG, 2024)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Ethylene in the presence of aluminum chloride may undergo a violent reaction, [J. Inst. Pet. 33:254(1947]. Ozone and ethylene react explosively, [Berichte 38:3837]. Contact of very cold liquefied gas with water may result in vigorous or violent boiling of the product and extremely rapid vaporization due to the large temperature differences involved. If the water is hot, there is the possibility that a liquid \"superheat\" explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if liquid gas contacts water in a closed container, [Handling Chemicals Safely 1980]. Ethylene can polymerize at low pressure if catalyzed by titanium halides.

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise.  Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated.

As many people were concerned about their individual body burden, biomonitoring was recommended for all people involved. 816 persons took advantage of this opportunity and came for blood sampling to the occupational health department of our company ...",

It is used for oxyethylene welding and cutting metals, as well as in the manufacture of alcohol, mustard gas, and many other organics. It is also used in manufacture of ethylene oxide (for plastics), polythene, polystyrene and other plastics. Ethylene is a plant growth regulator, which is used commercially to accelerate the ripening of various fruits. HUMAN STUDIES: Exposure to 37.5% ethylene for 15 min may result in marked memory disturbances. Humans exposed to as much as 50% ethylene in air, whereby the oxygen availability is decreased to 10%, experienced a loss of consciousness. Prolonged inhalation of 85% ethene in air is slightly toxic, whereas 94% in oxygen is fatal. Death is certain at 8% oxygen. In fatal human intoxication, ethylene affects the respiratory center of the brain and kills by suffocation. Postmortem analysis has revealed that the right side of the heart is full of blood, while the left side is empty. In workers chronically exposed, ethylene has been associated with a decrease in maximum arterial pressure, slower pulse, lengthened later period of the visual-motor response, increased thresholds of olfaction and hearing, and tension of the thermoregulatory apparatus. In eight people not occupationally exposed to ethylene, the DNA adduct 7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine was detected at a background level in peripheral lymphocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Mice were dosed by gavage with 3.75 mg/kg bw ethylene for 4 months. The treated animals displayed no changes in behavior or in body weight gain and oxygen consumption. Gross pathology examination revealed no changes in the relative weights or in the histological structure of the visceral organs. Inhalation exposure to 600,000 ppm continuously for 90 days in rats caused reduced food uptake and activity, peripheral leucopenia, decreased thrombocyte and erythrocyte count, and decrease in bone marrow cellularity. One-day-old and adult rats continuously exposed to 3 mg/cu m per day for 90 days exhibited hypertension, disruption of the subordination chronaxy, and decreased cholinesterase activity. Experiments proved ethylene to be metabolized in certain species, notably mice and rats, into the carcinogenic and mutagenic ethylene oxide. Administration of ethylene by head-only exposure revealed no potential for adverse reproductive effects in the rat. Ethylene was not found to be mutagenic with or without metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA1537, TA100, or TA1535. Rats and mice exposed 6 hr/day 5 days/week for 4 weeks to 40-3000 ppm ethylene did not have a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow, when compared to the control group.",

More than 1000 people (e.g. fire-men, police officers, and workers) were potentially exposed to acrylonitrile and ethylene. Air monitoring in the surrounding was performed, and acrylonitrile was measured in concentrations up to 20 ppm, the mean value being 7 ppm (time range: 8 hr). As many people were concerned about their individual body burden, biomonitoring was recommended for all people involved. 816 persons took advantage of this opportunity and came for blood sampling to the occupational health department of our company. Regarding the lifespan of erythrocytes up to 3 months, it was possible to analyze hemoglobin adducts of acrylonitrile and ethylene during and after the accident. In case of acrylonitrile the hemoglobin adduct N-(2-cyanoethyl) valine and regarding ethylene, N-(2-hydroxyethyl) valine was determined. As a result, the body burden was in nearly all cases within our internal adduct reference values (CyEtVal<15 ug/L blood or <612 pmol/g globin; HyEtVal<15 ug/L blood or 646 pmol/g globin). In about 1% of the cases, the adduct concentrations were slightly above these reference values. This means that the body burden measured by biomonitoring turned out to be far lower than the one expected from the air data. Therefore, following chemical incidents, in case biomonitoring is meaningful, it is highly recommended beside of air monitoring.",

However, abscisic acid content of the tubers increased less when Hydrel was used at growth-stimulating (0.05%) than at growth-inhibiting (0.5 and 1%) concentrations. Abscisic acid concentration in the tubers decreased 90-120 days after the treatment resulting in active tuber sprouting after that time when 0.05% Hydrel was used, while when the high Hydrel concentrations were applied, the abscisic acid concentration remained still at a high level inhibiting the sprouting 120-150 days after treatment and even later. Thus, the increase in abscisic acid concentration resulting from treatment with ethylene donors was the main cause of inhibition of tuber sprouting. The other ethylene donors behaved similarly as Hydrel did also increasing the abscisic acid concentration in the tuber tissues. In the control tubers (treated with 0.05% ethylene donors) the abscisic acid decreased 210 days after the treatment to 0.08 ug/g fresh matter while in tubers treated at 0.5% concentration it remained at that time at a level 10-fold that in the control. A direct relation between the concentration of ethylene donors used for treatment and abscisic acid concentration in the tubers was found.",

The etiology of the disease has not yet been successfully resolved. Here, we quantified the endogenous ethylene content in malformed and healthy vegetative and floral tissues of mango cultivars viz., Amrapali, Bombay green, Chausa, Dushehri and Mallika. Levels of ethylene were higher in malformed vegetative and floral tissues as compared with that of healthy tissues at both prior to full bloom and full bloom stages. The study also revealed that isolates of Fusarium dissected from mango exhibited most morphological similarities to the accepted standard features of Fusarium mangiferae. The growth dynamic of F. mangiferae were evaluated with varying temperatures ranging from 5 to 40 \u00b0C. Temperatures of 25 \u00b0C, 30 \u00b0C and 35 \u00b0C were better suited for growth of F. mangiferae than temperatures of 20 \u00b0C or 40 \u00b0C. Conidium germination of F. mangiferae was maximum at 30 \u00b0C and minimum at <15 \u00b0C. World-wide occurrence of mango malformation showed its most severity at 10-15 \u00b0C temperature range. Stress ethylene level is higher in diseased tissue at the same temperature range where growth of Fusaria is found to be completely restricted. The present study provides direct evidence that low temperature induced 'stress ethylene' is potentially responsible for the disease while on the other hand Fusarium role in the disease either through toxic principle or malformation inducing principle is not conclusive at <15 \u00b0C and is rather out of question.",

While much is known of signaling for stomatal opening induced by blue light and the role of hormones, little is known about the regulation of stomatal closing in darkness. The present study was aimed to verify their role in stomatal regulation in darkness. Epidermal peelings from the leaves of Commelina benghalensis were incubated in a defined medium in darkness for 1 hr followed by a 1 hr incubation in different test solutions [hydrogen peroxide, propyl gallate, ethrel (ethylene), silver nitrate, sodium orthovanadate, tetraethyl ammonium chloride, calcium chloride, lanthanum chloride, separately and in combination] before stomatal apertures were measured under the microscope. In the dark stomata remained closed under treatments with ethylene and propyl gallate but opened widely in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and silver nitrate. The opening effect was largely unaffected by supplementing the treatment with Na-vanadate (PM H+ ATPase inhibitor) and tetraethyl ammonium chloride (K(+)-channel inhibitor) except that opening was significantly inhibited by the latter in presence of hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, hydrogen peroxide could not override the closing effect of ethylene at any concentrations while a marginal opening of stomata was found when silver nitrate treatment was given together with propyl gallate. Calcium chloride treatment opened stomata in the darkness while lanthanum chloride maintained stomata closed. A combination of lanthanum chloride and propyl gallate strongly promoted stomatal opening. A probable action of ethylene in closing stomata of Commelina benghalensis in dark has been proposed.",

Its use as a plant growth regulator will result in its direct release to the environment. Ethylene is a natural product emitted by plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.21X10+4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethylene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase ethylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Ethylene absorbs UV at wavelength 175.2 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethylene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 13. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.228 atm-cu m/mole. Ethylene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. However, ethylene was biodegraded to ethylene oxide using acclimated cell free extracts. If released into water, ethylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hrs and 2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2.6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to ethylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ethylene via inhalation of ambient air and smoking cigarettes. (SRC)",

The release rate of ethylene from plants varies during the life cycle of the plant(1). Plants that normally produce 0.6 to 6 ug ethylene/kg (fresh weight) per hour may produce up to 120 ug/kg per hour during ripening of fruits and during senescence and loss of leaves(1). Ethylene has been found in the gaseous metabolites released by germinating bean, corn, cotton, and pea seeds, from fading morning glory flowers and from ripening avocados and apples(2). Ethylene is released to the atmosphere from biomass combustion and volcanos(3). Photodegradation of dissolved organic material (possibly released from plankton) is expected to be the primary production mechanism of ethylene in the mid-Atlantic ocean(4).",

Gas-phase ethylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.9X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Gas-phase ethylene will also be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and nitrate radicals with respective half-lives of 6.5 and 190 days(4-6). Ethylene absorbs UV at wavelength 175.2 nm(7) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the gas-phase reaction of ethylene with ozone has been estimated as 1.8X10-18 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(3). The rate constant for the gas-phase reaction of ethylene with nitrate radicals (NO3) is measured to be 2.14X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4) which corresponds to a half-life of about 190 days at an atmospheric concentration of 2X10+8 NO3 radicals per cu cm(5). Ethylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6). Ethylene absorbs UV at wavelength 175.2 nm(7) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In June of 1976, ethylene was found in South Texas Coastal waters at a concentration range of 5.8-13.2 nL/L; the major source of ethylene in this area is expected to be offshore petroleum operations(3). In 1977, concentrations of ethylene (20.1 and 20.7 nL/L) were detected in the Gulf of Mexico near the outflow of the Mississippi River and the discharge of formation waters and hydrocarbon venting from offshore oil production; other concentrations monitored in the Gulf of Mexico ranged from 0.6-5 nL/L(4).

Emissions of ethylene from various gasoline fueled engines ranged from 108-135 mg/km driven(2). In another study, emissions of ethylene from various gasoline fueled engines averaged 211.94 mg/km driven in an urban area, 123.2 mg/km driven in a suburban area, 93.39 mg/km driven in a rural area, and 82.58-102.26 mg/km driven on a motorway(3). Furthermore, emissions of ethylene increased from about 6.2 to about 13 % of total hydrocarbon content (THC) when the speed increased from 20 km/hr to about 115 km/hr(3). Ethylene concentrations ranged from 0.04-1.06 ppm in air containing automotive emissions(4). Ethylene has been detected in emissions from alkylate-powered lawn mowers and mopeds(5). The average concentration of ethylene in the Lincoln Tunnel (connecting Weehawhen, NJ with Manhattan Island, NY) was 1,374.9 ppbC in 1970 and 408.7 ppbC in 1982(6). The contribution of vehicle emissions from an attached garage to residential indoor ethylene levels was studied using a 1993 Buick Regal. Ethylene emission rates (mg/test) at cold start were 375 at -10 \u00b0C, 500 at 0 \u00b0C, and 290 at 24 \u00b0C(7).",

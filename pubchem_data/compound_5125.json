They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

By contrast, the adult chicken seems to have difficulty carrying out these processes. The cat is intermediate between rodents and chickens. Although further studies are needed, these results suggest that the hen model may exaggerate the effect of neurotoxic organophosphorus esters. Extrapolation of findings from the chicken may thus overestimate the risk or hazard of organophosphorus esters to humans. This may explain why no human case of O-ethyl-O-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonothioate induced delayed neurotoxicity has been reported despite the fact that it has been in use for over a quarter of a century. Other neurotoxicity data from our laboratory seem to support the suggestion that the cat may be a better model to extrapolate neurotoxicity results to humans. The data presented in this review suggest that the phrmacokinetics and metabolism of organophosphorus esters may play a prominent role in species and age sensitivities for organophosphorus-induced delayed neurotoxicity. Animals that are sensitive to delayed neurotoxicity have a higher accumulation rate, coupled with slower elimination of the neurotoxic agent. These studies, however, do not rule out the possibility that the target tissue of organophosphorus delayed neurotoxicity itself is species or age specific."

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate is found on List B.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

Before administration of pralidoxime, draw a blood sample (heparinized) for cholinesterase analysis (since pralidoxime tends to reverse the cholinesterase depression). Administer pralidoxime (Protopam, 2-PAM), a cholinesterase reactivator, in cases of severe poisoning by organophosphate pesticides in which respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and/or twitching are severe. When administered early (usually less than 48 hours after poisoning) pralidoxime relieves the nicotinic as well as the muscarinic effects of poisoning. Pralidoxime works by reactivating the cholinesterase and also by slowing the \"aging\" process of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a non-reactivatable form. ... Dosage of pralidoxime may be repeated in 1-2 hours, then at 10-12 hour intervals if needed. In very severe poisonings, dosage rates may be doubled. Repeated doses of pralidoxime are usually required. In cases that involve continuing absorption of organophosphate (as after ingestion of large amounts), or continuing transfer of highly lipophilic organophosphate from fat into blood, it may be necessary to continue administration of pralidoxime for several days beyond the 48 hour post-exposure interval usually cited as the limit of its effectiveness. ... Blood pressure should be monitored during administration because of the occasional occurrence of hypertensive crisis. Administration should be slowed or stopped if blood pressure rises to hazardous levels. Be prepared to assist pulmonary ventilation mechanically if respiration is depressed during or after pralidoxime administration. If intravenous injection is not possible, pralidoxime may be given by deep intramuscular injection. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Exposure concentrations were 0, 0.76, 1.2, 1.7, 2.7, 3.6, 6.5 and 9.5 ug/L for Rainbow trout and 0, 0.77, 2.0, 4.8, 10.0 and 19.6 ug/L for Channel catfish. In Rainbow trout growth was reduced by DEF concentrations greater than or equal to 1.2 and survival by concentrations greater than or equal to 3.6 ug/L; growth and survival of channel catfish were reduced by DEF concentrations greater than or equal to 4.8 and 19.6 ug/L, respectively. DEF adversely affected vertebral biochemical composition and mechanical properties of both species. DEF was not highly accumulative in the tissues of either species and was eliminated rapidly when the fish were transferred to contaminant-free water. The determination of safe environmental concentrations of DEF depends partly on the species tested and the biological response measured. Application factors classically used to estimate safe environmental concentrations of contaminants may not be applicable to some of the new-generation organophosphate compounds in relation to cold water species such as Rainbow trout.",

It is also formed in the environment as a result of the release of the defoliant, merphos (S,S,S-tributyl trithiophosphite), which is rapidly oxidized under environmental conditions to tribufos. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.3X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tribufos will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase tribufos will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. Particulate-phase tribufos will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, tribufos is expected to be immobile based upon Koc values of 4,870 to 12,684 measured in 4 soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be important based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.9X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on the vapor pressure. Tribufos is highly persistent in soils with biodegradation half-lives of 745 and 389 days measured in a sandy loam under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. If released into water, tribufos is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the Koc data. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Photolysis in sunlit surface waters does not appear to be an important environmental fate process. Tribufos is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5 and 7; however, the half-life at pH 9 was 124 days. Tribufos degraded slowly in aquatic systems, with half-lives of about 120 to 180 days measured in pond sediment under anaerobic conditions. BCF values of 300 to 1,300 measured in fish, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Occupational exposure to tribufos may occur through inhalation of dusts or dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. The greatest potential for dermal and inhalation exposure to tribufos is expected for applicators and farm workers that have frequent contact with this compound when used as a defoliant for cotton crops. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tribufos via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase tribufos is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).",

The study did not determine whether the observed degradation of tribufos was due to abiotic processes (such as photolysis or hydrolysis) or biological processes(1). Residues of tribufos contained in cotton gin wastes were stable to composting under anaerobic and aerobic conditions(2). The amount of tribufos recovered from an untreated seawater/sediment mixture after 5 days was 20% versus a 77% recovery after 7 days from mixtures that were sterilized with formalin; no volatilization losses were observed in experiments with sediment present(3). A 50% loss was observed in untreated seawater without sediment after accounting for volatilization losses, but no sterilized control experiments were run in seawater alone(3). Some of the losses observed in these experiments may have been due to abiotic hydrolysis(3).",

Since tribufos absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm(2), direct photolysis may be possible in the atmosphere and surface waters(SRC). In experiments studying the persistence of the pesticide merphos (S,S,S-tributyl trithiophosphite) conducted in water from the Little Miami River in sealed glass jars exposed to sunlight and artificial fluorescent light, the amount of tribufos (formed in an apparently quantitative yield from merphos within 1 hr) recovered was 50%, 30%, 10% and <5% after 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively(3). The study did not determine whether the observed degradation of tribufos was due to abiotic processes (such as photolysis or hydrolysis) or biological processes(3). Tribufos was reported to be stable when 1 mg/L sterilized solutions were irradiated with light from a xenon arc lamp (310-740 nm) over a 30 day irradiation period(4). Tribufos was stable at pH 5 and 7 at 24 \u00b0C, but had a hydrolysis half-life of 124 days at pH 9 and 24 \u00b0C(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The greatest potential for dermal and inhalation exposure to tribufos is expected for applicators and farm workers that have frequent contact with this compound when used as a defoliant for cotton crops.

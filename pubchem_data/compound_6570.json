PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In rat liver mitochondria, MVK is an alkylating agent and inhibitor of cellular (mitochondrial) respiration, less potent than acrolein by one order of magnitude. It is an inhibitor of glutamate transport, inorganic phosphate transport, and succinate dehydrogenase activity.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this colorless, pungent-smelling liquid may occur from its use as an alkylating agent, as an intermediate in the synthesis of steroids and vitamin A, and as a precursor in the production of plastics and polymers for packaging materials. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, tachycardia, nausea, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, fainting, coma and death. In activities or situations where over-exposure is possible, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus with full face piece, and full chemical protective clothing specifically recommended by the shipper or producer, including rubber gloves, and boots, and bands around the arms and legs to prevent any skin contact. If contact should occur. immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. Methyl vinyl ketone may be easily ignited by heat, sparks, or flame (flash point: 30 \u00b0F, open cup) in a wide range of concentrations (flammable limits - lower: 2.1%, upper: 15.6%). Its heavier than air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or result in the build-up of explosive concentrations in enclosed spaces such as sewers. Also, containers may explode in the heat of a fire. Fires involving methyl vinyl ketone may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, alcohol or standard foam, water spray or fog (solid streams of water may be ineffective). Since methyl vinyl ketone fires may produce toxic fumes, when tank cars and trucks are involved, isolate the area for 1/2 mile in all directions. Fight fire from as far distance as possible, and dike fire control water. Methyl vinyl ketone should be stored in cool, well ventilated areas, away from direct sunlight, sources of ignition and shipped via air, rail, road, and water in containers bearing the label, \"Flammable liquid\". Small spills of methyl vinyl ketone may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Before implementing land disposal of waste methyl vinyl ketone, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Methyl vinyl ketone has been identified in the volatile emissions of trees and has been found in crabs. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 152 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl vinyl ketone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl vinyl ketone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-life for these reactions in air are estimated to be 20 days and 2.4 days, respectively. Methyl vinyl ketone will also react with atmospheric nitrate with a half-life of 2.1 days. If released to soil, methyl vinyl ketone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3.8. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.65X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl vinyl ketone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 0% theoretical BOD in 5 days using an acclimated sewage inoculum suggests that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, methyl vinyl ketone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 hours and 8.1 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to methyl vinyl ketone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl vinyl ketone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl vinyl ketone via inhalation of ambient air and ingestion of food. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.65X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 hours and 8.1 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 0.41(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 0% theoretical BOD in 5 days using an acclimated sewage inoculum(8,9) suggests that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase methyl vinyl ketone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.88X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The authors found that at small strains delta W/delta I2 did not become negative for any of the samples tested contrary to results which have been reported in the literature. This is in spite of the fact that ... experiments were carried to smaller strains than had been reported previously.",

It has a population density of 1000 per square mile versus 26 for the entire State of Texas.  ... commercial quantities of peroxide are refrigerated continuously to prevent temperature increase and rapid decomposition.  Loss of refrigeration systems for an \"extended\" period of time can result in massive decomposition and fire in peroxide storage tanks. This is where things went wrong at the Arkema Corporation Plant that manufactures a large number of liquid organic peroxides in Crosby, Texas. Hurricane Harvey flooded this Plant where over one half million pounds of peroxides were stored.  Water destroyed the plant's electrical systems and backups thus shutting down refrigeration. \"Fearing that the chemicals might explode the Arkema workers, as a last resort, transferred the peroxides to nine refrigerated trailers on the property.  All but one of the refrigeration units on those trailers eventually failed, the company said.\" Out of fear of explosions the workers had to abandon the plant on August 29, resolved to allow explosions take place and peroxides burn. A perimeter of 1.5 miles around the plant was evacuated due to the various hazards. As time passed trailers warmed up and they exploded one by one and caught fire. Billowing thick black smoke and noxious gases were released every time a tanker exploded and burnt.  Scores of police officers and others were sent to hospital.",

It is used as a polymerization catalyst and vulcanizing agent. HUMAN STUDIES: Organic peroxides in contact with skin can cause irritation and even burns. A case of occupational asthma related to dicumyl peroxide has been reported. Otorhinolaryngologic examination revealed upper respiratory tract diseases in 33.3% of the workers exposed to dicumyl peroxide. ANIMAL STUDIES: In the most severe injuries induced in rabbit eyes there has been great chemosis and formation of gas bubbles in the conjunctiva, cornea, and  anterior chamber. Conjunctiva has become necrotic and the cornea opaque. Dicumyl peroxide was a weak tumor promoter despite its high activity in inducing hyperplasia. Tumor promotion activity of organic peroxides is associated with free radical generation. Dicumyl peroxide causes more than 50% of malformed embryos at any dose in white Leghorn chicken embryos. Dicumyl peroxide gave inconsistent results when tested for mutagenicity using Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA100 and TA104.",

Albino Swedish rabbits were exposed to a mixture of fine polyethylene, ... dicumyl peroxide and an antioxidant or to dicumyl peroxide. Both were applied to the right nostril 3 times a day for 5 days per week at a concentration of 10 or 25 ppm in a quantity equal to 50 microliters of solution. Animals were exposed for 4 weeks and allowed to recover for 8 weeks with periodic examinations beginning at 1 hr. Signs of local irritation or damage were observed. Biopsies of the nasal mucosa were studied by light and transmission electron microscopy and by scanning microscopy. After 1 hr an increased amount of mucus containing red blood cells were seen. After 1 week exposure to either 10 ppm dicumylperoxide or 25 ppm dust an increased number of blood vessels was seen in some animals and aggregates of mucus with erythrocytes were found in all animals. At 1 month there were visible blood vessels on the medial and lateral sides of the nasal cavity not seen in unexposed rabbits. Exposure to dust at 10 ppm for 1 month did not result in any apparent changes in the mucosa. After instillation of dicumyl peroxide or the dust at 25 ppm for 1 month and a 2 month recovery, visible blood vessels were still observed and there was incr crusting and mucus in the nasal cavities of all rabbits. Scanning electron microscopy showed distortion of many cilia beginning as early as 1 hr after exposure. At 5 days areas lacking cilia but still covered with microvilli and areas with clusters of goblet cells appeared. Changes in the mucosa were more pronounced at 1 month with scattered islands without cilia in the mucosal carpet. Only partial recovery was apparent at 2 months after exposure terminated. ...",

At 1 month there were visible blood vessels on the medial and lateral sides of the nasal cavity not seen in unexposed rabbits. Exposure to dust at 10 ppm for 1 month did not result in any apparent changes in the mucosa. After instillation of dicumyl peroxide or the dust at 25 ppm for 1 month and a 2 month recovery, visible blood vessels were still observed and there was incr crusting and mucus in the nasal cavities of all rabbits. Scanning electron microscopy showed distortion of many cilia beginning as early as 1 hr after exposure.

Two of the compounds (di-t-butyl peroxide and dicumyl peroxide) were dialkyl peroxides and the other (di-m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide) was a diacyl peroxide. These compounds were selected based on a previous study in which we evaluated their capacity to induce epidermal hyperplasia, ornithine decarboxylase activity, and dark basal keratinocytes, which have been reliable short-term markers of tumor promotion. Dicumyl peroxide was a weak tumor promoter despite its high activity in inducing hyperplasia. Like benzoyl peroxide, di-m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide generally had intermediate activity as an inducer of short-term markers of tumor promotion and was a moderately effective tumor promoter. However, compared to benzoyl peroxide, di-m-chlorobenzoyl peroxide was more toxic to the skin, which may have limited its tumor-promoting activity. The final compound, di-t-butyl peroxide, which was essentially inactive in short-term assays, was also totally inactive in promoting papillomas or carcinomas in initiated skin. Tumor-promoting efficacy generally showed an inverse association with thermal stability for the compounds tested, suggesting that the rate of formation of free radicals is a key factor contributing to tumor promotion by organic peroxides. However, a number of other factors can potentially affect the activity of different organic peroxides as tumor promoters. Each compound evaluated had a different spectrum of activities, and these compounds should be useful for studying mechanisms of organic peroxide-induced tumor promotion.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.5X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dicumyl peroxide will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dicumyl peroxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 42 hours. Particulate-phase dicumyl peroxide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dicumyl peroxide has the potential to photolyze directly from natural sunlight based on UV absorption bands that extend beyond 290 nm. If released to soil, dicumyl peroxide is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 322,900. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Dicumyl peroxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, dicumyl peroxide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 37 hours and 16 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 21 years when adsorption is considered. BCFs of 137-1470 measured in carp suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Occupational exposure to dicumyl peroxide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dicumyl peroxide is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 37 hours and 16 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 21 years when adsorption is considered(4). According to a classification scheme(5), BCFs of 137-1470 measured in carp(6), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Based on a 0% Theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Japanese MITI test(6), biodegradation of dicumyl peroxide is not expected to be an important enviornmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 37 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 16 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 21 years when adsorption is considered(3). Dicumyl peroxide's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Dicumyl peroxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 7.5X10-6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(1).",

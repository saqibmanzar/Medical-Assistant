Cefixime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and an orally-active third-generation semisynthetic cephalosporin. Cephalosporins are beta-lactam antibiotics and can be used to treat gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections which include conditions such as skin infections, resistant bacteria, and meningitis. Examples of third-generation cephalosporins are [ceftriaxone], [cefotaxime], and [ceftazidime].  Third-generation cephalosporins are often a first-line therapy against certain bacterial infections. However, cefixime is not recommended as a first-line of treatment for uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, or pharyngeal gonorrhea because cefixime does not provide the same bactericidal effect as [ceftriaxone]. Generally, cefixime is used to treat uurinary tract infections, middle ear infections, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated gonorrhea. The beta-lactam ring of cefixime inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins which will then result in lysis. Specifically, cephalosporins inhibit penicillin-sensitive enzymes responsible for the final 3D structure of the bacterial cell wall which in turn inhibit bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis. Additionally, third-generation cephalosporins have been shown to have more stability in the presence of beta-lactamases compared to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Cefixime was first approved in the United States in 1986.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Use of cefixime can result in hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea (CDAD); it may also be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Cell wall formation, recycling, and remodelling require numerous enzymes, including a family of enzymes with similar active site character despite distinct and sometimes overlapping roles as carboxypeptidases, endopeptidases, transpeptidases, and transglycosylases, known as \"penicillin-binding proteins\" (PBPs). The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.  Cefixime is a cephalosporin and cephalosporins work by using their beta-lactam rings to inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to the penicillin-binding proteins transpeptidases on bacteria. The inhibition of synthesis of the bacteria cell wall will cause lysis, particularly in fast growing organisms such as bacteria. Specifically, cephalosporins inhibit penicillin-sensitive enzymes responsible for the final 3D structure of the bacterial cell wall which in turn inhibit bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

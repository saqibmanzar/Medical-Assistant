When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Groups of 50 rats and 50 mice of each sex were fed 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole at one of the following doses, either 300 or 600 ppm for rats, and either 50 or 100 ppm for mice. The rats were dosed for 110 wk, followed by 1 wk of observation; the mice were dosed for 104 wk. Matched controls consisted of 50 untreated rats and 50 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at wk 111, all surviving mice at wk 104. The mean body weights of the groups of rats and mice fed 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole in the diet were slightly lower than those of controls throughout most of the period of admin. No other clinical signs related to admin of the chemical were noted. There was a dose related trend in mortality only in the male rats; however, sufficient numbers of rats were at risk in all groups for development of late appearing tumors. In male rats, there was a significant dose related trend (p=0.044) in the incidence of malignant lymphomas, lymphocytic leukemias, or undifferentiated leukemias, although the results of direct comparisons of incidences in each of the dosed groups with those in controls were not significant. There was also a significant dose related trend in the incidence of granulocytic leukemia in the male rats (p=0.014) and a significantly incr incidence of this tumor (p=0.023) in the high dose group (matched controls 2/50, low dose 4/50, high dose 9/49). When the incidences of all neoplasms of the hematopoietic system (lymphomas and leukemias) were combined, greater significance was attained for both the dose related trend (p=0.001) and direct comparison (p=0.002) of the incidence of the high dose group with that of matched controls (controls 13/50, low dose 9/50, high dose 28/49). The reliability of the incidence of hematopoietic tumors in the male controls was supported by that for male controls observed in a similar bioassay of another test chemical at the same laboratory (13/50). The incidences of the combined hematopoietic tumors in dosed female rats were not significant when compared with the incidence in the matched controls. In female rats, there was a significant dose related trend in the incidence of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary (p=0.016) and a higher incidence (p=0.021) in the high dose group than in matched controls (controls 19/45, low dose 29/47, high dose 29/44). The incidence of this lesion in dosed male rats was much lower than that in dosed females, and the dose related trend (p=0.48) was only marginally significant (controls 3/46, low dose 3/45, high dose 8/43). The incidences of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary which were observed in control groups of rats used in a similar bioassay of another test chemical at the same laboratory were 13/49 (27%) for the males and 26/50 (52%) for the females. Because of the variability in incidences of the tumor among different control groups, the occurrence of chromophobe adenomas of the pituitary in the dosed female rats cannot be clearly associated with admin of the /test cmpd/. Also in femalerats there was a higher incidence of endometrial stomal polyps of the uterus in the low dose group (p=0.023) than in the matched controls (controls 2/50, low dose 9/49, high dose 3/50). Since, however, only three high dose animals had this tumor, the occurrence of uterine tumors in the low dose group cannot clearly be associated with admin of the test chemical. In mice, no neoplasms were observed at a statistically significant incidence in the dosed groups when compared with controls. It is concluded It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, the occurrence of tumors of the hematopoietic system, ie, lymphoma and granulocytic leukemia, in dosed male Fischer 344 rats was associated with administration of 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole. /The cmpd/ was not carcinogenic in female Fischer 344 rats or in male or female B6C3F1 mice. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Positive; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.0X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 80 days. Particulate-phase 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Amino-5-nitrothiazole contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 60. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-amino-5-nitrothiazole is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

PBPs are enzymes involved in the terminal stages of assembling the bacterial cell wall and in reshaping the cell wall during growth and division. Inactivation of PBPs interferes with the cross-linkage of peptidoglycan chains necessary for bacterial cell wall strength and rigidity.

At the present meeting, the Committee concluded that it could not extend the temporary ADI or MRLs established at its 58th meeting based on: lack of data on the identity and toxicity of the unidentified residues of cefuroxime in milk; the fact that the database was insufficient to allow for evaluation of the metabolism or degradation of cefuroxime in milk; and the fact that the radiolabelled-residue depletion study in cows could no longer be used to determine the relationship between residues of parent compound, other antimicrobial active residues, and total residues of cefuroxime. Therefore, the temporary ADI and MRLs for cefuroxime in milk were withdrawn.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Amifostine is a prodrug that is dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase in tissues to a pharmacologically active free thiol metabolite, believed to be responsible for the reduction of the cumulative renal toxicity of cisplatin and for the reduction of the toxic effects of radiation on normal oral tissues. Healthy cells are preferentially protected because amifostine and metabolites are present in healthy cells at 100-fold greater concentrations than in tumour cells.",

Patients were treated with a single dose or three doses of amifostine (740 or 910 mg/sq m). The single or first dose was given as a 15 min iv infusion just before administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. The additional two infusions were administered 2 and 4 hr thereafter. Amifostine was rapidly cleared from the plasma, due to, at least in part, the fast conversion into WR 1065. A biphasic decrease with a final half-life of 0.8 hr was observed. The active metabolite WR 1065 was cleared from the plasma with a final half-life of 7.3 +/- 3.6 hr. The short initial half-life of WR 1065 can be explained by its fast uptake in tissues and the formation of disulphides. The disulphides were cleared with a final half-life of 8.4-13.4 hr and were detectable for at least 24 hr after treatment. They may serve as an exchangeable pool of WR 1065. The amifostine peak values at the end of each 15 min infusion did not accumulate in the multiple dosing schedule. For WR 1065 a trend towards an increase in the peak levels was observed [C1,max: 47.5 +/- 11.9 uM, C2,max: 79.0 +/- 13.2 uM, C3,max: 84.8 +/- 15.1 uM, (n = 6)], whereas a trend towards a small decrease was observed for the peak levels of the disulphides [C1,max: 184.2 +/- 12.6 uM, C2,max: 175.0 +/- 23.7 uM, C3,max: 166.0 +/- 17.2 uM, (n = 6)]. This latter finding might suggest a saturation of the disulphide formation or a change in the uptake or elimination of WR 1065, which would result in higher WR 1065 levels in plasma and tissues, after multiple doses of amifostine.",

It is known that /radiation/ protection requires conversion of the parent drug to its free thiol metabolite, WR-1065, in cultured cells. Because it is possible that metabolites of WR-1065 could be involved in protection and because thiols are metabolically very reactive molecules, we investigated the metabolism of WR-2721 using electrochemical detection-HPLC methods. The following are the major findings in this study: 1) WR-2721 drug was rapidly cleared from the bloodstream. Blood concentration of the parent drug decreased 10-fold 30 min after administration from the maximal observed value at 5 min 2) WR-1065 rapidly appeared in the perchloric acid (PCA)-soluble fraction of normal solid tissues. The highest WR-1065 concentrations in liver and kidney were 965 and 2195 mumol/kg, respectively, 10 min after parent drug administration, whereas for heart and small intestine the highest values were 739 and 410 mumol/kg at 30 min. 3) WR-1065 accumulated in the PCA-soluble fraction of two experimental tumors at a lower rate than for the other tissues.",

Patients were treated with a single dose or three doses of amifostine (740 or 910 mg/sq m). The single or first dose was given as a 15 min iv infusion just before administration of the chemotherapeutic agent. The additional two infusions were administered 2 and 4 hr thereafter. Amifostine was rapidly cleared from the plasma, due to, at least in part, the fast conversion into WR 1065. A biphasic decrease with a final half-life of 0.8 hr was observed. The active metabolite WR 1065 was cleared from the plasma with a final half-life of 7.3 +/- 3.6 hr. The short initial half-life of WR 1065 can be explained by its fast uptake in tissues and the formation of disulphides. The disulphides were cleared with a final half-life of 8.4-13.4 hr and were detectable for at least 24 hr after treatment. They may serve as an exchangeable pool of WR 1065. ...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The pharmacologically active free sulfhydryl is believed to bind to and detoxify cytotoxic platinum-containing metabolites of cisplatin and scavenge free radicals induced by the drug. Cytoprotection against cisplatin-induced toxicity appears to result from prevention and/or, to a lesser extent, reversal of DNA platination by the drug (cisplatin-DNA adducts). Healthy cells appear to be protected preferentially because of the increased cellular uptake of amifostine and more rapid generation of the active free sulfhydryl metabolite in these cells compared with malignant cells. Because healthy cells have better perfusion, higher capillary alkaline phosphatase activity, and higher pH than malignant cells, and actively concentrate amifostine while malignant cells absorb the drug passively, there is increased cellular uptake of amifostine and more rapid generation of the free active sulfhydryl; therefore, compared with malignant cells, healthy cells appear to be selectively protected by amifostine against cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity.",

We have previously shown that amifostine protects both chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) vessels and cells from the effects of X-rays. In the present work, we studied the effect of amifostine on angiogenesis in vivo, using the CAM model. Amifostine decreased the number of CAM vessels in a dose-dependent manner, without being toxic for the tissue. It also decreased the mRNA levels of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms VEGF(165) and VEGF(190), 6 and up to 48 hr after its application onto the CAM. Similarly, it decreased the mRNA levels of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, 24 and 48 hr after drug application. Furthermore, amifostine decreased the deposited amounts of laminin and collagen I 24 hr after its application, without affecting the expression of the corresponding genes. The protein amounts and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 were not affected, whereas the expression of the corresponding gene was decreased up to 48 hr after drug application. Finally, the activity of plasmin was increased 6 hr after amifostine application and remained increased at later time points. These findings suggest that amifostine alters the expression of several molecules implicated in the angiogenesis process and affects the composition of the extracellular matrix in a way that leads to inhibition of angiogenesis. Such an antiangiogenic action of amifostine, together with its radioprotective effects, further supports its use in combination with radiotherapy for increased therapeutic efficacy.",

DILIrank assigns a severity grade, ranging from 0 (no-DILI-concern) to 8 (fatal hepatotoxicity).",

A significant (P < 0.002) increase in urinary NAG after treatment was documented only in cisplatin-treated group 2 [day 2 (mean+/-SE), 93+/-2.1 units/gram creatinine; day 4, 70.6+/-16 units/gram creatinine; normalization at day 8]. Treatment with amifostine before cisplatin administration resulted in a slight urinary NAG leakage (day 2, 2.8+/-1.8 units/gram creatinine; day 4, 13.8+/-13 units/gram creatinine; normalization at day 6). No increase in urinary enzyme levels was seen in the other groups, and there were no significant differences in urinary magnesium between all groups.

Repeated peroral administration of melatonin and ascorbic acid in a dose of 200 mg/kg 30 min before treatment with gammafos reduced its cumulative toxic effect. Succinic acid in a dose of 100 mg/kg was ineffective under these conditions.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Rapid and selective pulmonary vasodilation is desired in order to restore hemodynamic stability. This pilot study examined the effectiveness of inhaled amyl nitrite as a selective pulmonary vasodilator. Nine adult swine were anesthetized. Acute pulmonary hypertension with hemodynamic collapse was induced with a bolus administration of a thromboxane analogue, U46619. Six animals then received a capsule of amyl nitrite. The administration of inhaled amyl nitrite decreased mean pulmonary artery pressure from 42 +/- 3 to 22 +/ 3 mm Hg at five minutes (p < 0.05), with a concomitant increase in cardiac output and mean arterial pressure. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 4889 +/- 1338 to 380 +/- 195 dyne. sec. cm(-5) (by 92% from the maximal pulmonary hypertension change), with significant improvement in systemic hemodynamics.

In this retrospective study, we evaluate the safety of amyl nitrite use during preterm cesarean deliveries, and we assess possible advantageous effects on surgical incision choice. Women who received amyl nitrite cesarean section were compared to a control group matched for gestational age, fetal presentation, and mode of delivery who did not receive amyl nitrite. There were no statistical differences between the groups in the independent variables (maternal age, parity, medical or obstetric history, type of anesthesia, anesthesia or obstetric attending physician, antepartum hematocrit, or neonatal weight). Outcome (dependent) variables (estimated blood loss, Apgar scores, postpartum hematocrit, cord gases, or postpartum complications) were assessed, and there were no significant differences between the groups. Low transverse cesarean section was performed more frequently in the amyl nitrite group (58 of 64) than in the comparison group (48 of 64) (p less than 0.03). Considering the 128 women with and without amyl nitrite together, the decrease in hematocrit observed postpartum was greater after classic section (7%) than after low transverse section (4%) (p less than 0.002). We conclude that the use of amyl nitrite during preterm cesarean section poses no threat to mother or fetus and may facilitate delivery by allowing the performance of a low transverse rather than a classic cesarean section without maternal or neonatal complications.",

Amyl nitrite is a smooth muscle relaxant that has been used clinically to facilitate uterine relaxation in difficult deliveries. The use of amyl nitrite has been associated with sexual risk behavior and HIV infection among gay and bisexual men. HUMAN STUDIES: Inhalation of amyl nitrite by human volunteers in a gas mask and from ampoules crushed close to the nose did not induce hemoglobin oxidation, but it was associated with headache, tiredness, dizziness, and a fall in blood pressure. Two cases of amyl nitrite poisoning were presented. In both cases, severe methemoglobinemia developed after ingestion of approximately 10 mL of amyl nitrite. When admitted to hospital, both patients were deeply cyanosed, and arterial blood samples were noticed to be chocolate brown. There is also a case of a 37-year-old black man with HIV who developed chemical leukoderma in the nasal and perioral areas within 4 weeks of spilling liquid amyl nitrite, which he had been inhaling as a recreational drug, on his lower face. A case of blinding bilateral acute optic nerve disease was reported in a 15-year-old male apparently induced by inhalation of amyl nitrite. A patient with HIV infection developed a profound hemolytic anemia after repeated inhalation of large quantities of amyl nitrite. Amyl nitrite 'poppers' are recreational drugs, which are a potent source of nitric oxide. The use of 'poppers' can cause psychoactive stimulation, reduced blood pressure, tachycardia and involuntary muscle relaxation. In addition, research has found that popper use suppresses natural killer (NK) cell function, which increases vulnerability to infectious agents, produces sustained alterations in the immune system, and may be a Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) cofactor. The combined data implicate that the use of poppers may well pose as a significant risk factor for seroconversion. ANIMAL STUDIES: Amyl nitrite i.v. produced HbFe3+ much more rapidly than NaNO2 in dogs, cats, rabbits, and rats. In dogs, i.m. injection of amyl nitrite was followed by a very slow linear increase in the HbFe3+ content. Inhalation of  amyl nitrite did not lead to HbFe3+ formation in dogs unless it was rebreathed in a closed (bag) or not completely open (gas mask) system. HbFe3+ was produced by oral amyl nitrite in dogs, the effect being enhanced by addition of DMSO. Intratracheal inhalation of amyl nitrite in the pentobarbitone/urethane anesthetized rabbit caused reductions in tidal volume and both inspiratory and expiratory times, without a preceding apnea, that were independent of the associated hypotension and of reflex influences from the carotid sinus region but dependent on supra-abdominal vagal integrity. In artificially ventilated, paralyzed rabbits amyl nitrite caused a pronounced sensitization of pulmonary stretch receptors during the inflation phase, typically with a reduction in the level of activity during the deflation phase. When tested for genotoxicity, amyl nitrite, was negative in the mouse lymphoma assay, but it was positive in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay.",

CBF was measured with the same technique, under identical laboratory conditions, in an equal number of normal volunteers. During CBF measurements, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and end-tidal levels of carbon dioxide were monitored. The amyl nitrite group and the control group were compared on CBF, rating scale scores and physiological indices via analysis of variance. Amyl nitrite inhalation was associated with significant global increases in CBF, while the control group did not show any change. Pulse rate increase was the only physiological change associated with administration of the drug. Subjects who received the drug reported significant decrease in anger, fatigue and depression and increased palpitation, breathing difficulty, dizziness and headache. Changes in the rating scale scores, physiological indices, and somatic symptoms after amyl nitrite did not correlate with regional CBF change.",

In artificially ventilated, paralyzed rabbits amyl nitrite caused a pronounced sensitization of pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs) during the inflation phase, typically with a reduction in the level of activity during the deflation phase. The time course of the change in the pattern of PSR activity paralleled that of the tachypneic response. The sensitization of a small sample of rapidly adapting 'irritant' receptors was of a significantly shorter duration. A unitary analysis of non-myelinated vagal afferents was not attempted. The sensitization of these vagal afferents cannot be attributed to the smooth muscle relaxant properties of amyl nitrite since other relaxants (sodium nitrite, sodium nitroprusside, phentolamine) did not possess this capacity, and such properties would be expected to diminish their activities.",

A prolonged vagally-independent potentiation succeeded the initial inhibition. The potentiation of intercostal activity may account for the increase in tidal volume produced by amyl nitrite after vagotomy. The patellar reflex potentiation survived thoracolumbar spinal transection but could not be attributed to a direct facilitation of neuromuscular or muscular events. A correlation existed between the relative dependence of fusimotor support of a muscle and its susceptibility to the inhibitory and subsequent facilitatory affects of amyl nitrite inhalation. The diaphragm and interchondral muscles, essentially independent of the autogenetic facilitation provided by muscle spindles, demonstrated neither of these effects. Conversely, the intercostal muscles depend greatly on such facilitation, as do the pectoral and limb muscles during thermal shivering.",

Preliminary observations indicated that the portion of the male homosexual community which developed Kaposi's sarcoma were also heavy nitrite users. These nitrites had been demonstrated to be mutagenic in bacteria and thus it was postulated that they could be responsible for the appearance of the sarcoma. To evaluate further the genotoxic activity of these chemicals, six nitrites, including those most commonly used by homosexuals for sexual gratification, were selected for testing in the mouse lymphoma TK+/- and Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assays. One chemical, n-amyl nitrite, was negative in the mouse lymphoma assay, while the other five chemicals, n-butyl, isobutyl, iso-amyl, sec-butyl, and n-propyl nitrite, were positive. All six compounds were positive in the Salmonella assay. The mutagenic and known toxic effects of these chemicals remain a concern because a large population of teenagers and young adults continue to abuse these substances.",

In in vivo studies AN was administered intravenously (i.v.), intramuscularly (i.m.), by inhalation, or orally. NaNO2 was injected i.v.. AN i.v. produced HbFe3+ much more rapidly than NaNO2 in dogs, cats, rabbits, and rats. In dogs, i.m. injection of AN was followed by a very slow linear increase in the HbFe3+ content. Inhalation of AN did not lead to HbFe3+ formation in dogs unless it was rebreathed in a closed (bag) or not completely open (gas mask) system. HbFe3+ was produced by oral AN in dogs, the effect being enhanced by addition of DMSO. Inhalation of AN by human volunteers in a gas mask and from ampoules crushed close to the nose did not induce hemoglobin oxidation to a practically significant extent, but it was associated with headache, tiredness, dizziness, and a fall in blood pressure. In in vitro studies, in contrast to NaNO2, AN produced HbFe3+ instantaneously in erythrocytes of various species and in purified human hemoglobin. AN 1 mol yielded 2 mol Fe3+. Only 20% of the oxygen released during the oxidation of hemoglobin by AN or NaNO2 was recovered. In 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.01 mol O2/mol AN was consumed. CO2 was released in the presence of AN, but not of NaNO2, from blood, plasma, and 0.02 M NaHCO3 solution. The ratio (lactate)/(pyruvate) decreased when HbFe3+ was formed by AN or NaNO2.",

Its use in perfumes and as a inhalant as well as a drug of abuse will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.97 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-amyl nitrite will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-amyl nitrite will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days. n-Amyl nitrite absorbs UV light at wavelength 356 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-amyl nitrite is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 440. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. n-Amyl nitrite may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, n-amyl nitrite is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 hrs and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 35 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to n-amyl nitrite may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-amyl nitrite is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-amyl nitrite via inhalation of perfumes and administration or abuse of medical inhalants and homeopathic remedies containing n-amyl nitrite.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

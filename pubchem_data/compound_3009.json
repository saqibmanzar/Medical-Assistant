Further research has also implicated ornithine decarboxylase in other conditions like facial hirsutism and cancer, especially when ornithine decarboxylase is highly upregulated in tumor cells. Additionally, ornithine decarboxylase is activated by c-myc or interacts with ras, both very well-known oncogenes, thus increasing the interest in targeting ornithine carboxylase as a potential cancer treatment.  In 1960 and 2000, the FDA approved eflornithine under the brand names ORNIDYL and VANIQUA for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis and hirsutism, respectively, but has since been discontinued. Subsequently, on December 14, 2023, the FDA approved eflornithine again but under the brand name IWILFIN as an oral maintenance therapy to reduce the risk of relapse in adult and pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have demonstrated at least a partial response to prior multiagent, multimodality therapy, including anti-GD2 immunotherapy. This approval is based on positive results obtained from a multi-site, single-arm, externally controlled study of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, where a 52% reduction in the risk of relapse and a 68% reduction in the risk of death were observed.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It was hoped that this enzyme-activated, irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the first enzyme in polyamine synthesis, would be effective as a chemotherapy for hyperproliferative diseases, including cancer and/or infectious processes. DFMO was generally found to exert cytostatic effects on mammalian cells and tissues, and its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent has been modest. DFMO was also found to cause treatment-limiting (but reversible) ototoxicity at high doses. This side effect, along with its minimal therapeutic activity, contributed to the loss of interest by many clinicians in further developing DFMO as a cancer therapeutic agent. However, DFMO was subsequently shown to inhibit carcinogen-induced cancer development in a number of rodent models, and interest in developing this compound as a preventive agent has increased. The rationale for the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase as a cancer chemopreventive agent has been strengthened in recent years because this enzyme has been shown to be transactivated by the c-myc oncogene in certain cell/tissue types and to cooperate with the ras oncogene in malignant transformation of epithelial tissues. Recent clinical cancer chemoprevention trials, using dose de-escalation designs, indicate that DFMO can be given over long periods of time at low doses that suppress polyamine contents in gastrointestinal and other epithelial tissues but cause no detectable hearing loss or other side effects. Current clinical chemoprevention trials are investigating the efficacy of DFMO to suppress surrogate end point biomarkers (e.g., colon polyp recurrence) of carcinogenesis in patient populations at elevated risk for the development of specific epithelial cancers, including colon, esophageal, breast, cutaneous, and prostate malignancies.",

The polyamine synthesis inhibitor eflornithine (difluoromethylornithine, DFMO) has emerged as an alternative therapy. 207 patients with late-stage T b gambiense sleeping sickness were treated in rural Zaire with three different regimens of DFMO in an open-trial design. During treatment, trypanosomes disappeared from the CSF of all 87 patients in whom parasites had been seen before DFMO administration, and there was a sharp fall in CSF white cell count from a mean of 186/microliters to 21/microliters. 152 patients have been followed for at least a year after DFMO treatment, and only 13 (9%) have relapsed. Treatment failures were more common in children less than 12 years, among patients treated with oral DFMO only, and among patients who received DFMO as the initial treatment of their recently diagnosed trypanosomiasis. Toxicity was acceptable. Only 4 patients died during or shortly after treatment. Bone marrow suppression resulting in anaemia (43%) or leucopenia (53%) was common but bore little consequence. This open trial shows that DFMO is as active as and possibly less toxic than melarsoprol. For economic and logistic reasons DFMO may not be the first-choice therapy in rural Africa but for the vast majority of patients who relapse after melarsoprol DFMO will be curative.",

A polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor, eflornithine (chemical name, DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, supplied as monohydrochloride monohydrate), was used to treat a 3 1/2-year-old child with newly diagnosed severe trypanosomiasis that had been acquired more than two years previously in Zaire or the Congo. Treatment consisted of 300 to 400 mg/kg/d of eflornithine by continuous intravenous infusion for 25 days followed by 300 mg/kg/d of eflornithine by mouth divided in four equal doses daily for 17 days. The child's recovery was dramatic, with eradication of blood and cerebrospinal fluid parasites in the first week. Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis resolved completely. Her generalized adenopathy and fever gradually resolved. Severe ataxia, inability to walk or to change posture on her own, marked language regression, and lethargy all improved during and after her therapy. The drug was well tolerated; the only noted adverse effect was transient thrombocytopenia during the fourth week of therapy. Eflornithine was a safe and effective agent for treatment of trypanosomiasis with central nervous system involvement in this child.",

In vitro, eflornithine induced senescence and suppressed neurosphere formation in MYCN-amplified and MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma cells, indicating a cytostatic effect. Treatment with eflornithine prevented or delayed tumor formation in mice injected with limiting dilutions of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.  Additionally, polyamines are also involved in keratin synthesis, and inhibition of polyamines can decrease the proliferation of hair matrix cells and thus inhibit the anagen phase of hair production.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The Cmax and AUC (area under the concentration-time curve) of eflornithine were not affected by food (high fat and high calories). Administration of crushed tablets in a standard pudding admixture had no effect on eflornithine exposure (Cmax and AUC6h).   The mean percutaneous absorption of eflornithine in women with unwanted facial hair, from a 13.9% w/w cream formulation, is < 1% of the radioactive dose, following either single or multiple doses under conditions of clinical use, that included shaving within 2 hours before radiolabeled dose application in addition to other forms of cutting or plucking and tweezing to remove facial hair. Steady state was reached within four days of twice-daily application. Following twice-daily application of 0.5 g of the cream (total dose 1.0 g/day; 139 mg as anhydrous eflornithine hydrochloride), under conditions of clinical use in women with unwanted facial hair (n=10), the steady-state Cmax, Ctrough and AUC12hr were approximately 10 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, and 92 ng hr/mL, respectively, expressed in terms of the anhydrous free base of eflornithine hydrochloride. At steady state, the dose-normalized peak concentrations (Cmax) and the extent of daily systemic exposure (AUC) of eflornithine following twice-daily application of 0.5 g of the cream (total dose 1.0 g/day) is estimated to be approximately 100- and 60-fold lower, respectively, when compared to 370 mg/day once-daily oral doses.",

The mechanism(s) by which topically applied eflornithine hydrochloride reduces hair growth has not been fully elucidated. Results of several studies using oral eflornithine hydrochloride indicate that the drug may inhibit ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of intracellular polyamines required for cell division and differentiation. Limited animal data indicate that such inhibition of cell division and differentiation may affect the rate of hair growth. The manufacturer of topical eflornithine hydrochloride states that there are no published studies in humans on the ODC inhibitory potential of topical eflornithine hydrochloride.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

In a repeated insult patch test (230 subjects), erythema with edema occurred in 38.9% of subjects treated with eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream and 4.8% of subjects treated with vehicle cream. Challenge applications at previously untested sites following the three-week induction period produced noticeable erythema or greater on only four sites treated with eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream and one vehicle-treated site. The erythema at these sites subsided substantially within 24 hours. In a three-week cumulative irritation study (30 subjects), the mean irritation score for sites treated with eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream was 1.33, compared with 0.76 at vehicle-treated sites and 3.09 at positive-control (sodium lauryl sulphate-treated) sites (p < 0.001 between all three groups). In a phototoxicity study (25 subjects), irradiated sites showed either no reaction (40% of both sites treated with eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream and vehicle-treated sites), or mild erythema subsiding in all cases but one within 24 hours. No reaction was seen at non-irradiated sites. In a photocontact allergy study (30 subjects), challenge with eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream or its vehicle alone produced either no reaction or mild erythema subsiding within 24 hours at both irradiated and non-irradiated sites. No serious adverse events were reported during the studies, and the only adverse events considered related to treatment were pruritus (three subjects) and dry skin at test site (one subject). These results demonstrate that eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream does not have contact sensitising, photocontact allergic or phototoxic properties. It can cause irritation under exaggerated conditions of use. Eflornithine HCl 13.9% cream, therefore, has a favorable dermal safety profile appropriate for a topical treatment to be applied routinely.",

Preclinical developmental toxicity studies in pregnant rats and rabbits /were conducted/.. Rats were treated during GD 6-17, and fetuses were obtained by C-section on GD 20. Rabbits were treated during GD 7-20, and fetuses were obtained by C-section on GD 29. The dose range-finding study in rats (5/group at 0, 50, 125, 300, 800, or 1000 mg/kg/day) revealed maternal toxicity at doses > or = 800 mg/kg/day (decreased body weights and food consumption) and developmental toxicity at doses > or = 300 mg/kg/day (increased early resorptions and reduced fetal body weights). In the main study, rats (25/group) received 0, 30, 80, or 200 mg/kg/day. Developmental toxicity in the absence of maternal toxicity was observed at 200 mg/kg/day as significantly decreased fetal weights and increased incidence of litters with skeletal variations of 14th rudimentary rib, 14th full rib, and/or 27th presacral vertebrae. There were no treatment-related fetal skeletal malformations or external or visceral anomalies at any dose level. The dose range-finding study in rabbits (5/group at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, or 500 mg/kg/day) revealed developmental toxicity at doses > or = 60 mg/kg/day (increased resorptions and reduced fetal body weights) in the absence of maternal toxicity. In the main study, rabbits (20/group) received 0, 15, 45, or 135 mg/kg/day. Developmental toxicity in the absence of maternal toxicity was observed at 135 mg/kg/day as nonsignificantly increased early resorptions, decreased implantation sites, decreased viable fetuses, and reduced fetal weights. There were no external, visceral, or skeletal anomalies at any dose level. Thus, in the main developmental toxicity studies, DFMO produced developmental but not maternal toxicity at 200 and 135 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively. Accordingly, in rats, the maternal no-observable-effect level (NOEL) was 200 mg/kg/day and the fetal NOEL was 80 mg/kg/day; while in rabbits the maternal NOEL was 135 mg/kg/day and the fetal NOEL was 45 mg/kg/day. ...",

Treatment failures /with eflornithine/ have been infrequent but have occurred among patients treated with oral DFMO only, and among children. To investigate the higher frequency of failures observed in young patients, DFMO trough concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured at the end of treatment in 13 children and 50 adults who had received 200 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hr for 14 d. Mean DFMO concentration in CSF was significantly lower among children aged less than 12 years when compared to older patients (25.1 vs 68.9 nmol/mL, P < 0.001). Mean serum concentration was also lower in children (49.2 vs 87.5 nmol/mL, P = 0.03). Among patients who received DFMO as initial therapy for sleeping sickness, the mean CSF/serum ratio was lower in children (0.41 vs 0.91, P < 0.005). The 3 patients who failed DFMO treatment had CSF trough concentrations around or below 50 nmol/mL. Convulsions and anemia were associated with higher drug levels and previous therapy with melarsoprol. The lower CSF drug concentrations observed in children could result from higher renal clearance and different CSF pharmacokinetics of DFMO in that age group. To avoid treatment failures, a 6-hourly regimen as well as higher DFMO dosage based on body surface area rather than on weight are recommended for children.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

No compounds containing the ZnCl4 6 ion have been characterized. Four crystalline forms, (polymorphs) , of ZnCl2 are known, and in each case the Zn2+ ions are trigonal planar coordinated to four chloride ions. The pure anhydrous orthorhombic form rapidly changes to one of the other forms on exposure to the atmosphere and a possible explanation is that the presence of OH facilitates the rearrangement. Rapid cooling of molten ZnCl2 gives a glass, that is, a rigid amorphous solid and this ability has been related to the structure in the melt.<br /> Zinc chloride belongs to the family of Transition Metal Chlorides. These are inorganic compounds in which the largest halogen atom is Chlorine, and the heaviest metal atom is a transition metal.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Zinc is cytoprotective against reactive oxygen species mediated apoptosis through the action of metallothioneins.  In a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via the TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8.  In patients with diarrhea, zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity, restores enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, promotes the production of antibodies, and promotes the production of circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens. Zinc also directly affects ion channels as a potassium channel blocker of cAMP-mediated chlorine secretion.  Zinc deficiency decreases thymulin, inhibiting T-helper cell maturation and decreased Th-1 cytokines like IL-2. Decreased IL-2 decreases the activity of NK cells and CD8+ T cells. Zinc deficiency also leads to the generation of CD4+ T cells, decreased NF-\u03baB activation, decreased phosphorylation of I\u03baB, and decreased binding of NF-\u03baB to DNA.",

Following pretreatment with zinc chloride, hepatocytes were treated with 20 or 40 uM silver nitrate for 24 hr, and cytotoxicity was then assessed by enzyme leakage and loss of intracellular potassium. The toxicity of silver was significantly less in the zinc-pretreated cells. Furthermore, although zinc pretreatment had no appreciable effect on the hepatocellular uptake of silver, it did alter the subcellular distribution, and silver accumulated more in the cytosol and less in the nuclear, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions. Silver in the cytosol of control cells was bound primarily to high molecular weight proteins, whereas silver was mainly associated with MT in the zinc-pretreated cells. Zinc-induced MT in rat primary hepatocyte cultures protects against silver-induced cytotoxicity which results from the binding of silver to MT with a concomitant reduction of metal content in critical organelles and proteins.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Zinc chloride is found on List D. Case No: 4099; Pesticide type: fungicide, herbicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: RED Approved 09/92; OPP has made a decision that some/all uses of the pesticide are eligible for reregistration, as reflected in a Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): Zinc chloride; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 10/07/92; AI Status: OPP has completed a Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document for the case/AI.",

Zinc oxide (20% suspension dilute Tween 80), zinc sulphate (1% aqueous solution) and zinc pyrithione (20% suspension) were not overtly irritant, but induced a margina epidermal hyperplasia and increased hair growth. Zinc undecylenate (20% suspension) was not irritant. Epidermal irritancy in these studies is related to the interaction of zinc ion with epidermal keratin.

Chloroprocaine can be given as an injection, and is available in formulations with and without methylparaben as a preservative. Both can be given as intrathecal injections for peripheral and central nerve block, but only the preservative-free formulation can be used for lumbar and caudal epidural blocks. Topical chloroprocaine for ophthalmic use was approved by the FDA in September 2022 for ocular surface anesthesia.",

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Compared with lidocaine and bupivacaine, chloroprocaine has shorter ambulation and discharge times. Chloroprocaine has minimal effects on cardiac conduction, excitability, refractoriness, contractility, and peripheral vascular resistance at therapeutic doses. However, at toxic blood concentrations, chloroprocaine may cause atrioventricular block and cardiac arrest, as well as decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure. A high concentration of chloroprocaine in plasma can also lead to central nervous system stimulation, depression, or both. Some signs of central stimulation include restlessness, tremors and shivering, which may progress to convulsions. Depression, coma and respiratory arrest may also occur. As with other local anesthetics, patients may experience depression of the central nervous system without a prior stage of stimulation.",

The presence of epinephrine reduces the rate of absorption and plasma concentration of local anesthetics.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The progression of anesthesia depends on the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of nerve fibers, and the order of loss of nerve function is the following: 1) pain, 2) temperature, 3) touch, 4) proprioception, and 5) skeletal muscle tone.",

Restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, tinnitus, blurred vision or tremors may occur, possibly proceeding to convulsions. High doses, or unintended intravascular injection, may lead to high plasma levels and related depression of the myocardium, hypotension, bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias and, possibly, cardiac arrest. Neurologic side effects These observations may include spinal block of varying magnitude (including total spinal block), hypotension secondary to spinal block, loss of bladder and bowel control, and loss of perineal sensation and sexual function. Arachnoiditis, persistent motor, sensory and/or autonomic (sphincter control) deficit of some lower spinal segments with slow recovery (several months) or incomplete recovery have been reported in rare instances.

Should convulsions persist despite adequate respiratory support, and if the status of the circulation permits, small increments of an ultra-short acting barbiturate (such as thiopental or thiamylal) or a benzodiazepine (such as diazepam) may be administered intravenously; the clinician should be familiar, prior to the use of anesthetics, with these anti-convulsant drugs. Supportive treatment of circulatory depression may require administration of intravenous fluids and, when appropriate, a vasopressor dictated by the clinical situation (such as ephedrine to enhance myocardial contractile force).  If cardiac arrest should occur, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures should be instituted. (L1712)",

All four drugs produced a concn dependent incr in every measure of injury assessed by light microscopy with computer assisted morphometry of transverse 1 mu thick sections. Edema, lipid inclusions and fiber injury were /observed/ predominantly in the subperineural region and to a lesser degree in the central of nerve fascicles. ...

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

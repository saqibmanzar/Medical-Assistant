Quinidine sulfate exerts its anti-malarial activity by acting primarily as an intra-erythrocytic schizonticide through association with the hemepolymer (hemozoin) in the acidic food vacuole of the parasite thereby preventing further polymerization by heme polymerase enzyme. This results in accumulation of toxic heme and death of the parasite. Quinidine sulfate exerts its antiarrhythmic effects by depressing the flow of sodium ions into cells during phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, thereby slowing the impulse conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node, reducing the rate of phase 0 depolarization and prolonging the refractory period. Quinidine sulfate also reduces the slope of phase 4 depolarization in Purkinje-fibres resulting in slowed conduction and reduced automaticity in the heart.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Congestive heart failure is associated with hypoperfusion to various organs including the sites of drug clearance, ie the liver and kidneys. It also leads to organ congestion as seen in the liver and gut. Not all adverse reactions to drugs that may occur in heart failure are the result of alterations in pharmacokinetics; rather, some may be due to important drug interactions. An interaction may occur directly eg reduction of renal clearance of digoxin by captopril and quinidine; or indirectly, eg through diuretic induced hypokalemia, which exacerbate arrhythmias associated with digoxin and antiarrhythmics such as quinidine and procainamide. /Quinidine/",

Quinidine is an alkaloid that may be derived from various species of Cinchona.  Cinchona barks contain 0.25 to 3.0% quinidine.  Quinidine is also prepared from quinine.  Quinidine is a powder or white crystals, odorless with a bitter taste. Quinidine bisulfate is colorless crystals which is odorless and has a bitter taste. Quinidine gluconate is a white powder which is odorless and has a bitter taste. Quinidine poly-galacturonate is a powder. Quinidine sulfate is a white powder or odorless crystals with a bitter taste.  Indications: Description: Premature ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia; supraventricular arrhythmia; maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation.  HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: Cardio-toxicity is the main risk of quinidine poisoning.  Quinidine may induce central nervous system symptoms.  Summary of clinical effects: Toxic effects appear within 2 - 4 hours after ingestion but the delay may vary according to the quinidine salt and to the preparation forms.  Symptoms may include disturbances of cardiac rhythm (especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease), neurotoxicity and respiratory depression. Diagnosis: Cardiac disturbances: circulatory arrest, shock, conduction disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias, ECG changes, Neurological symptoms: tinnitus, drowsiness, syncope, coma, convulsions, delirium.  Respiratory depression.  Quinidine concentrations may be helpful in diagnosis but are not useful for clinical management.  Contraindications: Allergy or idiosyncrasy to cinchona alkaloids;   atrioventricular or complete heart block; intraventricular conduction defects; absence of atrial activity; digitalis intoxication; myasthenia gravis and ventricular dysrhythmia of the torsades de pointes type Precautions include the following: Congestive heart failure, hypotension, renal disease, hepatic failure; concurrent use of other antiarhythmic drugs; old age and breast-feeding.  Routes of entry: Oral: Oral absorption is the most frequent cause of intoxication. Parenteral: Intoxication after IV administration is rare but has been reported in patients treated with IV quinidine for cardiac dysrhythmia.  Absorption by route of exposure: Oral: Quinidine is almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. However, because of hepatic first-pass effect, the absolute bioavailability is about 70 to 80% of the ingested dose and may vary between patients and preparations.  The time to plasma peak concentration is 1 to 3 hours for quinidine sulfate, 3 to 6 hours for quinidine gluconate and about 6 hours for quinidine polygalacturonate.  Sustained-release quinidine is absorbed continuously over 8 to 12 hours. Parenteral: Absorption of quinidine after intramuscular injection may be erratic and unpredictable with incomplete absorption of the administered dose, probably due to precipitation of drug at the site of injection.  Other studies indicate no difference between the rate of quinidine absorption when given by intramuscular injection or oral absorption. Distribution by route of exposure: Oral: Protein binding:  About 70 to 80% of the drug is bound to plasma protein.  Plasma protein binding is decreased in patients with chronic liver disease.  Tissue:  Quinidine concentrations in liver are 10 to 30 times higher than those in plasma.  Skeletal and cardiac muscle, brain and other tissues contain intermediate amounts.  The red cell plasma partition ratio is 0.82.  Biological half-life by route of exposure: Elimination half-life:  The half-life is about 6 to 7 hours.  It is increased in chronic liver disease and in the elderly.  It does not appear to be altered in congestive heart failure or renal failure.  Metabolism: 50 to 90% of quinidine is metabolized in the liver to hydroxylated products.  Metabolites include 3-hydroxyquinidine, 2 oxoquinidinone, 0-desmethylquinidine, quinidine-N-oxide.  The principal metabolite is 3 hydroxyquinidine which exerts similar effects to quinidine and may account for part of the observed antiarrhythmic effects.  The elimination kinetics of hydroxyquinidine appear to be similar to those of quinidine.  Elimination by route of exposure Kidney: The amount excreted unchanged in urine is variable but is about 17% of an administered dose.  Up to 50% of a dose of quinidine (unchanged + metabolites) is excreted in urine within 24 hours after administration.  Renal excretion is dependent upon the pH of the urine.  Excretion varies inversely with urine pH.  Excretion is reduced in renal insufficiency and in congestive heart failure. Liver: 50 to 90% of a dose of quinidine is metabolized in the liver. Bile: Approximately 1 to 3% is excreted in the feces via the bile. Breast milk: Quinidine is excreted in breast milk.  Mode of action Toxicodynamics: Quinidine reduces the permeability of heart muscle to electrolytes (membrane stabilizer) and is a general cardiac depressant.  It has a negative inotropic effect; inhibits the spontaneous diastolic depolarization; slow conduction; lengthens the effective refractory period; and raises the electrical threshold.  This results in depression of contractility, impaired conductivity (atrioventricular and intraventricular) and decreased excitability but with possible abnormal stimulus re-entry mechanism.  Quinidine has an anticholinergic effect and peripheral vasodilator properties.  In experimental studies the following progression changes was observed: ECG: bradycardia, prolongation of the PR interval, lengthening of the QT interval, widening of the QRS with development of an idioventricular rhythm and then in ventricular standstill.  Sometimes the terminal event was ventricular fibrillation.  Blood pressure decreases progressively.  A significant decrease of blood pressure was noted with the appearance of QRS widening and blood pressure was close to zero when slow idioventricular rhythm appeared.  Electrolytes abnormalities: decrease in plasma concentrations of potassium, sodium and magnesium with the development of acidosis.  Electrolytes:  Hypokalaemia may occur and is probably related to an intracellular transport of potassium by a direct effect on cellular membrane permeability.  Neurologic symptoms:  Syncope and convulsions may represent a direct toxic effect on CNS or may be related to cerebral ischaemia due to circulatory or respiratory failure. Pharmacodynamics: Quinidine slows the rate of firing of the normal and of ectopic rhythmic foci; it raises the threshold for electrically induced arrhythmias; it protects against ventricular arrhythmias; and it prevents or terminates circus movement flutter.  Teratogenicity: Quinidine has been implicated as a cause of light cranial nerve damage to the fetus at doses much larger than those needed to treat arrhythmias.  Interactions: Several interactions have been reported.  Quinidine has a synergistic action with warfarin (decrease of prothrombin level).  Quinidine potentiates both non-depolarizing and depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. The cardiodepressant effects of other antiarrhythmic agents are increased by concurrent use of quinidine; amiodarone increases quinidine concentrations in the blood.  Quinidine concentrations are reduced by: rifampicin, anticonvulsants, nifedipine and acetazolamide.  Quinidine concentrations are increased by antacids, cimetidine, verapamil and amiodarone; the risk of quinidine toxicity is increased by terfenadine, astemizole, and thiazide and loop diuretics. Quinidine increases the plasma concentrations of propafenone and digoxin.  Main adverse effects: Numerous adverse effects during quinidine therapy have been reported.  Cardiovascular: Hypotension after IV administration; Syncope; proarrhythmic effect: \"torsades de pointes\"; and ECG: widening of QRS interval; prolongation of PR and QT intervals. CNS: Cinchonism:  headache, fever, visual disturbances, mydriasis, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting and rashes.  Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, colic have been reported.  Hepatic: Granulomatous hepatitis or hepatitis with centrilobular necrosis.  Skin: Skin rashes with drug fever and photosensitivity may result.  Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia (immunologic reaction) has been noted.  Clinical effects: Acute poisoning: Ingestion: Severity of quinidine poisoning is related to the cardiotoxic effects.  Symptoms appear usually within 2 to 4 hours and may include: cardiovascular symptoms: hypotension, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest.  ECG may show: decrease of T wave; prolongation of QT and QRS intervals; atrioventricular block; ventricular dysrhythmia (torsade de pointes).  Neurological symptoms: tinnitus, drowsiness, syncope, coma, convulsion, blurred vision and diplopia.  Respiratory symptoms: hypoventilation and apnea.  Cardiotoxicity may be enhanced if other cardiotoxic drugs have been ingested (antiarrhythmic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants). Parenteral exposure: After IV administration symptoms appear more rapidly. Chronic poisoning: Ingestion: The most relevant symptoms of chronic poisoning are: ECG disturbances; syncope due to ventricular dysrhythmia, (torsade de pointes) and cinchonism gastrointestinal disturbances  Course, prognosis, cause of death: The usual course of quinidine poisoning is dominated by the cardiovascular disturbances which usually occur within 2 to 4 first hours but may first appear as late as 12 hours after exposure (and perhaps even later after ingestion of a slow- release preparation).  Symptoms may last for 24 to 36 hours.  Patients who survive 48 hours after acute poisoning are likely to recover.  Death may result from cardiac arrest by asystole or electromechanical dissociation and, rarely, by ventricular fibrillation.  Systematic description of clinical effects: Cardiovascular: Acute:  Cardiovascular symptoms are the major features of quinidine toxicity.  Tachycardia due to anticholinergic effects is usually observed initially or in moderate intoxication.  In severe intoxication, bradycardia due to atrioventricular block may occur.  Hypotension and shock:  hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation is common. In severe intoxication, cardiogenic shock with increased central venous pressure is usually observed and is related to decreased cardiac contractility.  Cardiac arrest may occur, which may be related to electromechanical dissociation, ventricular dysrhythmia or asystole. Cardiac dysrhythmias are common and may include: atrioventricular block, idioventricular rhythm, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, torsades de pointes.  ECG changes are always present in symptomatic intoxication:  repolarization abnormalities, decreased T wave, increase of U wave, prolongation of QT and PR intervals, widening of QRS complexes (> 0.08 sec), atrioventricular block.  Syncope due to torsade de pointes may occur.  Chronic:  ECG changes with repolarization abnormalities, decreased T wave and increase of QT interval are a common feature during quinidine therapy.  Syncope is related to transient torsade de pointes and occurs in 1 to 8% of patients receiving quinidine.  The occurrence of torsade de pointes is not correlated with plasma quinidine levels but is favored by an increase in the QT interval. Respiratory: Acute:  Respiratory depression or apnea is mostly associated with severe cardiac disturbances such as shock or ventricular dysrhythmia.  Pulmonary edema with normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure following an attempted suicide has been documented.  Neurological: CNS: Acute: Drowsiness, delirium, coma and convulsions may appear without cardiac symptoms.  However, cardiac failure should always be considered when CNS symptoms appear.  Cinchonism may sometimes appear. Chronic: Cinchonism.  Delirium has been reported. Peripheral nervous system: Chronic: Quinidine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking action of some skeletal muscle relaxants and may cause the return of respiratory paralysis if it is given shortly after recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Autonomic nervous system: Acute: Quinidine has an anticholinergic effect.  However, this effect is usually limited to the vagal system. Skeletal and smooth muscle: Chronic: An increase in serum concentrations of skeletal muscle enzymes has been reported in a man treated with quinidine.  Gastrointestinal: Acute: Nausea and vomiting may occur.  Chronic:            Gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and colic) is the most frequent side effect of quinidine.  Hepatic: Chronic: Hepatotoxicity has been reported, with an increase in serum concentrations of transaminases, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, and cholestasis.  Renal: Acute: No direct nephrotoxic effect has been reported.  Acute renal failure related to cardiogenic shock may occur.  Dermatological: Chronic: Skin lesions have been attributed to the use of quinidine and include skin rash, photosensitivity and lichen planus.  Eye, ear, nose, throat: local effects: Acute: Cinchonism is rarely observed in acute poisonings.  Toxic amblyopia, scotoma and impaired color perception may occur at toxic doses. Chronic: Chronic cumulative overdose may cause cinchonism: headache, tinnitus, vertigo, mydriasis, blurred vision, diplopia, photophobia, deafness, and corneal deposits have been reported in a patient who took quinidine for two years.  Hematological: Chronic: Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia of immunologic origins have been reported.  Immunological: Chronic: Quinidine may cause several immunologic mediated reactions: thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, angioneurotic edema, skin rash, fever.  Metabolic: Acid-base disturbances: Acute: Metabolic acidosis may occur in severe intoxication with shock.  Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Acute: Hypokalemia is frequently observed.  Special risks: Pregnancy: Chronic: Quinidine has been implicated as a cause of cranial nerve damage to the fetus at doses much larger than those needed to treat arrhythmia.  In a neonate born to a woman taking quinidine throughout pregnancy, serum levels were equal to that of the mother.  The child's ECG was normal and there was no evidence of teratogenicity. Breast-feeding: Chronic: Quinidine is present in breast milk at levels slightly lower than serum levels.  The dose of quinidine received by an infant taking 1l of milk would be below therapeutic doses.  However, breast-feeding is not recommended because of potential quinidine accumulation in the immature newborn liver. /Quinidine/",

The latter is most significant in cases of severe intoxication, in which cardiogenic shock may be a cause of death. Cautious use of fluids is usually effective in managing hypotension due to vasodilating or adrenergic blocking agents /including quinidine/. If blood pressure does not respond to fluids, vasoconstrictor drugs such as norepinephrine or dopamine should be used. ... Differentiating hypotension caused by vasodilation from that caused by myocardial depression and selecting appropriate therapy require measurement of cardiac output. Thus placement of a pulmonary arterial catheter is desirable. If cardiac output is low and cardiac filling pressure is also low, more fluids are necessary. If cardiac output is low despite adequate filling pressures, inotropic agents should be administered. Animal studies have shown isoproterenol to be most effective in reversing disopyramide-induced myocardial depression. Dobutamine should also be considered. If cardiac output is adequate but vascular resistance is low, vasopressors should be administered. ... In severe cases of quinidine poisoning with low-output shock due to myocardial depression, inotropic drugs may not improve contractility. Yet, in contrast to the situation of cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction, if the patient can be supported for several hours until the intoxicating drug can be eliminated, myocardial function will return to normal. Thus, drug-induced cardiogenic shock is an ideal situation for use of extracorporeal circulatory assistance techniques. /Quinidine/",

Therefore iv lines, oxygen, and cardiac monitoring are first priorities. Convulsions are often responsive to diazepam. Failure to respond to the usual anticonvulsant drugs is an indication to check serum electrolytes (particularly calcium) and glucose levels. Respiratory distress may result from either respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, or the development of the adult respiratory distress syndrome. In patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, pulmonary edema may result from depressed myocardial contractility. The usual measures of emesis/lavage, activated charcoal, and cathartics within the first several hours (longer if sustained-release preparations are ingested) are indicated. Repeated doses of activated charcoal (every 3 to 4 hr) may enhance the elimination of quinidine trapped in the acid media of the stomach. Although renal excretion of unmetabolized quinidine increases in acid urine, the usefulness of acid diuresis has not been clinically evaluated. Dialysis does not remove a clinically significant amount of quinidine, because of the high degree of protein binding, and should be used only in the presence of renal failure. Hemoperfusion may be useful if hepatic failure reduces metabolism. Glucagon has a positive inotropic effect in dogs, but its clinical efficacy has not been evaluated. Bretylium antagonizes quinidine-induced toxic effects on ventricular fibers, but it may enhance quinidine-induced reduction in atrioventricular conduction.Hypotension should be treated initially with fluids, pneumatic trousers, and, if required, vasopressors. Both isoproterenol and norepinephrine have been used successfully, and a resistant case has responded to the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Persistent hypotension should be managed with a pulmonary catheter and arterial lines in coronary care unit. Treat ventricular dysrhythmias with class IB drugs (lidocaine, phenytoin), and avoid class IA drugs (procainamide, isopyramide). Bretylium should be used with caution because of synergistic atrioventricular nodal suppression. When atypical ventricular tachycardia presents, the goal is to reduce the QT interval. Isoproterenol infusion, 2 to 8 ug/min, may be effective, but usually overdrive pacing (120 to 140/min) is necessary. Lidocaine and procainamide are not effective and may be deleterious. Be sure to correct electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia). /Quinidine/",

Cytochrome p450 metabolism is affected by genetic polymorphisms and by xenobiotic interactions in an isozyme specific fashion. Little is known concerning the isozyme selectivity of amphetamine metabolism. Quinidine selectively inhibits the debrisoquine specific isozyme (p450db) which displays genetic polymorphism in ... rats. The effect of quinidine on themetabolism of amphetamine to p-hydroxyamphetamine in vivo is reported. At 0 hr male Lewis rats received (orally): no treatment, 80 mg quinidine/kg in 50% ethanol, or 50% ethanol, followed at 2 hr by 15 mg d-amphetamine sulfate/kg (orally). Urine specimens were collected and pooled at 0, 24, and 48 hr. Amphetamine and p-hydroxyamphetamine concentrations were determined using a new GC/MS method for simultaneous quantitation. The ethanol vehicle control (50% ethanol) had no significant effect on amphetamine metabolism. Quinidine pretreatment (80 mg quinidine/kg in 50% ethanol) resulted in a significant decrease in the excretion of p-hydroxyamphetamine at 24 and 48 hr to 7.2 and 24.1% of the vehicle control levels, respectively, accompanied by a significant increase in amphetamine excretion between 24 and 48 hr to 542% of the control. These data show that quinidine inhibits in vivo metabolism of amphetamine in rats and suggest that amphetamine metabolism may, in part, be mediated by an isozyme of cytochome p450 which displays genetic polymorphism. The inhibition of amphetamine metabolism results in an increased ratio of parent drug to metabolite concentration (metabolic ratio) in the urine, which mimics the effect of genetic polymorphisms. /Quinidine/",

Considerable evidence has accumulated about the mechanism of action of quinine/quinidine induced antibodies but less is known about the effect of heparin. Although there is controversy, it is likely that the action of quinine/quinidine induced antibodies follows a loose association between drug and platelet with antibodies acting independently of the Fc receptor. There is strong evidence that the complex of glycoprotein Ib and glycoprotein IX, absent in the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, provides the binding site for quinine/quinidine dependent antibodies. It also appears that the two glycoproteins must be present in complex form for antibody binding to occur. There is some heterogeneity of quinine/quinidine dependent antibodies since there are reports of a proportion of patient antibodies reacting with other membrane determinants or acting independently of the drug. /Quinidine/",

A major clinical advantage of formoterol over other inhaled beta-agonists is its rapid onset of action (2-3 minutes), which is at least as fast as [salbutamol], combined with a long duration of action (12 hours) - for this reason, treatment guidelines for asthma recommend its use as both a reliever and maintenance medication. It is available as a single-entity product and in several formulations in combination with both inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting muscarinic antagonists.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Following a single dose of 10 mcg, Cmax and AUC were 22 pmol/L and 81 pmol.h/L, respectively. In asthmatic adult patients, Tmax ranged from 0.58 to 1.97 hours. Following single-dose administration of 10mcg, Cmax and AUC0-12h were 22 pmol/L and 125 pmol.h/L, respectively; following multiple-dose administration of 10 mcg, Cmax and AUC0-12h were 41 pmol/L and 226 pmol.h/L, respectively.

Minor pathways involve sulfate conjugation of formoterol and deformylation followed by sulfate conjugation. The most prominent pathway involves direct conjugation at the phenolic hydroxyl group. The second major pathway involves O-demethylation followed by conjugation at the phenolic 2'-hydroxyl group. Four cytochrome P450 isozymes (CYP2D6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP2A6) are involved in the O-demethylation of formoterol. Formoterol did not inhibit CYP450 enzymes at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Some patients may be deficient in CYP2D6 or 2C19 or both. Whether a deficiency in one or both of these isozymes results in elevated systemic exposure to formoterol or systemic adverse effects has not been adequately explored.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Beta<sub>2</sub> receptors are found predominantly in bronchial smooth muscle (with a relatively minor amount found in cardiac tissue) whereas beta<sub>1</sub> receptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors found in the heart - for this reason, selectivity for beta<sub>2</sub> receptors is desirable in the treatment of pulmonary diseases such as COPD and asthma. Formoterol has demonstrated an approximately 200-fold greater activity at beta<sub>2</sub> receptors over beta<sub>1</sub> receptors.  On a molecular level, activation of beta receptors by agonists like formoterol stimulates intracellular adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increased levels of cAMP in bronchial smooth muscle tissue result in relaxation of these muscles and subsequent dilation of the airways, as well as inhibition of the release of hypersensitivity mediators (e.g. histamine, leukotrienes) from culprit cells, especially mast cells.",

It is in a class of medications called long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs). LABAs are bronchodilators. Bronchodilators help open the airways in the lungs. Formoterol is taken by inhalation (breathing it in). It has been used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment. For information about inhaled corticosteroids, see the MotherToBaby fact sheet at https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/inhaled-corticosteroids-icss-pregnancy/. Some brand names of formoterol are Foradil\u00ae, Perforomist\u00ae, and Brovana\u00ae. Formoterol can also be found in some combination medications such as Symbicort\u00ae and Dulera\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take this medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy. Asthma that is not well-controlled can increase risks to a pregnancy. For more information, see our fact sheet on asthma here https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/asthma-and-pregnancy/.",

Available information from animal studies and human case reports does not suggest an increased chance of birth defects when formoterol is used in pregnancy.A study on the use of LABAs as a group reported an increased chance for heart defects when used in the first trimester. However, it is not known if the medication, the condition being treated, or other factors caused the reported birth defects.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.0X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates formoterol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase formoterol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, formoterol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 430. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.0X10-23 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, formoterol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa1 (amine) and pKa2 (phenol) of formoterol are 7.9 and 9.2, respectively, indicating that this compound will exist primarily in the protonated form below pH 7 and in its zwitterion form in the pH range of 7 to 9. Cations generally adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Biodegradation data for soil or water were not available. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 0.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that may hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to formoterol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where formoterol is produced or used. The general population are exposed to formoterol via inhalation of pharmaceutical products containing formoterol. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

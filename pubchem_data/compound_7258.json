PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The mineralization of these chlorinated aromatic substrates to carbon dioxide and free chloride has been studied as a function of iron (2+)+ hydrogen peroxide and perchloric acid. Increasing the concentration of iron (2+)+ hydrogen peroxide enhances the decomposition process, while an increase in the concentration of perchloric acid, inhibits the reaction. The presence of iron (3+) alone without any iron (2+) with hydrogen peroxide has no effect on the degradation of the chlorophenols. In all cases, the stoichiometric quantity of free chloride was obtained at the completion of the decomposition reaction; but the rates of disappearance of the chlorophenol and of the formation of the chloride are not similar.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

To investigate the relation between metabolism and toxicity of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB), the biotransformation, tissue distribution, blood kinetics, and excretion at three different oral dose levels (5, 50 and 250 mg/kg) of the radiolabelled compound were investigated in the male Wistar rat. A toxic dose level (250 mg/kg...) was included. ... The concentration of parent chemical was essentially constant during 3 and 6 hr for the mid- and high-dose level respectively, and then declined. 1,2-DCB could only be detected in blood in the first 2 hr after administration of the 5-mg/kg dose. The major route of biotransformation was via the glutathione pathway and 60% of the urinary metabolites were mercapturic acids. In addition, the major metabolites in bile were conjugates of glutathione. Other major metabolites in urine were the sulfate conjugates of 2,3- and 3,4-dichlorophenol (DCP). No significant differences in metabolic profiles were observed between the different doses. Induction with phenobarbital resulted in the increased excretion of sulfate conjugates (30% in the induced rat, 20% in the control rat), mainly the conjugate of 3,4-DCP...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Exposure to this crystalline substance may occur from dermal contact or inhalation at sites where it is used as a chemical intermediate. Effects from exposure include burning of the skin, headache, dizziness, cyanosis, and death from cardiac or respiratory failure. Personnel handling 3,4-dichlorophenol should wear protective clothing, gloves, boots, goggles, and an approved dust respirator. In emergency situations, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and structural firefighter's protective clothing. Remove and isolate contaminated clothing at the site. In case of contact with 3,4-dichlorophenol, immediately flush skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and wash affected areas of the skin with soap and water. 3,4-Dichlorophenol does not ignite easily, but it can burn, producing irritating and poisonous gases. For small fires involving 3,4-dichlorophenol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, or standard foam, and for large fires, use water spray, fog, or standard foam. Dike runoff from fire control water if necessary to keep it from entering water sources or sewers where it may cause pollution. 3,4-Dichlorophenol may be shipped via air, rail, road, or water in containers bearing the label, \"Keep away from food.\" Small spills of 3,4-dichlorophenol solution may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills should be contained in pits, or other holding areas that are sealed with an impermeable flexible membrane liner. Solids should be covered with a plastic sheet. Spills of 3,4-dichlorophenol in water may be trapped at the bottom with sand bag barriers, activated charcoal applied, and trapped material removed with suction hoses, mechanical dredges, or lifts. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

Most of these studies (case-control and cohort studies) have been described and reviewed in several publications by IARC (1979, 1986, 1987). Equivocal relationships between chlorophenols and cases of soft tissue sarcoma, malignant lymphoma (Hodgkins disease and non-Hodgkins lymphoma), nasal and nasopharyngeal cancer and lung cancer have been reported.

It may occur naturally in soil through direct synthesis by soil fungi or fungi-derived enzymes utilizing humic phenols. Chlorophenols may be released into the environment through burning of biomass during forest fires. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.00371 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,4-dichlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,4-dichlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 2 days. 3,4-Dichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3,4-dichlorophenol is expected to have low mobility based upon a Koc of 860. The pKa of 3,4-dichlorophenol is 8.63, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.77X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. 3,4-Dichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure of 0.00371 mm Hg. 3,4-Dichlorophenol exhibits far ranging biodegradation rates in soil from, from half-lives of 18 days an acidic sandy loam, 3 days in basic sandy silt loam, and 160 days in a clay loam soil, suggesting that biodegradation in soil is probably affected by many factors. If released into water, 3,4-dichlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 98 and 720 days, respectively. A BCF range of 22 to 84 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3,4-dichlorophenol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,4-dichlorophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 3,4-dichlorophenol via ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization of 3,4-dichlorophenol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.77X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(6). 3,4-Dichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.00371 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(7). 3,4-Dichlorophenol exhibits far ranging biodegradation rates in soil from, from half-lives of 18 days an acidic sandy loam, 3 days in basic sandy silt loam(8), and 160 days in a clay loam soil(9), suggesting that biodegradation in soil is probably affected by many factors(SRC).",

The soil around the treatment basins contained up to 70 mg chlorophenols/kg and that in the storage area for treated lumber up to 6 mg/kg. Contamination extended to a depth of at least 2 m near the treatment basins. Surface water inside the sawmill area contained the same chlorophenols as those used in wood preservation, plus some additional isomers. The ground water and lake water around the sawmill areas were contaminated. The fate of different chlorophenols in soil is probably affected by many factors, such as the water solubility of each chlorophenol, pH of the soil, rainfall, soil organic matter content, type and particle size of the soil, biological and photodegradation and the evaporation of each chlorophenol(1).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.77X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 98 days and 720 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), a measured BCF range of 22-84(6), and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. A 0% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(6) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 3,4-dichlorophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 2 days(SRC), calculated from its estimated rate constant of 6.99X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 3,4-Dichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 2 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 3,4-Dichlorophenol undergoes direct photolysis and hydrolysis in water upon UV irradiation at wavelengths greater than 280 nm, producing 4-chlororesorcinol via replacement of the chlorine in the 3 position on the ring with a hydroxyl group(2). 3,4-Dichlorophenol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). 3,4-Dichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A rapid incr in venous capacitance in conjunction with a brisk natriuresis reduces left ventricular filling pressures and thereby rapidly relieves pulmonary edema. Loop diuretics also are widely used for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure when diminution of extracellular fluid volume is desirable to minimize venous and pulmonary congestion. Diuretics are widely used for the treatment of hypertension, and controlled clinical trials demonstrating reduced morbidity and mortality have been conducted with Na+-Cl- symport (thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics), but not Na+-K+-2Cl- symport, inhibitors. Nonetheless, Na+-K+-2Cl- symport inhibitors appear to lower blood pressure as effectively as Na+-Cl- symport inhibitors while causing smaller perturbations in the lipid profile. /Loop diuretics/"

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

It is not known whether ethacrynic acid crosses the placenta or is distributed into milk in humans. ... Approx 30-65% of an IV dose of ethacrynate sodium is secreted by the proximal renal tubules and is excreted in urine; approx 35-40% is excreted in bile, partially as the cysteine conjugate. In dogs, approx 30-40% of the drug excreted in urine is unchanged, 20-30% is the cysteine conjugate, and 33-40% is an unstable, unidentified compound.

Because this inhibition occurred with lower concns of ethacrynic acid in the presence of cysteine, it has been proposed that the ethacrynate-cysteine metabolite is the most active form of the drug. The drug increases potassium excretion in the distal renal tubule. Ethacrynic acid does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase, and it is not an aldosterone antagonist. Aldosterone secretion may incr during therapy with the drug and may contribute to the hypokalemia caused by ethacrynic acid.",

Use absorbent paper dampened with 60-70% ethanol to pick up any remaining material. Seal the absorbent paper, and any of your clothes, which may be contaminated, in a vapor-tight plastic bag for eventual disposal. Solvent wash all contaminated surfaces with 60-70% ethanol followed by washing with a soap and water solution. Do not reenter the contaminated area until the Safety Officer (or other responsible person) has verified that the area has been properly cleaned.",

Membrane whorls also were common within mitochondria of such cells. The endoplasmic reticulum of some spiral ganglion cells was dilated. The major cytologic changes were found in the stria vascularis of the cochlea and dark cell areas of the vestibular system. There was marked dilatation of the intercellular fluid spaces, consistent with the biochemical observation that loop diuretics interfere first with enzyme systems responsible for fluid transport within the inner ear.",

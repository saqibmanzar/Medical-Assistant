PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

On the eye, dimethyl sulfate produces toxic effects similar to those of methanol and it is probable that its toxicity is in part a direct result of the dissolved methanol moiety of the molecule as well as being a result of alkylation reactions.

Doses of 5 mg/kg MNU led to elevated urinary levels of 7-MA (144 ng) compared to controls (26 ng). Other methylating agents, such as dimethylnitrosamine, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and dimethyl sulfate, also provided urinary 7-MA. To determine the fate of injected 7-MA, the administration of 2 ug 7-[3H-methyl]adenine led to an 80% recovery of radioactivity in the urine, almost all of it during the first 24 hr.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

While both methylate the N7 position of guanine heavily, only MAM strongly methylates the O(6) position of guanine. ... The relative effectiveness and specificity of MAM and DMS in bacterial assays /were evaluated/ for the induction of point mutations and the formation of chromosomal duplications by genetic recombination. Salmonella typhimurium strain TS1121 was used to measure the formation of genetic duplications on the basis of the aroC321 allele and mutations by reversion of the hisG46 allele. Specific base pair substitutions and frameshift mutations were measured in a reversion assay based on lacZ alleles of Escherichia coli. The results show MAM to be the more potent mutagen and DMS the stronger recombinagen in the Salmonella assay. In the lacZ assay DMS induced several classes of base pair substitutions (GC to AT transitions, GC to TA transversions and AT to TA transversions), as well as lower frequencies of +1, -1 and -2 frameshift mutations. The activity of MAM as a base pair substitution mutagen was more specific than that of DMS, inducing only GC to AT transitions. It also induced +G, -G, -A and -CG frameshift mutations, though more weakly than it induced GC to AT transitions. Long known as a base pair substitution mutagen, the induction of frameshifts by MAM was unexpected. ....",

Do not use open burning (e.g., as a boiler fuel) or evaporation for waste disposal. For incineration, dimethyl sulfate should be dissolved in a combustible solvent and sprayed into a furnace with an afterburner and an alkali scrubber. Dimethyl sulfate may be decomposed by adding a dilute alkaline solution; the mixture should be stirred and then allowed to settle. The resulting solution is then neutralized by acid or alkali as appropriate and drained into a sewer. When rapid decomposition is needed the waste may be warmed. It may also be adsorbed on vermiculite, packed in drums, buried and covered immediately.",

During the kinetic study of the destruction process, the determination of remaining concentrations of the alkylating agents was performed by the derivatization of p-nitrophenoxide to p-nitroanisole and p-nitrophenetole, which were separated by high performance liquid chromatography. The mutagenic activity of the destruction products was evaluated by the Ames test using Salmonella tester strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA102. The kinetics of destruction in every case followed a time-dependent exponential relationship. Solutions of 1 M Na2S2O3 showed the highest capacity for destruction of the four alkylating agents, half-lives of DMS, DES, MMS, and EMS being 0.14 min, 1.26 min, 0.60 min, and 5.26 min, respectively. No mutagenic activity was detected following complete destruction in 1 M Na2S2O3.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The prophylactic use of steroids after exposure, but before any signs and symptoms appear, may be of value in reducing pulmonary damage by dimethyl sulfate. An early chest X-ray may be useful for comparison with a later film in the event of the development of pulmonary edema. Oral or aerosol bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol) may be of value if there is bronchospasm. Oxygen and humidification are the main lines of treatment for mild pulmonary edema; diuretics, opiates, and theophyllines do not have a role, since the condition is exudative rather than transudative. In extreme cases, intermittent positive-pressure ventilation may be necessary ...",

Genital and mucous membrane lesions have been reported following direct contact, generally with the vapor. Systemic effects can include convulsions, delirium, coma, analgesia, pyrexia, pulmonary edema, delayed renal and hepatic failure, and cardiac damage. ..."

Following DMS exposure, nasal respiratory and olfactory mucosa and lung tissue were removed and DNA was isolated for the analysis of methylated purines. DMS vapor uptake was complex and related to exposure concentration; clearance appeared to increase with increasing DMS concentrations between 0.5 and 8 ppm. Plethysmorgraphic measurements correlated with the time-dependent disappearance of dimethyl sulfate from a closed exposure apparatus. Above an initial DMS concentration of 8 ppm, sensory irritancy apparently altered normal respiratory parameters, clearance, and regional DNA methylation. DMS-dependent N7-methylguanine formation in DNA isolated from nasal respiratory mucosa was detectable 30 min following a 20-min exposure to an initial DMS concentration of 1 ppm. DMS-dependent methylation of DNA, as evidenced by N7-methylguanine and N3-methyladenine formation, showed concentration-response relationships in all tissues examined and was correlated with vapor uptake. DNA adduct formation showed regional differences characteristic of the absorption of a water-soluble vapor; methylation was greatest in DNA isolated from respiratory mucosa, less in olfactory, and little in lung. Repair of N7-methylguanine did not appear to be significantly different between nasal respiratory and olfactory tissues. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.677 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethyl sulfate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethyl sulfate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 82 days. Vapor-phase dimethyl sulfate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with water (estimated atmospheric lifetime of >2 days). Dimethyl sulfate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dimethyl sulfate is expected to hydrolyze in moist soils. Adsorption and volatilization from soil are not expected to be important fate processes because of hydrolysis. If released into water, dimethyl sulfate is expected to hydrolyze with a half-life of 1.15 hours; methanol and sulfuric acid have been identified as hydrolysis products. Volatilization, adsorption to suspended solids and sediments, biodegradation, and bioconcentration are not expected to be important fate processes in aquatic systems because of hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to dimethyl sulfate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyl sulfate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dimethyl sulfate via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase dimethyl sulfate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 84 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Vapor-phase dimethyl sulfate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with water (estimated atmospheric lifetime of >2 days)(4). Dimethyl sulfate is likely to become incorporated into fog and cloudwater, in which case it will hydrolyze to monomethyl hydrogen sulfate (and finally sulfuric acid) and methanol, with a half-life on the order of 30 to 60 min(4). Dimethyl sulfate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 84 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Experimental rate constants for the gas-phase reactions of dimethyl sulfate with ozone, <1.4X10-21 cu cm/molecule-sec; ammonia, <1.5X10-21 cu cm/molecule-sec; and water, <1.1X10-23 cu cm/molecule-sec translate to atmospheric lifetimes of >33 yr, >8 yr, and >2 days, respectively(2). A measured hydrolysis rate constant of 1.66X10-4/sec for dimethyl sulfate in water at 25 \u00b0C(3) corresponding to a half-life of 1.1 hrs at pH 7(SRC). The reaction is catalyzed under both acidic and basic conditions forming sulfuric acid and free methanol at pHs <7(4). The first methyl group is removed much more rapidly than the second with hydrolysis of the dimethyl sulfate being complete in a 24 hr period in water, dilute acid, or dilute base; the monomethyl species persists over a period of several weeks(5). The compound is hydrolyzed slowly in cold water(6). Dimethyl sulfate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

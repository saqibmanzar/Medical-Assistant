When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Diethylstilbesterol was administered as a positive control (10 ug/kg bw). Dams were observed for signs of toxicity and body weights were recorded during gestation. The percent pregnant, number of viable fetuses per litter, number of resorption sites, and dead in utero per litter were recorded and expressed as a percent of the control value. No effects on maternal body weight were observed and no sign of toxicity were reported.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.1X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-undecanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-undecanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days. If released to soil, 2-undecanone is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 280. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.36X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Undecanone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 2-undecanone is expected to biodegrade under aerobic conditions in the soil and water. If released into water, 2-undecanone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 11 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 28 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 2-undecanone may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-undecanone is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-undecanone via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing 2-undecanone.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

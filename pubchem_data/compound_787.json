For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

It should be stored below 10 \u00b0C [Bailar, 1973, vol. 2, p. 272]. Explosive reaction with strong oxidizers (chromium trioxide, potassium dichromate) or powdered zinc upon heat. Reaction with zinc or calcium produces explosive bishydroxylamides. It ignites on contact with cupric sulfate, alkali metals (sodium, potassium), oxidants (e.g., barium oxide, barium peroxide, lead dioxide, potassium permanganate, chlorine), phosphorus trichloride and pentachloride. It reacts vigorously with hypochlorites, pyridine, carbonyls [Sax, 9th ed., 1996, p. 1875]. On contact with organic materials in thin layer (e.g., crystals on filter paper), it may ignite spontaneously in air. It explodes when heated above 70 \u00b0C [Brauer, 1963, vol. 1, p. 502]. During a distillation process, an explosion occurred. Potassium hydroxide is thought to be involved in the explosion. Employees in the plant complained of chest pains and suffered chemical burns. Five people were killed by the explosion.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 53 mm Hg at 32 \u00b0C indicates hydroxylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase hydroxylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hours. If released to soil, hydroxylamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 14. The pKa of hydroxyamine is 5.94, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process for the neutral species based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole, and the protonated form will not volatilize. Hydroxylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, hydroxylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since the estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species is very low; this compound will partially exist as a cation in waters and cations do not volatilize. Abiotic degradation of hydroxylamine by photochemically produced peroxy radicals is an important environmental fate process in surface waters. The half-life of this reaction has been measured at about 2 hours. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to hydroxylamine may occur through inhalation of dust particles and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hydroxylamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

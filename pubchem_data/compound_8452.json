When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this peppermint-smelling, water-white liquid may occur from its production and use as an intermediate for pharmaceuticals, biologicals, insecticides, and rubber chemicals. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the skin and eyes, CNS depression, and suffocation.  In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear protective clothing and a positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus.  If contact should occur, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing and shoes should be removed and isolated at the site.  Cyclopentanone may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames (flash point: 87 \u00b0F, closed cup), and is dangerously reactive with oxidizing materials.  Its heavier-than-air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back, or accumulate to explosive concentrations in confined spaces such as sewers. Also, containers of this substance may explode in the heat of a fire.  For fires involving cyclopentanone, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, fog, or alcohol-resistant foam. Isolate the area for 1/2 mile in all directions if a tank, rail car, or tank truck is involved in the fire. For small spills of cyclopentanone, take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. Large spills should first be diked far ahead of the spill.",

Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out. For petroleum crude oil, do not spray water directly into a breached tank car. This can lead to a dangerous boil over. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks in direct contact with flames. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2024)",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Male Wistar rats exposed intermittently to cyclopentanone vapor at 50, 100 or 300 ppm 6 hr/day 5 days per wk for 1-15 wk showed brain and perirenal fat solvent concentrations which correlated to the exposure although they decreased at the later /stages of/ the experiment. Cyclopentanone caused almost no effects on liver drug metabolizing enzymes or aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, while an early increase in the kidney 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase was found after 1 wk without a concomitant increase in the cytochrome p450 content. This effect was abolished later so that an enhancement was found only at the highest exposure level after 15 wk. Postmitochondrial fractions isolated from liver of exposed animals metabolized cyclopentanone more actively than controls after 15 wk.",

Cyclopentanone is also released to the environment via effluents from the manufacture and use of coal-derived liquid fuels and the disposal of coal liquefication and gasification waste byproducts. Cyclopentanone is not expected to undergo hydrolysis or photolysis in the environment. Limited data suggests that cyclopentanone should biodegrade rapidly upon acclimation in soil and water. A low estimated Koc indicates cyclopentanone should have a very high mobility in soil. In aquatic systems, it should not partition from the water column to organic matter in sediments and suspended solids, nor should it bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. A Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C suggests that the volatilization of cyclopentanone from natural waters will be an important fate process. Volatilization half-lives from a model river and a model pond, the latter considers the effect of adsorption, have been estimated to be about 3.5 and 40 days, respectively. Based on its vapor pressure, cyclopentanone should evaporate from dry surfaces, especially when present in high concn such as in spill situations. Cyclopentanone is expected to exist entirely in the vapor phase in ambient air. Vapor phase reactions with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere have been shown to be important (half-life of 5.5 days). The most probable human exposures to cyclopentanone would be occupational exposure, which may occur through dermal contact or inhalation at places where it is produced or used. Atmospheric workplace exposures have been documented. Non-occupational exposures are likely to occur among populations with contaminated drinking water supplies or from the ingestion of certain foods. (SRC)",

An estimated Koc of 30(1) indicates cyclopentanone should have a very high mobility in soil(4). A Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(5) suggests volatilization of cyclopentanone from moist soils may be an important fate process(1). Based on a vapor pressure of 11.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6), cyclopentanone should evaporate from dry surfaces, especially when present in high concn such as in spill situations(SRC).",

A single 5-day BOD screening test, which utilized activated sludge for inocula, suggests that cyclopentanone will biodegrade rapidly upon acclimation in natural waters(3). An estimated log bioconcentration factor (log BCF) of -0.05(1) indicates cyclopentanone should not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC). An estimated Koc of 30(1) indicates cyclopentanone should not partition from the water column to organic matter contained in sediments and suspended solids(SRC). A Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(4) indicates that volatilization of cyclopentanone from natural bodies of water should be an important fate process(1). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river has been estimated to be 3.5 days(1,SRC). The volatilization half-life from an model pond, which considers the effect of adsorption, has been estimated to be about 40 days(5,SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

These compounds have not shown genotoxicity, and toxicology studies (including cancer bioassays) with PFOS and related sulfonamides have not shown bladder effects, but repeat-exposure data was not available for POSF. To further study the association of exposure to bladder cancer, we investigated ... bladder cancer incidence in workers. ... Because of high survivorship, living members (N = 1895) of the study were contacted by mail to answer a questionnaire about bladder cancer, and 74% participated. Validation occurred by medical record or death certificate for those original members deceased (N = 188). Incidence of bladder cancer was compared to expected based on NCI SEER data. Results: 11 bladder cancers were identified. The Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) for the entire cohort was 1.3 (95% CI 0.6 +/- 2.3). The SIR for ever working and working for more than one year in a high exposed job were 1.7 (95% CI 0.6 +/- 3.8) and 1.1 (95% CI 0.2 +/- 3.3), respectively. These studies do not support the hypothesis that the excess risk of bladder cancer initially reported was due to exposure to POSF-related materials or PFOS.",

Exposure to PFOS was estimated with work history records and weighted with biological monitoring data. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated using U.S. population-based rates as a reference. Bladder cancer risk within the cohort was evaluated using Poisson regression by cumulative PFOS exposure. Questionnaires were returned by 1,400 of the 1895 cohort members presumed alive. Eleven cases of primary bladder cancer were identified from the surveys (n = 6) and death certificates (n = 5). The SIRs were 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64-2.29) for the entire cohort and 1.74 (95% CI = 0.64-3.79) for those ever working in a high exposed job. Compared with employees in the lowest cumulative exposure category, the relative risk of bladder cancer was 0.83 (95% CI = 0.15-4.65), 1.92 (95% CI = 0.30-12.06), and 1.52 (95% CI = 0.21-10.99). ... /Perfluorooctane sulfonate, metabolite/",

The age- and sex-adjusted expected number of episodes of care was calculated from the company's U.S. manufacturing workforce. For a priori interests, the observed to expected episodes of care ratios were comparable for fluorochemical and film plant employees for liver tumors or diseases, bladder cancer, thyroid and lipid metabolism disorders, and reproductive, pregnancy, and perinatal disorders and higher for biliary tract disorders and cystitis recurrence.

The mean serum PFOS and PFOA concentrations for 263 Decatur employees were 1.32 parts per million (ppm; geometric mean 0.91, range 0.06-10.06 ppm) and 1.78 ppm (geometric mean 1.13, range 0.04-12.70 ppm), respectively. Mean concentrations were approximately 50% lower among 255 Antwerp workers. Adjusting for potential confounding factors, there were no substantial changes in hematological, lipid, hepatic, thyroid, or urinary parameters consistent with the known toxicological effects of PFOS or PFOA in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses of the workers' measured serum fluorochemical concentrations. /Perfluorooctane sulfonate, metabolite/",

Freshwater fish species, namely carp, snakehead, and catfish, were collected in Japan, Vietnam, India, Malaysia, and Thailand, and 10 PFSs, including perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate, were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. PFSs in carp in Tokyo were more concentrated in kidneys (sum of 10 PFSs = 257 +/- 95 ng/g wet weight [ww]) and livers (119 +/- 36 ng/g ww) than in ovaries (43 +/- 2 ng/g ww) and muscles (24 +/- 17 ng/g ww). Concentrations of PFOS and its precursor, perfluorooctane sulfonamide, in livers of carp and in waters in Tokyo showed a dramatic decrease during the last decade, probably because of 3 M's phasing-out of the manufacture of perfluorooctanesulfonyl-fluoride-based products in 2000. In contrast, continuing contamination by long-chain perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs) with > or =9 fluorinated carbons was seen in multiple media, suggesting that these compounds continue to be emitted. PFS concentrations in freshwater fish species in tropical Asian countries were generally lower than those in developed countries, such as Japan, e.g., for PFOS in muscle, Vietnam < 0.05-0.3 ng/g ww; India < 0.05-0.2 ng/g ww; Malaysia < 0.05-0.2 ng/g ww; Thailand < 0.05 ng/g ww; and Japan (Tokyo) = 5.1-22 ng/g ww. Daily intake of short-chain PFCAs with < or =8 fluorinated carbons from freshwater fish species in Japan was approximately one order of magnitude lower than that from drinking water, whereas daily intake of PFOS and long-chain PFCAs with > or =9 fluorinated carbons from freshwater fish species was comparable with or greater than that from drinking water. Because the risk posed by exposure to these compounds through intake of fish species is a matter of concern, we recommend the continued monitoring of PFS levels in Asian developing countries.  /Perfluorinated surfactants/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride is not expected to react with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals or be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3.9X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 68 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation data in soil or in water were not available. If released into water, perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.5 hours and 8.9 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 845 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 5200 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride and perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride polymers ultimately degrade to perfluorooctane sulfonate. Occupational exposure to perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride is produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 68 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.5 hours and 8.9 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 845 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 5200(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 7.84(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(2012, SRC). Perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the presence of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride and perfluorooctylsulfonyl fluoride polymers ultimately degrade to perfluorooctane sulfonate(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

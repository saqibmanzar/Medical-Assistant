When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Median survival time was 375 days. Skin tumors were found in six males (one with a squamous cell carcinoma and five with squamous papillomas) (p= 0.04). In a vehicle control group of 150 mice, ten developed skin papillomas and one a carcinoma. Because the 4-vinylcyclohexene used in ... this study may have been contaminated with a minute amount of the hydrogen peroxide formed by autooxidation, a further study was carried out using 'oxygen-free material'. In this experiment, one-fifth of the dose used in the previous study (9 mg in 0.1 ml of a 10% solution in benzene) was applied thrice weekly for life to 30 male Swiss ICR/Ha mice. The median survival time was 565 days; no carcinogenic effect was observed.",

The incidences of uncommon ovarian neoplasms were markedly increased (p< 0.01) in both groups of dosed female mice (mixed tumor, benign: 0/49; 25/48, 52%; 11/47, 23%; granulosa cell tumor: 1/49, 2%; 9/48, 19%; 11/47, 23%; granulosa cell tumor or carcinoma [combined]: 1/49, 2%; 10/48, 21%; 13/47, 28%). In addition, a slight increase in the incidence of adrenal gland adenomas in high dose females was observed (0/50; 3/39, 6%; 4/48, 8%). The extensive mortality seen in the high dose male mice confounded interpretation of the increased incidences of malignant lymphomas and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) of the lung seen in these animals surviving to the end of the study (malignant lymphomas: 3/37, 8%; 5/39, 13%; 4/7, 57%; alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas [combined]: 3/37, 8%; 9/39, 23%; 3/7, 43%). ... Under these conditions, the 2 year gavage studies of 4-vinylcyclohexene in ... male mice were considered inadequate studies of carcinogenicity because of extensive and early mortality at the high dose or at both doses and the lack of conclusive evidence of a carcinogenic effect. There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of 4-vinylcyclohexene for female mice, as shown by markedly increased incidences of uncommon ovarian neoplasms at both doses. In addition, the increased incidence of adrenal gland adenomas in high dose female mice may have been related to the administration of 4-vinylcyclohexene.",

VCH was administered to the animals by gavage in corn oil at doses of 0, 100, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day. Exposure to VCH for 14 wks did not significantly affect measures of reproductive competence. including initial fertility, mean number of litters/pair, live litter size, the proportion of pups born alive, or adjusted live pup weight. Absolute live pup weight was decreased (males & sexes combined) at the high dose. F0 feed & water consumption were not adversely affected by treatment. At necropsy, the F0 females in the high-dose group had slightly decreased body weight. VCH did not adversely affect preweaning growth or survival in the F1 generation. High-dose (500 mg/kg/day VCH) males, selected on postnatal day 21 for inclusion in Task 4, had decreased body weight throughout Task 4 to scheduled necropsy. F1 females selected from the high-dose group for inclusion in Task 4 had decreased body weight beginning at 74+/-10 days of age through Task 4 to necropsy. There was no effect of VCH treatment on feed or water consumption. VCH had no effect on the reproductive competence of the F1 generation; adjusted live pup weight for females & the sexes combined was slightly but significantly depressed in the VCH-treated litters. At necropsy, relative, but not absolute, liver weight (males & females) & sperm motility were increased in the VCH-treated group; testicular spermatid count was decreased by VCH treatment. The number of primordial, growing, & antral oocytes was significantly reduced in VCH-treated females. VCH at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day had no significant adverse effect on reproductive competence in either the F0 or F1 generation. For the F1 males & females, this was in spite of a slight but significant reduction in spermatid head count (83% of control) & ovarian follicles (46-67% of control), respectively. F0 females receiving 500 mg/kg/day exhibited slight general toxicity manifested as an 8% decr in body weight after 18 wks treatment. F1 males & females receiving 500 mg/kg/day VCH exhibited generalized toxicity manifested as an 8-10% decr in body weight throughout Task 4. These data indicate that VCH did not cause a detectable decr in reproductive competence in the F0 generation, nor was reproductive function adversely affected in F1 mice at doses that caused decreased body weight & ovarian & testicular toxicity.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 15.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-vinylcyclohexene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-vinylcyclohexene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone. The half-life for reaction with hydroxyl radicals in air is estimated to be 4.3 hours; and the half-life for reaction with ozone in air is estimated to be 1.3 hours. If released to soil, 4-vinylcyclohexene is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.5X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. 4-Vinylcyclohexene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 4-vinylcyclohexene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Based upon aerobic aqueous screening tests, 4-vinylcyclohexene is not expected to biodegrade rapidly. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.1 hours and 4.1 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 571 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 4-vinylcyclohexene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-vinylcyclohexene, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, or rubber compounds are produced or used. Consumers may be exposed to 4-vinylcyclohexene from volatiles from carpets based on monitoring data. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 4-vinylcyclohexene is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3).

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4.1 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 19 days if adsorption is considered(4). 4-Vinylcyclohexene's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

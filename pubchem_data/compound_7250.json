ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption), exposure to this colorless liquid may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate for dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. Contact with 2,4-xylidine may cause burns to the skin and eyes. Death is also a possible outcome from exposure. While the OSHA PEL is set at a TWA of 5 ppm, the ACGIH lists xylidine (mixed isomers) on its 1988-1989 Notice of Intended Changes with a proposed TLV of 0.5 ppm, and a designation of \"suspected human carcinogen\". In activities or situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, and full chemical protective clothing which is specifically recommended by the shipper or manufacturer to prevent skin contact with xylidine. If contact should occur, immediatly flush the affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. Do not eat or smoke in xylidine work areas. While xylidine does not ignite easily, it can burn with the production of irritating or poisonous gases. Also, containers may explode violently in the heat of a fire. Fires involving xylidine may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, or standard foam. Water spray if used, should be applied with caution because it may cause frothing. Fight the fire from a maximum distance and dike runoff from fire control water. Xylidine should be stored away from heat, strong oxidizers, and hypochlorite bleaches. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. If xylidine should spill, dike far ahead, then take up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and place into containers for later disposal. Incineration is a possible form of disposal for xylidine. Before implementing land disposal of waste 2,4-xylidine, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The biological determinant is an indicator of exposure to the chemical, but the quantitative interpretation of the measurement is ambiguous.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2,4-xylidine should exist mainly in the vapor phase based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.133 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2,4-xylidine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2 hours. An estimated Koc value of 200 suggests that 2,4-xylidine may have moderate mobility in soil. However, anilines are expected to bind strongly to humus or soil organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group; therefore, mobility may be much lower in some soils with high organic content. Volatilization of 2,4-xylidine may be important from moist soil surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Based on limited data, 2,4-xylidine may aerobically biodegrade in both soil and water. 2,4-Xylidine was completely biodegraded in soil cultures within 2 days and reached 36% degradation in 6 hours in an aqueous screening study using an activated sludge inoculum. However, it was classified as slow to biodegrade in the Japanese MITI test. As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals; typical half-lives for peroxy and hydroxy radical reactions are on the order of 19 and 30 sunlight hours, respectively. In water, 2,4-xylidine may strongly adsorb to suspended organic matter in the water column based on its structure (an aromatic amine). 2,4-Xylidine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 120 days, respectively, although adsorption to organic materials may attenuate this process. The potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is expected to be low based on an estimated BCF value of 11. Exposure to 2,4-xylidine may occur occupationally during its production or subsequent use in other manufacturing processes. (SRC)",

However, it was classified as slow to biodegrade in the Japanese MITI test(10). As a class, aromatic amines react relatively rapidly in sunlit natural water via reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and peroxy radicals(11); typical half-lives for peroxy and hydroxy radical reactions are on the order of 19 and 30 sunlight hours, respectively(11).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

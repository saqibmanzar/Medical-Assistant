PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Ketones are incompatible with isocyanates, aldehydes, cyanides, peroxides, and anhydrides. They react violently with aldehydes, HNO3, HNO3 + H2O2, and HClO4. Flammable and/or toxic gases are generated by the combination of alcohols with alkali metals, nitrides, and strong reducing agents. They react with oxoacids and carboxylic acids to form esters plus water. Oxidizing agents convert them to aldehydes or ketones. Alcohols exhibit both weak acid and weak base behavior. They may initiate the polymerization of isocyanates and epoxides.",

Small (unspecified) amounts of a 30% acetoin solution or ethyl-alcohol were injected ip into rats until the loss of the righting reflex or until respiratory failure. In another series, 5 mg/kg methyl-alcohol was injected, followed by acetoin until respiratory failure was induced. Blood was drawn and analyzed for the compounds. With loss of righting reflex, acetoin ranged from 227 to 251 mg percent with an average of 235 mg. Ethyl-alcohol ranged from 288 to 312 mg with an average of 300 mg. Acetoin intoxication resembled ethyl-alcohol intoxication. Upon respiratory failure, acetoin concentrations ranged from 742 to 770 mg percent with an average of 754 mg. Ethyl-alcohol ranged from 900 to 952 mg percent with an average of 920 mg. With combined administration, the concentrations of acetoin and ethyl-alcohol in the blood were additive in effect. The author concludes that acetoin is 1.4 times more intoxicating than ethyl-alcohol.",

Male Sprague-Dawley-rats were injected intraperitoneally with acetoine. Rats were starved before and after administration of chemicals. OC was measured between 1 and 6 hours after treatment using a diaferometer or a digital respirometer. ...In-vitro OC of rat diaphragma and liver slices was measured in a Warburg apparatus using Krebs phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. ...Acetoine at 3600 mg/kg had no influence on OC. ...No decrease in blood pressure was observed. Injection of 3600 mg/kg of acetoine made them comatose for several hours. Liver slices and diaphragms from normal or uremic rats showed a normal metabolic rate. Exposure to compounds at 30 mg/dL had no influence on tissue respiration. Addition of 400 mg/dL of urea and 20 mg/dL of creatinine had no influence on OC when given alone or in combination with chemicals.",

The body weights of males at 12,000 mg/kg in drinking-water decreased significantly from week 5, and at weeks 2, 6, and 13 the relative weight of the liver was statistically significantly greater in these animals than in controls. A similar effect was seen in female rats, but only after 13 weeks. Hematological examination conducted at 13 weeks showed a small (4-8%) but statistically significant (p<0.05) decrease in hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte counts in animals of each sex at the high dose, but these changes were not accompanied by a decrease in hematocrit. Urinalysis and blood chemical determinations performed at the end of the study on all animals revealed no statistically significant differences between treated and control groups. Histopathological examination also revealed no adverse effects. ...The increased relative liver weights /may have been/ a reaction of the liver to an increased metabolic load resulting from the high intake of acetoin.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acetoin will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase acetoin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 hours. Acetoin is not expected to undergo direct photolysis due to lack of absorption in the environmental UV spectrum. If released to soil, acetoin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Acetoin may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Ketones in general are resistant to biological degradation. A theoretical BOD of 13.8% following aerobic incubation for 24 hrs using activated sludge indicates that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, acetoin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 28 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 0.3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to acetoin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acetoin is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to acetoin via inhalation of perfume and fragrance vapors, dermal contact, and ingestion of food products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase acetoin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Acetoin is not expected to undergo photolysis due to the lack of absorption in the environmental UV spectrum(>290 nm)(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

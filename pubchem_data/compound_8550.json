Deserpidine is a competitive inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). By competing with angiotensin I for ACE, deserpidine blocks the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. Reduced level of serum angiotensin II causes a decrease in blood pressure. Deserpidine also decreases angiotensin II-induced aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

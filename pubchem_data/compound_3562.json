They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Supraventricular arrhythmias or nodal rhythm may be observed during induction or deep anesthesia. Small doses of epinephrine (1 to 1.5 ug/kg) may be administered subcutaneously or submucosally with halothane when adequate ventilation is assured. Exceeding this dose is potentially hazardous, however, since this anesthetic sensitizes the heart to catecholamines.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Inhibiting oxidative metabolism with deuterated halothane reduces resultant injury in our guinea pig model of acute halothane hepatoxicity. To elucidate whether covalent binding of reactive intermediates to proteins (oxidative pathway) or lipids (reductive pathway) is a mechanism of necrosis, male outbred Hartley guinea pigs (600-725 g), N = 8, were exposed to either 1% (v/v) halothane or deuterated halothane at either 40% or 10% oxygen for 4 hr. One-half of the animals were killed immediately after exposure for binding studies; the remainder at 96 hr post exposure for evaluation of hepatotoxicity. Covalent binding of halothane intermediates to liver protein or lipid was determined by measuring the fluoride content of the bound moieties. The use of deuterated halothane and/or 10% oxygen during exposure led to 63-88% reductions (p< 0.01) in plasma trifluoroacetic acid concn (halothane-40% oxygen = 546; 73 mM, N = 8) which were accompanied by 33-60% decreases (p< 0.01) in binding to liver proteins (halothane-40% oxygen = 1.36; 0.26 nmoles bound fluoride/mg protein, N = 4), 78-84% decreases (p< 0.05) in 48 hr plasma ALT levels (halothane- 40% oxygen = 308; 219, control = 23 + 3, N = 4) and a total amelioration of centilobular necrosis.",

Inhaled anesthetics act at many areas of the CNS.

Anesthetics may cause changes in membrane thickness, which in turn effects the gating properties of ion channels in neurons. Interference with the hydrophobic portion of neuronal ion channel membrane proteins may be an important mechanism."

In the present study online monitoring of halothane concn in the gas phase was demonstrated to be an improved test standard. The kinetics of halothane concn and their effect on in vitro muscle contracture tests were evaluated in two test baths, I and II, which contained 3 and 18 ml Krebs-Ringer solution, respectively. The equilibration kinetics for halothane was significantly faster in bath I (half-life = 8.2 sec) compared with bath II (half-life = 25.6 sec). Twenty one pairs of muscle bundles from 21 potentially malignant hyperthermia susceptible patients were investigated, each test bath receiving one bundle from each pair. The variance of muscle contractures was significantly increased in test bath I compared with test bath II. However, there was no influence on malignant hyperthermia diagnosis, suggesting that, within the ranges of half-life = 8.2 sec-25.6 sec, the test bath volumes need not be standardized.",

Experiments were performed to determine how exposure to halothane and isoflurane changes rat pulmonary artery endothelial cell viability in response to the toxic oxygen metabolites produced by stimulated phagocytic cells. Rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells were grown in monolayer culture. The monolayers were treated with phorbol myristate acetate stimulated human neutrophils at an effector-to-target ratio of 20:1 after equilibration with 0.4% or 1.7% halothane or 0.7% or 2.8% isoflurane. As measured by percent specific release of incorporated (51)Cr label (mean + or - standard error), cytotoxicity in the presence of 1.7% halothane (75.3 + or - 3.4%) was significantly greater (p< 0.02) than cytotoxicity in 5% carbon dioxide in air (44.7 + or - 3.3%) and in 0.4% halothane (57.3 + or - 4.7%). Also, cytotoxicity in 1.7% halothane was significantly greater than in 0.4% halothane (p< 0.02). It was found that rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells incubated in isoflurane exhibited significantly greater release of (51)Cr than cells incubated in the MAC equivalent concn of halothane: 78.2 + or - 2.6% in 0.7% isoflurane (p= 0.0004) and 83.8 + or - 1% in 2.8% isoflurane (p= 0.005). Because early neutrophil cytotoxicity has been found to be mediated primarily by hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide production by similar numbers of phorbol myristate acetate stimulated neutrophils under similar exposure conditions was measured. In carrier gas, phorbol myristate acetate stimulated neutrophils produced 20.5 + or - 1.3 nmole hydrogen peroxide/1X10+6 cells/hr. At the higher concn of halothane, hydrogen peroxide production actually was inhibited in comparison with carrier gas (15.4 + or - 1.4 nmole hydrogen peroxide/1X10+6 cells/hr in 1.7% halothane and 16.8 + or - 0.8 in 2.8% halothane), but the degree of inhibition did not reach statistical significance. In isoflurane, however, hydrogen peroxide production was not different from that seen in carrier gas. In other experiments, the monolayers were treated with 0, 200, 500, and 1,000 uM hydrogen peroxide after equilibration with 0.4%, 1.7%, and 2.8% halothane or 0.7%, 2.8%, and 5% isoflurane in 5% carbon dioxide in air. Efficiency of replating was used to measure degree of injury. Both halothane and isoflurane enhance the sensitivity of the rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cell monolayers to injury by hydrogen peroxide. The sensitizing effect of halothane was reversed by removing the anesthetic. Halothane and isoflurane thus enhance rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cell sensitivity to injury by both hydrogen peroxide and phorbol myristate acetate stimulated neutrophils. In increasing rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cell sensitivity to injury by oxygen metabolites, halothane and isoflurane may be inhibiting processes involved in intracellular antioxidant defenses.",

In order to provide more information about the nature of this susceptibility factor, the effect of removing calcium ions from the incubation medium of the test system was examined. Phenytoin metabolites were generated by incubating phenytoin with beta-naphthoflavone induced rat liver microsomes in the presence of 1,1,1-trichloropropene oxide, an epoxide hydrase inhibitor. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients who had recovered from halothane hepatitis were incubated in this system and the maintained in calcium ion-containing tissue culture medium (without alpha-tocopherol) for 16 hr, cell death, as measured by trypan blue exclusion, was greatly increased (53% and 78% at 0.06 mmol/l and 0.12 mmol/l phenytoin, respectively) compared with control incubations (1,1,1-trichloropropene oxide omitted). Removal of calcium ions from the tissue culture medium effectively abolished reactive metabolite-induced cell death. Resting cytosolic free calcium ion concn in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also measured using the quin-2 fluorescence method and total calcium ion content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. Although variability appeared greater among patients, mean values for these parameters among 12 patients with halothane hepatitis did not differ from controls. It is concluded that enhanced permeability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to extracellular calcium ion may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of drug metabolite induced cell death in patients susceptible to halothane hepatitis. Such permeability to calcium ion is not evident in resting cells and presumably results from an interaction between electrophilic metabolites and the pumps which regulate cell calcium homeostasis.",

Geometric mean nitrous oxide and halothane exposures for recovery staff not entering the theater were 27 ppm and 0.6 ppm, respectively; no recovery areas had scavenging. Geometric mean nitrous oxide exposures for anesthetists and for other staff excluding surgeons, respectively, were: 373 ppm and 203 ppm with zero air changes per hr, 202 ppm and 64 ppm with 10 to 15 air changes/hr, 124 ppm and 45 ppm with 15 to 20 air changes per hr, and 128 ppm and 40 ppm with more than 20 air changes/hr. Mean exposures to halothane and nitrous oxide were significantly greater with passive versus active scavenging for all staff and staff other than surgeons and anesthetists. With scavenging, 40 percent of nitrous oxide results were below 25 ppm while 88% of halothane results were below 2 ppm for all staff. It was concluded that good general ventilation and effective gas scavenging systems are essential for control of exposure to inhalation anesthetics in operating theaters.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Appearance of ALT levels above 10 times the upper limit of normal, however, is uncommon and points to significant hepatotoxicity. Clinically apparent, severe hepatic injury from halothane is rare, occurring in ~1/15,000 cases after initial exposure, but in ~1/1,000 cases after repeated exposures. The injury is marked by acute elevations in serum aminotransferase levels (5- to 50-fold) and appearance of jaundice within 2 to 14 days of surgery. There are usually minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase levels. Fever occurs before onset of jaundice in a high proportion of patients and eosinophilia in up to 30%. Rash and arthralgias can also accompany the onset of hepatic injury. The acute liver injury may be self-limited and resolve within 4 to 8 weeks, but can be severe and lead to acute liver failure. A strong risk factor is previous exposure to any of the halogenated anesthetics and particularly a history of halothane hepatitis or unexplained fever and rash after anesthesia with one of these agents. Other risk factors are hypotension, older age, obesity and concurrent use of CYP 2E1 inducers. The differential diagnosis of acute liver injury after surgery and anesthesia is sometimes difficult, and a clinical picture similar to halothane hepatitis can be caused by shock or ischemia, sepsis, other idiosyncratic forms of drug induced liver injury and acute viral or herpes hepatitis. Indeed, many cases of severe liver injury arising soon after surgery and attributed to halothane or other halogenated anesthetics in the literature probably represent liver injury from shock and ischemia. Factors favoring the diagnosis of ischemic hepatitis are rapid onset after surgery, extremely high values for ALT, AST and LDH, and subsequent rapid fall in serum enzymes.",

There is no published experience with the therapeutic use of halothane as an anesthetic during breastfeeding, but trace amounts were found in the milk of a practicing anesthesiologist who had administered halothane in the operating room. Various recommendations have been made regarding breastfeeding after halothane anesthesia, from discarding the first pumping after recovery to discarding breastmilk for 24 to 48 hours after the surgical procedure. Although withholding breastfeeding for 24 h is probably unnecessary, a short-acting anesthetic is preferred. In one study, breastfeeding before general anesthesia induction reduced requirements of sevoflurane and propofol compared to those of nursing mothers whose breastfeeding was withheld or nonnursing women. It is possible that requirements for other anesthetic agents would be affected similarly.",

Respiratory depression should be treated by reducing the concentration of halothane and by assisted respiration.

Samples of urine were collected anaerobically from all subjects at the beginning and end of the 4 hr exposure period and analyzed for their halothane concn. Measurements of the time weighted average environmental halothane concn in the breathing zone were made by use of diffusive personal samplers. Breathing zone environmental halothane concn for the 58 subjects ranged from 0.35 to 74.9 mg/cu m, with a median value of 10.38 mg/cu m. Halothane was observed in the urine of all 58 subjects and ranged from 0.5 to 22.4 ug/l, with a median value of 6.55 ug/l. A significant correlation was noted between halothane urine concn and the time weighted average breathing zone concn. Calculations were made of biological exposure limits corresponding to the threshold values proposed in the literature. These limits were calculated to be 92, 6.5, and 3.9 ug/l, corresponding to environmental exposures of 50, 2, and 0.5 ppm, respectively. It was concluded that the urinary halothane concn provides an appropriate biological index of the magnitude of exposure during the production time of urine. This proposed method of measuring halothane urinary concn can be easily and rapidly performed.",

However, the specificity and sensitivity of proposed North American diagnostic guidelines for this test have never been evaluated in a large, human study population. Therefore, a multiinstitutional, prospective study of skeletal muscle contracture responses in a subject population at low risk for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility was conducted to help determine the specificity of the proposed guidelines. Subjects were selected arbitrarily from a population of patients undergoing surgery unrelated to performance of a diagnostic muscle biopsy. Subjects were admitted to this study and were presumed nonsusceptible if there was no evidence of any of the following malignant hyperthermia risk factors: prior abnormal response to triggering anesthetic agents, myopathy, or family history of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Rejection of the proposed diagnostic guidelines was suggested if an 85% specificity estimate among subjects could not be obtained. The responses of 1,022 muscle fascicles, derived from 176 subjects, were analyzed to the following: 1) separate administration of 3% halothane or incremental caffeine concn, or 2) the joint administration of 1% halothane and incremental caffeine concn. The following contracture results were obtained. First, for individual fascicles, 9.2% exceeded a greater than 0.7 g threshold for 3% halothane, 15.2% exceeded a greater than or equal to 0.2 g threshold for 2 mM caffeine, 32.4% exceeded a 1 g increase for less than 4 mM caffeine, 2.6% had a greater than 7% maximal increase in tension at 2 mM caffeine, and 63.5% had a \"halothane caffeine specific concn\" at less than or equal to 1 mM caffeine. Second, the percentages of subjects with 1 or more fascicles exceeding the proposed threshold were as follows: 45.8% for the four component, 28.8% for the three component, and 32.7% for the two component contracture test. Third, the percentages of subjects with 1 or more fascicles exceeding the proposed threshold for both halothane and caffeine were as follows: 9.5% for 3% halothane and 2 mM caffeine, 2.0% for 3% halothane and 7% maximal increase in tension at 2 mM caffeine, and 11.0% for 1% halothane and 2 mM caffeine. Fourth, center-to-center differences were the major source of variation in the rate that subjects exceeded proposed thresholds. These data demonstrate that proposed diagnostic guidelines must be modified to improve specificity estimates before adoption by diagnostic centers.",

Patients, aged 65 + or - 3 yr (mean + or - standard error), received oxygen and nitrous oxide (1:1) and either 0.75% isoflurane (n = 7) or 0.5% halothane (n = 7). Patient demographic and clinical data were similar for both groups and followed the expected strata of patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Measurements were made during the period of temporary bypass shunting. In the isoflurane group, increasing arterial carbon dioxide tension from 33.3 + or - 1.4 to 43.4 + or - 1.3 mm mercury resulted in a significant (p< 0.05) increase in cerebral blood flow from 21 + or - 1 to 35 + or - 4 ml/100 g/min. In the halothane group, increasing arterial carbon dioxide tension from 31.1 + or - 1 to 39.4 + or - 1.6 mm mercury resulted in a significant increase in cerebral blood flow from 26 + or - 3 to 37 + or - 3 mL/100 g/min. Mean cerebral blood flow reactivity to changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension (mL/100 g/min/mm mercury) was 1.74 + or - 0.39 for isoflurane and 1.78 + or - 0.4 for halothane (not significant), corresponding to a relative change of 4.8% + or - 0.8% and 5.2% + or - 1.3% per mm mercury, respectively. There is no significant difference between halothane and isoflurane in their effects on carbon dioxide reactivity in the mildly hypocapnic to normocapnic range.",

In a series of experiments, animals were exposed to fluothane by inhalation or intragastric administration for determination of the median lethal dose (LD50). Allergic reactions were determined in rabbits immunized by subcutaneous injections of a conjugate of fluothane with protein carriers, and in guinea pigs exposed by inhalation to 200 to 1,000 mg/cu m fluothane for 30 days. The cutaneous resorptive effect was measured in mice and rats by immersing the tail in the pure substance 4 hr a day for 10 days. The LD50 for inhalation exposure was 93,600 mg/cu m for mice, 120,000 mg/cu m for male rats, and 96,000 mg/cu m for female rats. The LD50 for intragastric administration was 5,680 mg/kg for white rats and 6,000 mg/kg for guinea pigs. Animals that died showed symptoms of central nervous system disorder and had pronounced hemodynamic disorders. Fluothane caused no local skin irritating or resorptive effects. ...",

Male Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to halothane in a variety of doses given by ip injection or by inhalation of a 1% mixture in air. One group of rats received halothane treatment only, and another group received phenobarbital pretreatment and halothane treatment. Controls were also maintained. Body weights and liver to body weight ratios were recorded for all animals. Histopathological examinations were conducted. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activities were also determined. All rats that received halothane injections lost weight, even at the lowest doses. Liver to body weight ratios were depressed in rats receiving 2 mL/kg halothane but not in animals also receiving phenobarbital. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was not affected, but serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase activity was elevated by 2 mL/kg halothane, and by 1 and 2 mL/kg halothane with phenobarbital pretreatment. Gross pathology in rats given 2 mL/kg halothane with or without phenobarbital ranged from nearly normal to severe peritonitis with ascites and adhesions. These effects disappeared with lower halothane doses and were attributed to local irritation. No profound liver damage was seen in halothane treated rats, and phenobarbital pretreatment did not alter the responses to halothane. In inhalation studies, the combination of halothane and phenobarbital caused greater weight loss than either compound alone. Liver to body weight ratio was increased slightly by phenobarbital. Halothane did not reverse this increase, even though it decreased the ratio when given alone. Average lactate dehydrogenase activity did not change with exposure to halothane. Phenobarbital, with or without halothane, seemed to decrease serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activity. Only minor single cell necrosis was seen in liver sections of some rats that received phenobarbital or halothane alone or in combination. No histopathological changes were seen in the controls. It was concluded that under the conditions studied, phenobarbital pretreatment does not potentiate halothane toxicity.",

Oxidative halothane biotransformation was inhibited by the use of deuterated halothane, whereas reductive metabolism was enhanced by low inspired oxygen concn. Male outbred Hartley guinea pigs (n = 8) were exposed to either 1% (v/v) halothane or deuterated halothane, with a fractional inspired oxygen concn of 0.40 or 0.10, for 4 hr. Livers removed from half of the animals immediately after anesthesia were evaluated for organic fluorine bound to protein and lipid. The remaining animals were evaluated for a hepatotoxic response up to 96 hr after exposure. Only guinea pigs that received 1% halothane at a fractional inspired oxygen concn of 0.40 had centrilobular necrosis develop with significantly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase activities. All other treatment conditions significantly reduced oxidative halothane biotransformation, as indicated by decreased plasma trifluoroacetic acid concn. These reductions were associated with a significant decrease in organic fluorine bound to hepatic proteins. A fractional inspired oxygen concn of 0.10 during halothane anesthesia significantly enhanced reductive biotransformation, as indicated by plasma fluoride ion concn. This was associated with a significant increase in organic fluoride bound to hepatic lipids. Centrilobular necrosis did not develop under these conditions. Thus, covalent binding to subcellular proteins by the trifluoroacetyl acid chloride intermediate generated by oxidative halothane biotransformation is implicated as a mechanism of centrilobular necrosis in guinea pigs. Binding to lipids by reductive pathway generated free radicals does not appear to be involved in production of the lesion.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 302 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be approximately one year. Given its long atmospheric lifetime, some percentage of 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to diffuse slowly into the stratosphere where it will undergo direct photolysis by UV-C radiation, releasing radicals that contribute to damage of the ozone layer. If released to soil, 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 425. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0203 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. No biodegradation data were located for 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane, and it is unlikely to be an important environmental fate process due to the rapid rate of volatilization from soil and water. If released into water, 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 6 days, respectively. 2-Bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane is an alkyl halide which may be susceptible to hydrolysis; however its estimated hydrolysis half-life is several years and is not likely to be environmentally relevant. An estimated BCF of 12 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane may occur by inhalation or dermal contact during its production or use as an anaesthetic. The general population may be exposed to 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane during surgical procedures where it is used as an anaesthetic. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane has been detected in drinking water, carpets, and in human adipose tissue. If released to soil, bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane will be immobile. Volatilization of bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane should not be important from moist or dry soil. Based on a MITI biodegradation test, bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane will not biodegrade in soil. If released to water, bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane will adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane may not volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.9X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Experimental BCF values of 23-37 and 60-125 suggest that bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Based on a MITI biodegradation test, bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane will not biodegrade in water. If released to the atmosphere, bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane will exist in the particulate phase. Particulate-phase bis(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylphenyl)methane may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

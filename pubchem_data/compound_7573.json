When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

A total of 22 urine samples were collected from each worker at the beginning and end of each work day over a 2 week period. ... Rapid excretion of IPPD occurred during the working day, with mean levels of IPPD in urine samples collected before and after shifts of 19.55 and 83.57 micrograms per liter (microg/l), respectively. A total of 4.4 percent of before and 28.7 percent of after shift samples showed no detectable IPPD. A second slow component of excretion was observed during the week, with mean concentrations in before shift samples rising from 10.8 to 25.8microg/l between the beginning and end of the week. In a skin absorption experiment, with one of the authors as subject, one hand was immersed in water containing IPPD for 90 minutes. IPPD levels in the urine were measured at 0, 3, 5, and 10.5 hours after exposure, and were found to be 0, 100, 350, and 570 ug/l, respectively. The excretion rate ceased 7 days after exposure. It was concluded that the kinetics of excretion of IPPD in workers exposed daily to this compound has two different components, an initially rapid one followed by a slow one, and that there are three different components of excretion kinetics after skin absorption with half times of 3, 7, and 24 hours.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The cohort consisted of 32 Czech patients sensitized to N-isopropyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, as determined by patch tests. The comparisons consisted of 159 persons from the general Slovak population who were unrelated to the patients. Blood samples were collected and serological typing for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C and the HLA-Dw antigens HLA-Dw1, HLA-Dw2, HLA-Dw3, HLA-Dw4, HLA-Dw5, HLA-Dw7, HLA-Dw8, hLA-Dw9, HLA-Dw10, and HLA-Dw11 was performed. The prevalence of HLA-Dw3 in thecohort was significantly elevated relative to the comparisons, 37.5 versus 8.7%.The increased HLA-Dw3 prevalence was associated with a relative risk of 6.3 of developing allergy to N-isopropyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine. The prevalence of the HLA-Dw4 antigen was nonsignificantly elevated in the cohort. The prevalence of the other HLA antigens did not differ significantly between the two groups. The authors conclude that allergy to N-isopropyl-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine has a polygenetic background and that genes of theHLA antigen complex are involved.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.4X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. Particulate-phase 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, the non-protonated form of 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.3X10+4. The estimated pKa of 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine is 5.1, indicating that this compound will exist only slightly in the cation form. Cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because the cation is not expected to volatilize. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. The estimated pKa of 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine is 5.1, indicating that this compound will exist only slightly in the cation form. Cations generally adsorb to suspended solids and sediment more strongly than their neutral counterparts. An estimated BCF of 67 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-(iso-propylamino)diphenylamine is produced or used.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

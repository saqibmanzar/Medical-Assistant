When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Samples collected in 1-l glass bottles are purged at 60 C for 1 hr in an ultrapure helium gas stream using an open loop arrangement. Volatile eluates are trapped onto selective adsorbents packed inside stainless steel tubes connected in series. After stripping at a flow rate of 100 mg/min for 60 min, the adsorbent tubes are disconnected, fitted with analytical desorption caps and sequentially desorbed for 10 min on a thermal desorber. The desorbed organics are trapped at 30 C on a packed cold trap prior to flash volatilization of the volatiles across a fused silica transfer line onto a capillary column. The method separated over 200 organic compounds within 40 min using flame ionization and ion trap detection and is capable of quantitation down to 5 ng/l per component. The recoveries of indene from water at 30 and 60 C were 71 and 100%, respectively. A specimen purge seawater standard chromatogram (Tenax-TA tube) revealed the presence of indene. Indene was also seen in chromatograms of water samples taken from Solent estuary in southern England.",

It is released to the environment in emissions from biomass combustion, auto exhaust, polymer combustion, polymer manufacture, tobacco smoke, ethylene combustion, waste incineration, motor boat emissions; in wastewater from paper-mills, creosote waste disposal sites, and coal-tar distillation and wood treatment facilities. If released to the atmosphere, indene will exist primarily in the vapor phase and is rapidly degraded by photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 6.2 hr). In water, bioconcentration, hydrolysis, and oxidation via reaction with alkyl peroxy radicals are not expected to be important. Volatilization from water is fast with estimated half-lives of 3.7 hrs and 4.4 days from a model river and model lake, respectively. Indene may adsorb to sediment and suspended matter. Limited data suggest that indene is biodegradable in water and soil. If released to soil surfaces, indene may photolyze or volatilize. In soil, indene is expected to have low soil mobility and a moderate adsorption potential. Human exposure to indene occurs through inhalation of contaminated air and consumption of food and water.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

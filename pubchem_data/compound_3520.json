In contrast, plasma guanidinoacetic acid concentrations were significantly decreased. Erythrocyte concentrations of creatinine, guanidinosuccinic acid, guanidine and methylguanidine were also markedly elevated. No correlation was observed between plasma creatinine concentration and erythrocyte concentration of guanidinosuccinic acid or methylguanidine.

Increased levels of uremic toxins can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. This seems to be mediated by the direct binding or inhibition by uremic toxins of the enzyme NADPH oxidase (especially NOX4 which is abundant in the kidneys and heart) (A7868). Reactive oxygen species can induce several different DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are involved in the silencing of a protein known as KLOTHO.  KLOTHO has been identified as having important roles in anti-aging, mineral metabolism, and vitamin D metabolism. A number of studies have indicated that KLOTHO mRNA and protein levels are reduced during acute or chronic kidney diseases in response to high local levels of reactive oxygen species (A7869). ",

Guanidine uptake was only minimally inhibited by organic cations such as tetraethylammonium, N1-methylnicotinamide, and choline, but many other organic cations such as amiloride, clonidine, imipramine, and harmaline caused considerable inhibition. Uptake of radiolabeled guanidine was inhibited more effectively by guanidine than by tetraethylammonium, whereas uptake of radiolabeled tetraethylammonium was inhibited more effectively by tetraethylammonium than by guanidine. beta-Lactam antibiotics did not inhibit guanidine uptake but did inhibit tetraethylammonium uptake. Kinetic analysis showed that there were at least two kinetically distinct carrier systems for guanidine uptake, whereas tetraethylammonium uptake occurred via a single carrier system ...",

In the present study ... the effects of some of these compounds on basal and stimulated nitric oxide activity in human renal arteries /were tested/ ... Rings from human renal arteries were obtained from 22 patients undergoing nephrectomy ... The effects of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), N(G),N(G)-dimethyl-L-arginine (asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA)), aminoguanidine (AG), and methylguanidine (MG) on artery rings under basal and stimulated conditions /were studied/ ... In precontracted arteries, L-NMMA (1 umol/L to 1 mmol/L) and ADMA (1 umol/L to 3 mmol/L) caused concentration- and endothelium-dependent contractions (median effective concentrations (EC50) = 13.3 umol/L and 17.5 umol/L, respectively; Emax = 15 + or - 4% and 17 + or - 4% of the response to 100 mmol/L KCl, respectively). Aminoguanidine (0.01 to 3 mmol/L) and MG (0.01 to 3 mmol/L) produced endothelium-independent contractions (Emax = 9 + or -3% and 16 + or - 2% of the response to 100 mmol/L KCl, respectively). L-arginine (1 mmol/L) but not D-arginine (1 mmol/L) prevented the contractions by L-NMMA and ADMA, but did not change contractions induced by AG and MG. In precontracted arteries, the relaxation to acetylcholine was decreased but not abolished by L-NMMA and ADMA. The remaining relaxation was reduced by charybdotoxin (0.1 mol/L) and tetraethylammonium (1 mmol/L) ... The results demonstrate that L-NMMA and ADMA reduce basal and stimulated nitric oxide activity in human renal arteries. An increase in the plasma concentrations of methylarginines associated with renal disease should be considered as a risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and abnormal vasomotor tone in human renal arteries. /Endogenous guanidine compounds/",

Guanidino succinic acid (GSA) and methyl guanidine (MG) ... reflect the pathological stage of nephritis. GSA correlates well with blood urea nitrogen and therefore indicates the reduction of renal function. MG does not appear in the early stage of renal failure and abruptly increases at the stage of serious uremia. /Guanidino compounds/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates guanidine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase guanidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours. Guanidine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, guanidine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 20. The pKa of guanidine is 12.5, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely as a cation in the environment. As a result, guanidine may have greater adsorption and less mobility than its estimated Koc value indicates since cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than neutral species. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not an important fate process since cations do not volatilize. Guanidine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Guanidine was degraded in soil samples maintained under aerobic conditions at varying rates which were dependent upon the initial guanidine soil concentration. At an initial concn of 10 mg/kg, guanidine was 78% biodegraded after 10 days; however, at an initial concn of 400 mg/kg, guanidine was 62% biodegraded after 25 days. If released into water, guanidine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. However, guanidine has a pKa of 12.5 and will exist almost entirely as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9). As a result, guanidine may have greater adsorption to suspended to solids and sediment than its estimated Koc value indicates. Volatilization from water surfaces will not be an important fate process since cations do not volatilize. Guanidine was completely degraded in stream water obtained near a nitroguanidine production facility in 20 days following an initial lag period 11 days. BCF values of <0.1 to 0.1 measured in fish suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to guanidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where guanidine is produced or used. (SRC)",

However, guanidine has a pKa of 12.5(3) and should exist almost entirely as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9)(SRC). As a result, guanidine may have greater adsorption and less mobility than its estimated Koc value indicates since cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than neutral species(4). Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not an important environmental fate process since cations do not volatilize(SRC). The potential to volatilize from dry soil surfaces exists based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.2 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5). Guanidine was degraded in soil samples incubated under aerobic conditions at varying rates as a function of the initial starting concentration(6). At an initial concentration of 10 mg/kg, guanidine was 78% biodegraded after 10 days; however, at an initial concentration of 400 mg/kg, guanidine was 62% biodegraded after 25 days(6).",

However, guanidine has a pKa of 12.5(3) and should exist almost entirely as a cation under environmental conditions (pH 5-9)(SRC). As a result, guanidine may have greater adsorption to suspended solids and sediment than its estimated Koc value indicates(SRC). Volatilization of guanidine from water surfaces will not be an important fate process, since cations do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), BCF values in the range of <0.1 to 0.1 measured in fish(5), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).  Complete guanidine degradation in stream water samples obtained near a nitroguanidine production facility was observed in 20 days after an initial lag period 11 days and 68 days following a lag period 52 days(5).",

Gaunidine was degraded when incubated in stream water samples obtained near 2 nitroguanidine pilot plant facilities following long lag periods(2). Complete gaunidine degradation in the water samples ranged from 20 days(lag period 11 days) to 68 days (lag period 52 days)(2). The rate of guanidine hydrochloride degradation was studied in soil samples maintained under aerobic conditions obtained from Fort Detrick, MD(3). Rapid degradation was observed for low initial concentrations of guanidine, but rates of degradation decreased with increasing nominal concentration. At an initial concn of 10 mg/kg, guanidine was 78% biodegraded after 10 days; however, at an initial concn of 400 mg/kg, guanidine was 62% biodegraded after 25 days(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

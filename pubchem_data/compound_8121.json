PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Ethylene glycol diacetate has been detected as a volatile pollutant in a rubber manufacturing plant, in printer's inks, and as a volatile component of chicken. If released to soil, ethylene glycol diacetate is expected to have very high mobility. Volatilization of ethylene glycol diacetate is not expected to be important from moist soil surfaces but may occur from dry soil surfaces based on this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mol and a measured vapor pressure of 7.74X10-2 mm Hg, respectively. Ethylene glycol diacetate is expected to biodegrade in soil and water based on Hach respirometric and OECD Screening (die-away) tests using sewage inocula. If released to water, ethylene glycol diacetate would not adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Ethylene glycol diacetate will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF value of 1.2 suggests that ethylene glycol diacetate will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Ethylene glycol will hydrolyze with estimated half-lives of 15 days at pH of 8 and 152 days at a pH of 7. If released to the atmosphere, ethylene glycol diacetate will exist as a vapor based on its measured vapor pressure. Vapor-phase ethylene glycol diacetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 4.1 days.(SRC)",

Ethylene glycol diacetate will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure (3) and water solubility(4). An estimated BCF value of 1.2(1,SRC), from an estimated log Kow(5,SRC), suggests that ethylene glycol diacetate will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC), according to a recommended classification scheme(6). The half-lives for the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of ethylene glycol diacetate have been estimated to be 15 days at pH of 8 and 152 days at a pH of 7(7,SRC). Ethylene glycol diacetate is expected to biodegrade in water based on Hach respirometric and OECD Screening (die-away) tests using sewage inocula(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

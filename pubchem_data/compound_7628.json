PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

This is supported by the evidence in both human and animal studies, where more than 90% of the administered dose of borate is excreted as boric acid. There is evidence in both in vitro and in vivo systems that boric acid has an affinity for cis-hydroxyl groups, and this may be the mechanism that explains the biological effects of boric acid. However, this attachment is known to be reversible and concentration dependent, responding to clearance mechanisms.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Coarse gangue is separated by rake classifiers and fine particles are settled in a thickener. The boric acid strong liquor (high borate concentration) is nearly saturated with sodium sulfate. Complete solubility of sodium sulfate is maintained throughout the process by careful control of pH and temperature. The strong liquor is filtered at 98 \u00b0C and boric acid crystallized in two stages using continuous evaporative crystallizers. The temperature is dropped to 70 \u00b0C in the first stage and to 35 \u00b0C in the second. Crystals are filtered and washed with progressively weaker liquor in a countercurrent fashion. The final product is dried in rotary driers and screened for packaging.",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Previous results have shown that exposure of pregnant rats on GD10 to either hyperthermia (42C) or boric acid (BA) specifically targets segmentation patterns. Exposure to hyperthermia increased the prevalence of fused and/or reduced numbers of vertebrae and ribs, primarily in the thoracic area. BA (500-1000 mg/kg, single oral dose) resulted in a significant increase in segmentation defects similar to those seen after hyperthermia, with a greater incidence in lumbar defects. In this study, we focused on the interaction of these two agents and their effects on axial skeletal development. Pregnant rats were treated on GD10 as follows: Anesthesia with Nembutal (30 mg/kg), followed by oral dosing with either water or BA (500 mg/kg) and immersion in a water bath at 37C (30 min) or 42C (rectal temp maintained at 42C for 5 min). After delivery, pups were evaluated on postnatal day (PND) 1 and 3 for number, sex, and weight. No differences were seen in litter size, pup survival, or pup weight in any of the groups. On PND3, pups were examined and processed for skeletal staining with alizarin red and alcian blue. Preliminary data indicate an increase in skeletal alterations with BA+37C (47%), water+42C (75%), or BA+42C (67%), as compared to water+37C controls (0%). Alterations included defects in ribs and vertebrae and a decrease in the number of presacral vertebrae. Because the incidence of segmentation defects in the water+42C group was high, any interaction between BA and hyperthermia might have been obscured...",

If shock develops, it may be necessary to infuse plasma or whole blood. Administer oxygen continuously. If oliguria (less than 25 to 30 mL urine per hour) occurs, intravenous fluids must be slowed or stopped to avoid overloading the circulation.

The present study was conducted to investigate the reproductive effects of boron exposure in workers employed in boric acid production plant in Bandirma, Turkey. In order to characterize the external and internal boron exposures, boron was determined in biological samples (blood, urine, semen), in workplace air, in food, and in water sources. Unfavorable effects of boron exposure on the reproductive toxicity indicators (concentration, motility, morphology of the sperm cells and blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and total testosterone) were not observed. The mean calculated daily boron exposure (DBE) of the highly exposed group was 14.45 +/- 6.57 (3.32-35.62) mg/day. These human exposures represent worst-case exposure conditions to boric acid/borates in Turkey. These exposure levels are considerably lower than exposures, which have previously led to reproductive effects in experimental animals. ...",

Male and female Swiss (CD-l) mice were exposed to BA at concentrations of 0, 1000, 4500, or 9000 ppm in the feed; this produced estimated consumption levels of approximately 152, 636, and 1262 mg/kg bw. During 14 wks of cohabitation with continuous access to a BA-containing diet, no litters of dead or live pups were produced by 9000 ppm cohabited pairs. Among the litters born to pairs fed BA at 4500 ppm, live litter size and pup body weight were significantly reduced in comparison to controls. All aspects of fertility were unaffected at 1000 ppm BA. A crossover mating trial (Task 3) at the end of the continuous cohabitation phase, using the middle dose group, confirmed the male as the affected sex, with observed fertility rates of: 0 ppm male x 0 ppm female, 74%; 4500 ppm male x 0 ppm female, 5%; and 0 ppm male x 4500 ppm female, 65%. The mating index was 79%, 30% and 70% for the same groups. Additionally, adjusted body weights, for pups born from the mating of control male x 4500 ppm female, were significantly decreased from controls (P<O.Ol), indicating that the female and/or pup are also affected by BA. At sacrifice, after 27 wks of BA exposure, the F0 males fed 9000 ppm BA had significantly lower body weight and reproductive organ weights (testes, combined caput and corpus epididymis and cauda epididymis) and significantly fewer spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis. Males fed 4500 ppm BA also had significantly lower testes, epididymis, prostate weight and fewer spermatozoa in the cauda epididymis. Organ weights were unaffected at 1000 ppm BA for the F0 males. The germinal epithelium of F0 males in the 9000 ppm group was atrophied and consisted mostly of Sertoli cells with occasional spermatogonia. The 4500 ppm group had fewer spermatids than in the controls; multinucleate giant cells were observed. Sperm concentration/mg cauda was dramatically reduced in 9000 ppm males (2.8+/-1.7 x 10+3) compared to controls (519+/-36 x 10+3). Motility was difficult to quantify due to extremely low sperm concentrations. In 4500 ppm males, both sperm concentration (146.9+/-26.5 x 10+3)and sperm motility (53.3+/- 8.2%) were lower than in controls (519+/-36 x 10+3 sperm with 78.1+/-3.0% motility). Males fed 1000 ppm BA had normal sperm concentrations with reduced motility (69.0+/-4.5%). At necropsy, F0 female body weight was significantly decreased in the high dose group. The F0 females in the 4500 ppm group had significantly decreased kidney/adrenals and liver weights. The F1 mice exposed to dietary BA (0 and 1000 ppm), beginning at conception, had normal fertility. The adjusted mean body weight of F2 pups was decreased. However, the number of live pups/litter, the proportion of pups born alive, sex of pups born alive, and unadjusted weights of pups born alive, were not significantly changed by BA exposure. At necropsy, F1 males had normal reproductive organ weights and sperm motility. However, BA treatment decreased sperm concentrations in F1 males (585.6+/-32.5 x 10+3 in controls vs. 442.6+/-51.2 x 10+3). Female F1 mice had significantly greater uterus and kidney/adrenal weights than controls. This study confirms that BA is a reproductive toxicant in mice, primarily through an effect in the male. The 1000 ppm dose approached a No Observed Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) for the adult reproductive system, as well as for the developing reproductive system.",

The incidence of fetal malformations was significantly increased at greater than or equal to 0.2% dietary boric acid (2, 3, 8, 50 and 73% malformed fetuses/litter in the control through high-dose groups). The most frequently observed malformations were enlarged lateral ventricles of the brain, and agenesis or shortening of rib XIII. As an associated finding, the incidence of Lumbar I rib(s), a common variation in the CD rat, was reduced following boric acid treatment. In conclusion, the NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 0.1% dietary boric acid and the LOAEL was 0.2%. Embryo/fetal toxicity occurred in all treatment groups (greater than or equal to 0.1%).",

In the present study, boric acid (0, 0.8, 1.6 or 2.4% in the diet) was provided to timed-mated female /Sprague-Dawley derived/ rats from gd 14 to 17. During the treatment period, the vehicle control group was fed undosed diet ad libitum, and a pair-fed control group was provided with the median amount of food consumed (g of food/kg of body wt/day) by the 2.4% boric acid group. During the remainder of the study, dams and pups had ad libitum access to undosed diet, except during the second week of lactation (Phase I) when food consumption exceeded the available supply of food during one measurement period. Thus, dam and pup data collected on pnd 14, 21 and 26 may have been compromised due to this temporary shortage of food. ... Maternal body weight on gd 20 (both phases), maternal weight gain for the gestational period as a whole (gd 0 to 20, both phases), gravid uterine weight (Phase II) and corrected maternal weight gain on gd 20 (Phase II) were not affected by boric acid exposure or by pair feeding. Maternal relative liver weight was increased on gd 20 (Phase II) by 1.6 and 2.4% boric acid, but not by pair feeding. This effect on relative liver weight was not present on pnd 21. No changes were noted for maternal relative kidney weight on gd 20 or pnd 21 in either the boric acid or pair-fed groups relative to the vehicle (ad libitum) control group. ... Fetal body weight was significantly reduced in the low, mid, and high dose boric acid groups on gd 20 (82%, 68% and 69% of control weight, respectively). By pnd 21, recovery from body weight deficits was complete for the low dose group (104% of control weight). Persistent body weight deficits were observed at the mid dose (83% of control weight; biologically relevant but not statistically significant) and at the high dose (75% of control weight: statistically significantly). Prenatal mortality was not affected on gd 20 (Phase II), but cumulative post-implantation mortality through pnd 21 was increased at the high dose (34%, 44%, 33% and 72% for the vehicle control through high-dose boric acid groups, respectively). The incidence of treatment-related mortality was most pronounced during the early postnatal period (pnd 0 to 4) as follows: 2%, 8%, 27% and 44% of pups per litter in the vehicle control through high-dose boric acid groups, respectively. No treatment-related effects were noted for the incidence of craniofacial, palatal or CNS structural defects. ... These results indicate that boric acid can reduce fetal body weight to 69% of control weight on gd 20 without a concomitant increase in the incidence of ventricular enlargement. However, this study did not answer the question of whether boric acid could induce more severe weight reductions without concomitant ventricular enlargement, or whether there is a sensitive period earlier in gestation for induction of ventricular enlargement in the absence of fetal body weight effects. Preliminary evidence is provided that exposure to boric acid (1.6% or 2.4% on gd 14 to 17) may alter brain weights (total and/or regional), but such effects were not found at 0.8% boric acid. Boric acid-induced developmental toxicity in this study occurred independently of maternal food intake and body weight deficits, since the pair-fed control group did not differ from the ad libitum control group for any developmental measure in this study.",

A 5 ml aqueous solution of 0, 62.5, 125, or 250 mg/kg/day was orally administered to 30 females per group on days 6-19 of gestation. Two early, non-treatment related mortalities were recorded, one each in the 62.5 mg/kg/day group and the 125 mg/kg/day group. Does from the 250 mg/kg/day group exhibited vaginal bleeding with associated pregnancy loss. This group also showed decreased food consumption, body weight, weight change during treatment, and gravid uterine weight relative to controls. No clinical signs of toxicity were seen in the other groups.  Evidence of developmental toxicity at 250 mg/kg/day included a 90% average rate of resorption compared to 6% for controls, and complete prenatal loss (73% compared to 0% for controls). No maternal toxicity or developmental effects were noted for groups receiving 62.5 or 125 mg/kg/day. The incidence of late fetal deaths was low for all groups relative to controls and showed no relationship to dose. The overall incidence of external fetal changes was statistically significantly increased in litters from the 250 mg/kg/day group, but a dose-response relationship for individual changes was not shown. Changes in the cardio-vascular system observed in fetuses from the high dose group (250 mg/kg/day) occurred with statistically significant frequency and included interventricular septal defects, enlarged aorta, papillary muscle malformations, and the pulmonary artery and the aorta arising from the right ventricle. External fetal changes at 62.5 and 125 mg/kg/day were comparable to controls. The incidence of skeletal changes was comparable for all groups.",

The effect of the test substances was measured as a change of the net photosynthesis. Low B concentrations up to 2 mg B/L, which can be found in highly polluted waters, had only a small negative effect on R. penicillatus and E. canadensis. Stronger damages occurred with 5 mg B/l on M. alterniflorum and with 10 mg/L on the other 2 spp. The toxicity of different B compounds to E. canadensis at 2 mg B/L increased from boric acid and perborate to metaborate and borax. Boron trioxide had no negative influence after 21 test days in comparison with the control. Ecophysiological tests demonstrated that M. alterniflorum is a highly competitive species in oligotrophic softwater. The opinion of B as an environmental hazard has to be revised. At least in softwater systems, B had a much higher toxicity than formerly assumed.",

There were 4 replicates for each test concentration and the control, resulting in 5 daphnids per replicate or a total of 20 organisms per concentration. ...The chronic study began by placing one neonate in each tube, where the daphnid remained for the entire study. Each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday the young produced by each adult were counted and discarded, and adult survival was recorded. In addition, on the same days, the dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature in each test concentration and the control were measured and recorded. After enumeration of the young, the adults were transferred to clean beakers containing fresh test and control solutions, in addition to a new supply of food. The boric acid test concentrations used for the chronic test were 7, 14, 28, 56, and 105 mg/L as boron. ...The mean boron concentration was 0, 6.4, 13.6, 29.4, and 59.3 at 0, 7, 14, 28, and 56 mg/L, respectively. ...Throughout the chronic test the dissolved oxygen and temperature ranged from 7.3-8.0 mg/L and 19.5-20.5 \u00b0C, respectively. Mortality during the 21-day test was 0, 0, 10, 5, and 40% at 0, 7, 14, 28, and 56 mg/L, respectively. /No/... daphnids exposed to the highest concentration of boric acid (105 mg/L as boron) ... survived to reproductive age. Time to first reproduction was not affected by the test concentrations. The mean number of broods per daphnid, mean total young per daphnid, mean brood size per daphnid, and mean size all differed significantly from control at 13.6 mg/L. It appeared that the most biologically, as well as statistically, important endpoints for this study were those associated with reproduction and growth. Therefore, determination of the /maximum acceptable toxicant concentration/ (MATC) was based on the endpoints of mean total young per replicate, mean brood size, and mean size. The MATC of boric acid was estimated to lie between 6.4 and 13.6 mg/L as boron.",

Each test consisted of exposing groups of 10 fish to a series of toxicant concentrations that differed by 60% between treatments, and a control. For large, advanced fry, duplicate sets of jars were used and only 5 fish were stocked in each jar to maintain loading densities of 0.8 g/L or lower. Observations of mortality and abnormal behavioral responses were made at 24-hour intervals, and all dead fish were removed after each observation. In 1 set of tests, 2 life stages of Chinook salmon and Coho salmon were tested with boric acid. One life stage composed of swim-up fry 8-12 weeks old (post hatch) tested in fresh water. The 2nd life stage composed of advanced fry 15-21 weeks old tested in brackish water. Chinook salmon were also tested in soft water. In tests conducted in the 2 site-specific waters, pH was measured at the beginning and end of the test. Eyed eggs, alevins, and swim-up fry of Chinook salmon were tested in soft water to determine the relative sensitivity of those various life stages to boron. ...Groups of 25 eggs, 10 alevins, or 10 swim-up fry were exposed to a series of toxicant concentrations that differed by 56% between treatments, and a control. Criteria of death for eggs were the presence of an opaque (whitened) membrane. Alevins were examined under 30x magnification for the absence of a heartbeat, which was the criterion for death. The 24-hr LC50 of Chinook and Coho salmon (fresh or brackish water) was >1000 mg/L. Boron was relatively non-toxic. Young Coho salmon tested in fresh water were less tolerant than older fish tested in brackish water and Chinook salmon tested in either dilution water. The relative sensitivity of various early life stages of Chinook salmon to boron changed significantly as the fish developed. Fry were consistently more sensitive than either the embryos or alevins to boron. The pH in test concentrations and controls were not markedly different, ranging from 6.5 to 8.1. No significant differences in 96-hr LC50 values were found among dilution water qualities, thus indicating that differences in water quality characteristics tested did not modify the toxicity of these chemicals.",

At the end of the test there was 0% survival at 1000 mg/L, 10% survival at 100 mg/L, and 100% survival at all lower concentrations. ...Water quality parameters were within acceptable limits throughout the study. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were always above 7.8 mg/L. During the test, the mean temperature was 24.4 \u00b0C, the mean conductivity was 350 umhos/cm, and the pH ranged from 7.1 to 8.3. Hardness ranged from 88 to 100 mg/L in control vessels and from 88 to 108 mg/L in vessels containing 100 mg/L of the test substance. Alkalinity ranged from 16 to 21 mg/L in control vessels and from 16 to 23 mg/L in vessels containing 100 mg/L of the test substance. The percentage of surviving adults was not significantly reduced at any tested concentration, and sublethal effects were not observed at any concentration. The mean number of young per surviving adult was significantly lower than the control at the 3 highest tested concentrations (25, 50, and 100 mg/L). The most sensitive biological endpoint was production of young. The NOEC, LOEC, and MATC were 12.5, 25, and 17.7 mg/L, respectively.",

Atmospheric emissions of boric acid in particulate and vapor form occur as a result of volatilization of boric acid from the sea and volcanic activity; seawater evaporation is the biggest contribution in air. Boric acid's production and use in a wide variety of consumer and commercial products and applications may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. It's use as a crosslinking agent and friction reducer in hydraulic fracturing fluids and its use as an active registered pesticide will result in its direct release to the environment. Atmospheric emissions of boric acid occur as a result of mining operations, glass and ceramics manufacturing, the application of agricultural chemicals, and coal-fired power plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.6X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates boric acid will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase boric acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 38 days. Particulate-phase boric acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, the pKa of boric acid, 9.24 at 25 deg, indicates this compound will exist primarily in the undissociated form at an environmental pH range between pH 5 and pH 9, although the anion form will partially exist in alkaline soils(SRC). Adsorption of boron in soils depends on pH, organic content and types of clay and minerals in the soil. At acidic pH, boron exists in solutions in the form of undissociated boric acid; at alkaline pH, presence of borate ion occurs, which reaches maximum adsorption at pH 8.5-9. Field studies have observed boron to leach readily in soil; undissociated boric acid is transported in soil with little adsorption. Volatilization of boric acid from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-12 atm-cu m/mole, based upon its vapor pressure, 1.6X10-6 mm Hg, and water solubility, 5X10+4 mg/L. Boric acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. No biotransformation processes have been reported for boron compounds, including boric acid. If released into water, boric acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its observed leaching in soil. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. However, evaporation of seawater itself is reported to be the biggest environmental contribution of boric acid to air. Occupational exposures to boron compounds (including boric acid) occurs through inhalation of dusts and dermal absorption. The general population is exposed to boric acid in various cosmetic products, including make-up, skin and hair care preparations, deodorants, moisturizing creams, breath fresheners, and shaving creams.

Boric acid leaches readily in soils(2) which indicates adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in water will not be an important fate process(SRC). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-12 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 1.6X10-6 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 5X10+4 mg/L(5). However, evaporation of seawater itself is reported to be the biggest environmental contribution of boric acid to air(2). No biotransformation processes have been reported for boron compounds, including boric acid(2).",

One monitoring study found that approximately 90% of boric acid in the atmosphere is in gaseous form and 10% in particulate form(3). Vapor-phase boric acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 38 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.2X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(4). Particulate-phase boric acid may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The compound was added to 100 mL flasks corresponding to a boron concentration range of zero to 256 mg/L. It was observed that kaollinite adsorbed about 40 times (Kd = 0.199 (Freundlich adsorption coefficient)) more boric acid than illinite (Kd = 0.005) at pH 7; five times as much boric acid adsorbed to activated sludge (Kd = 0.025) as to illinite at pH 7(1). Boron adsorption is influenced by the distribution of boron species (H3BO3; B(OH)4(-)) as well as pH, the type and/or composition of the solution matrix, and surface properties(2). The pKa of boric acid is 9.24(3), indicating that this compound will exist primarily in the undissociated form in the environment, but partially in the anion form in alkaline soils(SRC). However, boric acid is a Lewis acid and therefore behaves as an electron acceptor, rather than a proton donor(3).",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

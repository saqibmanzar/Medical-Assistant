PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Since cumene hydroperoxide, as a tertiary alkyl hydroperoxide, is much more stable than ethylbenzene hydroperoxide, the oxidation can be taken to a higher conversion with still reasonable selectivity. Usually the conversion is limited to around 20%, leading to selectivities to cumene hydroperoxide in the range of 90-95%.",

The explosion was violent enough to completely shatter the ceramic top of a magnetic stir plate. Modifications of the published procedure (\"Purification of Laboratory Chemicals,\" D. D. Perrin, W. L. F. Armarego, and D. R. Perrin, 2nd Ed.) were used and involved washing the sodium salt of the hydroperoxide with toluene rather than benzene and drying the hexane extracts of the cumene hydroperoxide over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The magnesium sulfate had been removed by filtration, and the hexane was evaporated under vacuum at ambient temperature when the flask exploded. Most of the hexane appeared to have been removed because the residue in the flask was quite viscous. The cumene hydroperoxide was probably present in very high concentration, with little hexane remaining just before the explosion. All other aspects of the procedure were identical to those published in the book cited.  The exact cause of the explosion is not known. The only modification of the procedure that could possibly be connected to the explosion is the use of magnesium sulfate. It does not seem likely that substituting toluene for benzene would have any effect. This modified procedure has been used many times by several researchers in our laboratories with no problems; however, the incident serves as a poignant reminder of the sensitive nature of hydroperoxides, even those hydroperoxides known to be thermally quite stable, such as cumene hydroperoxide.  Cumene hydroperoxide at 0.2 M concentration in benzene is thermally stable with a half-life of 29 hours at 145 \u00b0C. The material, as it is purchased, is often listed as 80% cumene hydroperoxide. We know from analysis that the impurities are decomposition products of cumene hydroperoxide (alpha- methyl styrene, acetophenone, and cumyl alcohol). Many vendors warn that in the concentrated state, as purchased, cumene hydroperoxide should be stored at temperatures below 80 \u00b0C. The thermal data on hydroperoxides can be misleading and lull one into a false sense of security. The literature is full of examples showing that cumene, as well as other hydroperoxides, can undergo rapid decomposition at room temperature with a wide range of compounds, even when these compounds are present in trace or catalytic concentrations (acids and metal are examples). If one happens to be purifying a relatively large quantity of the hydroperoxide in a neat or concentrated state, the potential for an uncontrolled reaction and explosion is high.  During a purification procedure, there are many opportunities to inadvertently introduce small amounts of materials that may prove to be active catalysts for hydroperoxide decomposition. This can occur even when using well-established purification procedures. We recommend staying with the published procedures and not using active drying agents such as magnesium sulfate. The drying agent could contain traces of unidentified materials that may catalyze decomposition of the hydroperoxide. We also recommend purifying small quantities of cumene hydroperoxide (<5 g) and using it immediately. One should also take advantage of all available protective measures. Such measures include keeping the hood clear of any other flammable or potentially dangerous materials during purification. This precaution helps to avoid the possibility of secondary accidents being initiated by the uncontrolled reaction of the hydroperoxide during purification. Safety visor, apron, and heavy gloves should also be worn and explosion-proof shields used.",

Loss of refrigeration systems for an \"extended\" period of time can result in massive decomposition and fire in peroxide storage tanks. This is where things went wrong at the Arkema Corporation Plant that manufactures a large number of liquid organic peroxides in Crosby, Texas. Hurricane Harvey flooded this Plant where over one half million pounds of peroxides were stored.  Water destroyed the plant's electrical systems and backups thus shutting down refrigeration. \"Fearing that the chemicals might explode the Arkema workers, as a last resort, transferred the peroxides to nine refrigerated trailers on the property.  All but one of the refrigeration units on those trailers eventually failed, the company said.\" Out of fear of explosions the workers had to abandon the plant on August 29, resolved to allow explosions take place and peroxides burn. A perimeter of 1.5 miles around the plant was evacuated due to the various hazards. As time passed trailers warmed up and they exploded one by one and caught fire. Billowing thick black smoke and noxious gases were released every time a tanker exploded and burnt.  Scores of police officers and others were sent to hospital.",

The explosion was violent enough to completely shatter the ceramic top of a magnetic stir plate. Modifications of the published procedure (\"Purification of Laboratory Chemicals,\" D. D. Perrin, W. L. F. Armarego, and D. R. Perrin, 2nd Ed.) were used and involved washing the sodium salt of the hydroperoxide with toluene rather than benzene and drying the hexane extracts of the cumene hydroperoxide over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The magnesium sulfate had been removed by filtration, and the hexane was evaporated under vacuum at ambient temperature when the flask exploded. Most of the hexane appeared to have been removed because the residue in the flask was quite viscous. The cumene hydroperoxide was probably present in very high concentration, with little hexane remaining just before the explosion. All other aspects of the procedure were identical to those published in the book cited.  The exact cause of the explosion is not known. The only modification of the procedure that could possibly be connected to the explosion is the use of magnesium sulfate. It does not seem likely that substituting toluene for benzene would have any effect. This modified procedure has been used many times by several researchers in our laboratories with no problems; however, the incident serves as a poignant reminder of the sensitive nature of hydroperoxides, even those hydroperoxides known to be thermally quite stable, such as cumene hydroperoxide.  Cumene hydroperoxide at 0.2 M concentration in benzene is thermally stable with a half-life of 29 hours at 145 \u00b0C. The material, as it is purchased, is often listed as 80% cumene hydroperoxide. We know from analysis that the impurities are decomposition products of cumene hydroperoxide (alpha methyl styrene, acetophenone, and cumyl alcohol). Many vendors warn that in the concentrated state, as purchased, cumene hydroperoxide should be stored at temperatures below 80 \u00b0C. The thermal data on hydroperoxides can be misleading and lull one into a false sense of security. The literature is full of examples showing that cumene, as well as other hydroperoxides, can undergo rapid decomposition at room temperature with a wide range of compounds, even when these compounds are present in trace or catalytic concentrations (acids and metal are examples). If one happens to be purifying a relatively large quantity of the hydroperoxide in a neat or concentrated state, the potential for an uncontrolled reaction and explosion is high. During a purification procedure, there are many opportunities to inadvertently introduce small amounts of materials that may prove to be active catalysts for hydroperoxide decomposition. This can occur even when using well-established purification procedures. We recommend staying with the published procedures and not using active drying agents such as magnesium sulfate. The drying agent could contain traces of unidentified materials that may catalyze decomposition of the hydroperoxide.  We also recommend purifying small quantities of cumene hydroperoxide (<5 g) and using it immediately. One should also take advantage of all available protective measures. Such measures include keeping the hood clear of any other flammable or potentially dangerous materials during purification. This precaution helps to avoid the possibility of secondary accidents being initiated by the uncontrolled reaction of the hydroperoxide during purification. Safety visor, apron, and heavy gloves should also be worn and explosion-proof shields used.",

It is used in production of acetone and phenol; as polymerization catalyst, particularly in the redox systems, used for rapid polymerization. HUMAN STUDIES: Normal human epidermal keratinocytes undergo profound lipid oxidation with preference for phosphatidylserine followed by phosphatidylserine externalization upon exposure to cumene hydroperoxide. ANIMAL STUDIES: Application of 1-2 drops of cumene hydroperoxide (73%) to rabbit skin (circular area, 2 cm diameter) produced erythema, edema, and vesiculation within 2-3 days. 1 mg applied to the eye of rabbits caused redness of palpebral conjunctiva and chemosis. Skin carcinoma formed in DMBA/cumene peroxide-exposed mice in initiation/promotion study. Mutagenic activity of cumene hydroperoxide was observed in the Drosophila melanogaster test. Cumene hydroperoxide was evaluated for mutagenicity in the Salmonella microsome preincubation assay. Cumene hydroperoxide was tested in as many as 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100) in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Cumene hydroperoxide was positive in the Ames test with the last positive dose tested 33 ug/plate. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Toxic action of water pollutants was tested by measuring the immobilization of Daphnia magna, strain ircha. The mean effective concentration (EC50) for cumene hydroperoxide was less than 10 mg/L.",

Myrica nagi, a subtropical shrub, has been shown to possess significant activity against hepatotoxicity and other pharmacological and physiological disorders. We have shown a chemopreventive effect of Myrica nagi on cumene hydroperoxide-induced cutaneous oxidative stress and toxicity in mice. Cumene hydroperoxide treatment at a dose level of 30 mg/animal/0.2 mL acetone enhances susceptibility of cutaneous microsomal membrane for iron-ascorbate-induced lipid peroxidation and induction of xanthine oxidase activity which are accompanied by decrease in the activities of cutaneous antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and depletion in the level of cutaneous glutathione. Parallel to these changes a sharp decrease in the activities of phase II metabolizing enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase has been observed. Application of Myrica nagi at doses of 2.0 mg and 4.0 mg/kg body weight in acetone prior to that of cumene hydroperoxide (30 mg/animal/0.2 mL acetone) treatment resulted in significant inhibition of cumene hydroperoxide-induced cutaneous oxidative stress and toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Enhanced susceptibility of cutaneous microsomal membrane for lipid peroxidation induced by iron ascorbate and xanthine oxidase activities were significantly reduced (p<0.05). In addition the depleted level of glutathione, the inhibited activities of antioxidants, and phase II metabolizing enzymes were recovered to a significant level (p<0.05). The protective effect of Myrica nagi was dose-dependent. In summary our data suggest that Myrica nagi is an effective chemopreventive agent in skin and capable of ameliorating cumene hydroperoxide-induced cutaneous oxidative stress and toxicity.",

Our results showed that the pretreatment with an iron chelator (dipyridyl) protects all the tested strains against CHP toxic effects, but it was not sufficient to abolish the CHP induced mutagenesis. On the other hand, simultaneous pretreatment with both dipyridyl and neocuproine (copper chelator) leads to a complete protection against CHP mutagenic effects. Our data suggest the participation of copper ion in the CHP mutagenesis induced in E. coli.",

Free radical production is considered to be one of the key factors contributing to skin tumor promotion by organic peroxides. In vitro experiments have demonstrated metal-catalyzed formation of alkoxyl, alkyl, and aryl radicals in keratinocytes incubated with cumene hydroperoxide. The present study investigated in vivo free radical generation in lipid extracts of mouse skin exposed to cumene hydroperoxide. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping technique was used to detect the formation of alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) radical adducts, following intradermal injection of 180 mg/kg PBN. It was found that 30 min after topical exposure, cumene hydroperoxide (12 mmol/kg) induced free radical generation in the skin of female Balb/c mice kept for 10 weeks on vitamin E-deficient diets. In contrast, hardly discernible radical adducts were detected when cumene hydroperoxide was applied to the skin of mice fed a vitamin E-sufficient diet. Importantly, total antioxidant reserve and levels of GSH, ascorbate, and vitamin E decreased 34%, 46.5%. 27%, and 98%, respectively, after mice were kept for 10 weeks on vitamin E-deficient diet. PBN adducts detected by ESR in vitamin E-deficient mice provide direct evidence for in vivo free radical generation in the skin after exposure to cumene hydroperoxide.",

In this communication, we have shown the modulating effect of H. indicus on cumene hydroperoxide-mediated cutaneous oxidative stress and tumor promotion response in murine skin. Cumene hydroperoxide treatment (30 mg per animal) increased cutaneous microsomal lipid peroxidation and induction of xanthine oxidase activity which are accompanied by decrease in the activities of cutaneous antioxidant enzymes and depletion in the level of glutathione. Parallel to these changes a sharp decrease in the activities of phase II metabolizing enzymes was observed. Cumene hydroperoxide treatment also induced the ornithine decarboxylase activity and enhanced the [(3)H]-thymidine uptake in DNA synthesis in murine skin.  Application of ethanolic extract of H. indicus at a dose level of 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg body weight in acetone prior to that of cumene hydroperoxide treatment resulted in significant inhibition of cumene hydroperoxide-induced cutaneous oxidative stress, epidermal ornithine decarboxylase activity and enhanced DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Enhanced susceptibility of cutaneous microsomal membrane for lipid peroxidation and xanthine oxidase activity were significantly reduced (p<0.01). In addition the depleted level of glutathione, inhibited activities of antioxidants and phase II metabolizing enzymes were recovered to significant level (p<0.05). In summary, our data suggest that H. indicus is an effective chemopreventive agent in skin and capable of ameliorating hydroperoxide-induced cutaneous oxidative stress and tumor promotion.",

Lipid peroxidation is of fundamental interest in the cellular response to peroxides, as lipids are extremely sensitive to oxidation and lipid-based signaling systems have been implicated in a number of cellular processes, including apoptosis. Oxidation of specific phospholipid classes was measured in normal human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to cumene hydroperoxide after metabolic incorporation of the fluorescent oxidation-sensitive fatty acid, cis-parinaric acid, using a fluorescence high-performance liquid chromatography assay. In addition, lipid oxidation was correlated with changes in membrane phospholipid asymmetry and other markers of apoptosis. Although cumene hydroperoxide produced significant oxidation of cis-parinaric acid in all phospholipid classes, one phospholipid, phosphatidylserine, appeared to be preferentially oxidized above all other species. Using fluorescamine derivatization and annexin V binding, it was observed that specific oxidation of phosphatidylserine was accompanied by phosphatidylserine translocation from the inner to the outer plasma membrane surface where it may serve as a recognition signal for interaction with phagocytic macrophages. These effects occurred much earlier than any detectable changes in other apoptotic markers such as caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, or changes in nuclear morphology. Thus, normal human epidermal keratinocytes undergo profound lipid oxidation with preference for phosphatidylserine followed by phosphatidylserine externalization upon exposure to cumene hydroperoxide. It is, therefore, likely that normal human epidermal keratinocytes exposed to similar oxidative stress in vivo would undergo phosphatidylserine oxidation/translocation. This would make them targets for macrophage recognition and phagocytosis, and thus limit their potential to invoke inflammation or give rise to neoplastic transformations.",

Clinical observations of animals in the 124 mg/cu m dose group at 12 days included eye and nose irritation, breathing difficulties, and decreased body weights. Pathological observations attributed to the effect of the test article in animals that died or were sacrificed in the 124 mg/cu m dose group included ulceration and inflammation of the cornea, nasal turbinates and lining of the stomach; while observations of thymic atrophy, depletion of lymphoid tissue in the germinal centers of some lymph nodes and the spleen, decreased lipid content of the liver, and decreased circulating white blood cells, were attributed to stress. Hematological observations in the 124 mg/cu m dose group included a generalized decrease in PCV, RBC and WBC count and a decrease in hemoglobin levels.

Rehydration is critical for lichens, a burst of free radicals involving NO occurs. Repeated dehydrations with organic pollutants could increase oxidative damage. Our aim is to learn the effects of cumene hydroperoxide (CP) during lichen rehydration using Ramalina farinacea (L.) Ach., its photobiont Trebouxia spp. and Asterochloris erici. Confocal imaging shows intracellular ROS and NO production within myco and phycobionts, being the chloroplast the main source of free radicals. CP increases ROS, NO and lipid peroxidation and reduces chlorophyll autofluorescence, although photosynthesis remains unaffected. Concomitant NO inhibition provokes a generalized increase of ROS and a decrease in photosynthesis. Our results suggest that CP induces a compensatory hormetic response in Ramalina farinacea that could reduce the lichen's antioxidant resources after repeated desiccation-rehydration cycles. NO is important in the protection from CP.",

In this study, we investigated the response of Sf9 cells (derived from ovaries of Spodoptera frugiperda; order Lepidoptera) to cumene hydroperoxide (CHPx), compared to human BMG-1 cells. CHPx treatment at doses lethal for human cells also caused typical necrosis in Sf9. Severe necrosis in human BMG-1 cells was observed at 125 uM, whereas similar effect in Sf9 cells was observed at 250 uM. In Sf9 cells, CHPx (250 uM) induced negligible changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular reactive oxygen species, while moderate effect was observed on intracellular calcium distribution. Reduced DNA damage and lipid (including cardiolipin) oxidation was observed in Sf9 cells that could be due to moderate total antioxidant status and constitutive/induced glutathione S-transferase activity. This study importantly demonstrates that Lepidopteran insect cells having extensive resistance towards DNA damaging agents show only moderately higher resistance to membrane damaging agents. A stronger reducing environment involving efficient antioxidant system seems to contribute significantly in this response.",

Small quantities might be formed in the atmosphere and natural waters from cumene. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.27X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cumene hydroperoxide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cumene hydroperoxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 45 hours. If released to soil, cumene hydroperoxide is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.7X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Cumene hydroperoxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. Hydroperoxides react with a variety of compounds and are degraded readily to the corresponding alcohols. If released into water, is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant.

Volatilization of cumene hydroperoxide from moist soil surfaces is not expected(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.7X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 3.27X10-3 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 13,900 mg/L(4). Cumene hydroperoxide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(3). A 0% of Theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(5) suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). However, hydroperoxides react with a variety of compounds and are reduced readily to the corresponding alcohols(6). They are decomposed readily by multivalent metal ions, are photo- and thermally-sensitive and undergo initial oxygen-oxygen bond homolysis, and they are readily attacked by free radicals, undergoing induced and self-induced decomposition(6). Therefore, chemical degradation is expected to be the dominant fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.7X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.27X10-3 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 13,900 mg/L(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 12(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.16(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Biodegradation in water is not expected based on a 0% biodegradation using the Japanese MITI test(7). However, hydroperoxides react with a variety of compounds and are reduced readily to the corresponding alcohols(8). They are decomposed readily by multivalent metal ions, are photo- and thermally sensitive and undergo initial oxygen-oxygen bond homolysis, and they are readily attacked by free radicals, undergoing induced and self-induced decomposition(8). Therefore, chemical degradation is expected to be the dominant fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil. They can occur in the air, either attached to dust particles or as solids in soil or sediment. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

The analytical technique utilized reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for separation of individual PAH, with fluorescence detection, which is sensitive and specific. A specific sample cleanup was employed prior to measurement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, designed to provide a fraction enriched in PAH & free from the biologic matirx. Sample extracts, in 0.5 mL hexane, were applied to a silica gel column (0.8X10 cm, 1.4 g) topped with 0.5 cm sodium sulfate. A 4 mL hexane fraction was discarded, and a second fraction of 13 mL cyclohexane was collected and concentrated under dry nitrogen to about 0.1 mL. In six serum samples, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were below the limit of detection (1-60 pg/mL). /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

B(b)F is a component of coal tar pitch used in industry as a binder for electrodes. It is also a component of creosote, which is used to preserve wood. B(b)F has some use as a research chemical. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Acute toxicity is rarely reported. Exposure to high-risk polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by skin and lung absorption results in increased incidences of skin and lung cancer. Coke oven emissions are complex mixtures of coal and coke material that include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, an epidemiological study of exposed workers indicated increased incidences of lung and urinary tract cancer. Soots, tars, and creosote contain a variety of by-products and contaminants that include PAHs, an epidemiological study demonstrates increased incidences of skin, lung, bladder and gastrointestinal cancer. B(b)F is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. ANIMAL STUDIES: Benzo(b)fluoranthene produced tumors in mice after lung implantation, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous injection, and skin painting. Dermal application of benzo[b]fluoranthene caused skin tumors, and subcutaneous injection of benzo[b]fluoranthene caused cancer at the injection site (sarcoma). Benzo[b]fluoranthene caused lung cancer (carcinoma) in female rats exposed by intrapulmonary implantation. Intraperitoneal injection of benzo[b]fluoranthene caused benign lung tumors (adenoma) in male mice (a strain with a high spontaneous incidence of lung cancer) and benign or malignant liver tumors (hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma) in newborn male mice. Maternal B[b]F exposure disturbed normal sperm function in F1 offspring. Benzo(b)fluoranthene was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium at a concentration of 100 ug/plate in strain TA100 and at 7 nmole/plate in strain TA98 with an exogenous metabolic system. Benzo(b)fluoranthene showed sister chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster bone marrow cells following two doses of 450 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Some of the most toxic PAHs of crude oil can be bioaccumulated in gelatinous zooplankton and potentially be transferred up the food web and contaminate apex predators. Chronic exposures to sediment-bound PAHs may induce lesions in gills in marine fish.",

Precision-cut rat liver slices were incubated with benzo[a]pyrene alone or in combination with a range of concentrations of a second PAH, and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA levels determined. Concurrent incubation of benzo[a]pyrene with either dibenzo[a,h]anthracene or fluoranthene in liver slices led to a synergistic interaction, at least at low concentrations, in that ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity was statistically higher than the added effects when the slices were incubated with the individual compounds. In contrast, benzo[b]fluoranthene and, at high doses only, dibenzo[a,l]pyrene gave rise to antagonism, whereas 1-methylphenanthrene had no effect at all concentrations studied. When CYP1A1 mRNA levels were monitored, benzo[b]fluoranthene gave rise to an antagonistic response when incubated with benzo[a]pyrene, whereas all other compounds displayed synergism, with 1-methylphenathrene being the least effective. A similar picture emerged when CYP1B1 mRNA levels were determined, though the effects were less pronounced. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the benzo[a]pyrene-mediated upregulation of CYP1, at the mRNA and activity levels, is synergistically and antagonistically modulated by other PAHs.",

The effects of benzo[a]pyrene or dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DB[a,h]A) alone and in binary mixtures with another PAH (DB[a,h]A, benzo[b]fluoranthene, fluoranthene or dibenzo[a,l]pyrene) were investigated using precision-cut rat liver slices. All compounds significantly modulated the expression of several genes, but overlap between genes affected by the mixture and by the individual compounds was relatively small. All mixtures showed an antagonistic response on total gene expression profiles. Moreover, at the level of individual genes, mostly antagonism was evident, with additivity and synergism observed for only a few genes. As far as DNA adduct formation is concerned, the binary mixtures generally caused antagonism. The effects in liver slices suggest a lower carcinogenic potency of PAH mixtures than estimated based on additivity of individual compounds.",

The present work aimed at understanding the interaction effects of two model PAHs, the potentially carcinogenic benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F) and the noncarcinogenic phenanthrene (Phe) to a marine fish (the sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax). The study endeavoured an ecologically-relevant scenario with respect to concentrations and contaminant matrix, sediments, which are the main reservoirs of these substances in the environment, due to their hydrophobic nature. For the purpose, 28-day laboratorial bioassays with spiked sediments (with individual and combined PAHs at equitoxic concentrations) were conducted. Genotoxicity was determined in peripheral blood through the \"Comet\" assay and by scoring erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA). The results showed that exposure to either PAHs induced similar levels of DNA strand breaks, although without a clear dose- or time-response, likely due to the low concentrations of exposure and potential shits in PAH bioavailability during the assays. However, clastogenic/aneugenic lesions were only observed in fish exposed to B[b]F-spiked sediments. Conversely, the combination assays revealed a supra-additive effect especially at chromosome level, linked to concentrations of PAHs in water. A decrease in DNA-strand breakage was observed over time during all assays, revealing some ability of fish to cope with this DNA lesion. Overall, the findings show that low-moderate concentrations of sediment-bound mixed PAHs may significantly increase the hazard of mutagenesis even when the individual concentrations indicate low risk, especially considering that chromosome-level damage is unlikely to be repaired, leading to the fixation of DNA lesions upon prolonged exposures.",

The present work aimed at understanding the interaction effects between carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic PAHs in a model marine fish (Dicentrarchus labrax) in realistic scenarios. Laboratory assays under ecologically-relevant parameters were conducted for 28 days with sediments spiked with low-moderate concentrations (250-800 ng/g) of two model PAHs, phenanthrene (non-carcinogenic) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (carcinogenic to experimental animals). Both PAHs induced hepatic histopathological changes that indicate metabolic failure and inflammation, especially in animals exposed to mixtures. Phenanthrene elicited biochemical changes better related to oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, glutathione and glutathione S-transferase activity) and CYP function, whereas B[b]F disrupted metabolic responses and defenses to toxicological challenge. Conversely, mixed PAHs yielded lesions and responses that, altogether, are compatible with the AHR dependent pathway (the basis of PAH mutagenicity), potentially generating supra-additive effects. Nonetheless, the low, ecologically-relevant, concentrations of PAHs diluted dose and time-response relations. Overall, although seemingly predicting the risk of individual PAHs, environmental guidelines may not apply to mixtures by underestimating adverse effects, which calls for a redefinition of standards when determining the true risk of toxicants under realistic circumstances.",

In this study, we evaluated how particulate PAHs modulated the formation of DNA damage induced by carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Single strand breaks and alkali labile sites, as well as BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA adducts were measured in the competent HepG2 cells by Comet assay and HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. B[a]P, alone or in binary mixture with other PAHs (1 uM each), led to low amounts of strand breaks. In contrast, formation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adducts was significant and found to be enhanced in HepG2 co-treated for 14 hr by B[a]P in the presence of either benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DB[a,h]A) or indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP). Opposite results were obtained with benzo[k]fluoranthene (B[k]F). The same observations were made when cells were pre-incubated with PAH before incubation with B[a]P. These results show that the interactions between PAHs are not direct competition reactions. Emphasis was then placed on the modulation of B[a]P-induced DNA damage by B[b]F and B[k]F. No difference in the time-course formation of DNA damage was observed. However, dose-response relationship differed between these two PAHs with a concentration-dependent inhibition of BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA by B[k]F whereas a constant level of potentiation for B[b]F was observed for concentrations higher than 1 uM. Altogether, these results show that the genotoxicity of B[a]P in binary mixtures with other carcinogenic PAH may be modulated. In such cases, a potentiation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adduct formation is most often observed with exception of B[k]F. Several biological mechanisms may account for these observations, including binding of PAHs to the Ah receptor (AhR), their affinity toward CYP450 and competition for metabolism. These different interactions have to be considered when addressing the intricate issue of the toxicity of mixtures.",

They are reported to alter trophoblast proliferation in placenta, in addition to disturbing its endocrine functions, which may be able to increase the risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women. The present study was planned to assess possible involvement of PAHs exposure of pregnant women (measured as placental PAHs concentrations) with preterm delivery cases among women of Lucknow city (India). We performed a case-control study and a total of 60 mothers (n=31 full term and n=29 preterm deliveries) were recruited at a local nursing home of Lucknow, for the period of August 2005-February 2006. Subsequent to parturition, placental tissues from each participant were immediately collected and kept at -20 degrees C until PAHs analyses. Placental tissue PAHs concentrations were determined by HPLC, using a fluorescence detector. Mean+/-SD placental level (61.91+/-12.43 ppb) of benzo(b)fluoranthene, a carcinogenic PAH, was found significantly elevated (p<0.05) among women with preterm delivery when compared with the level (23.84+/-7.01) in women having full-term deliveries. In the same way, non-carcinogenic fluoranthene level (325.91+/-45.14 ppb) was also detected to be higher in the preterm delivery group compared to 208.6+/-21.93 ppb level from the full-term delivery group of women. Additionally naphthalene, acenaphthylene, phenanthrene, anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene levels in placental tissue were also found to be higher in the preterm delivery group of women but the difference did not reach statistically significant levels. This foremost study from India with modest samples size and limited statistical power does not show a substantial involvement of PAHs with preterm delivery, but higher concentrations of placental PAHs detected among preterm delivery group of women could show some possible association with these environmental toxicants. Further study with large sample size, controlled for confounders and great statistical power, is reasonable to elucidate the association of PAHs exposure with preterm delivery of women in India.",

We evaluated the relationship between residential carpet dust PAH concentrations (benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-c,d)pyrene, and their sum) and risk of NHL (676 cases, 511 controls) in the National Cancer Institute Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results multicenter case-control study. As a secondary aim, we investigated determinants of dust PAH concentrations. We computed odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for associations between NHL and concentrations of individual and summed PAHs using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, and study center. Determinants of natural log-transformed PAHs were investigated using multivariate least-squares regression. We observed some elevated risks for NHL overall and B cell lymphoma subtypes in association with quartiles or tertiles of PAH concentrations, but without a monotonic trend, and there was no association comparing the highest quartile or tertile to the lowest. In contrast, risk of T cell lymphoma was significantly increased among participants with the highest tertile of summed PAHs (OR = 3.04; 95 % CI, 1.09-8.47) and benzo(k)fluoranthene (OR = 3.20; 95 % CI, 1.13-9.11) compared with the lowest tertile. Predictors of PAH dust concentrations in homes included ambient air PAH concentrations and the proportion of developed land within 2 km of a residence. Older age, more years of education, and white race were also predictive of higher levels in homes. Our results suggest a potential link between PAH exposure and risk of T cell lymphoma and demonstrate the importance of analyzing risk by NHL histologic type.",

In this study, we evaluated how particulate PAHs modulated the formation of DNA damage induced by carcinogenic benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). Single strand breaks and alkali labile sites, as well as BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA adducts were measured in the competent HepG2 cells by Comet assay and HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. B[a]P, alone or in binary mixture with other PAHs (1 uM each), led to low amounts of strand breaks. In contrast, formation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adducts was significant and found to be enhanced in HepG2 co-treated for 14 hr by B[a]P in the presence of either benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), dibenz[a,h]anthracene (DB[a,h]A) or indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP). Opposite results were obtained with benzo[k]fluoranthene (B[k]F). The same observations were made when cells were pre-incubated with PAH before incubation with B[a]P. These results show that the interactions between PAHs are not direct competition reactions. Emphasis was then placed on the modulation of B[a]P-induced DNA damage by B[b]F and B[k]F. No difference in the time-course formation of DNA damage was observed. However, dose-response relationship differed between these two PAHs with a concentration-dependent inhibition of BPDE-N2-dGuo DNA by B[k]F whereas a constant level of potentiation for B[b]F was observed for concentrations higher than 1 uM. Altogether, these results show that the genotoxicity of B[a]P in binary mixtures with other carcinogenic PAH may be modulated. In such cases, a potentiation of BPDE-N2-dGuo adduct formation is most often observed with exception of B[k]F. Several biological mechanisms may account for these observations, including binding of PAHs to the Ah receptor (AhR), their affinity toward CYP450 and competition for metabolism. These different interactions have to be considered when addressing the intricate issue of the toxicity of mixtures.",

In the present study, human peripheral blood lymphocytes were exposed in vitro to different concentrations of PAHs with (+S9) or without (-S9) metabolic activation. The genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of each PAH were examined with an alkaline comet assay and trypan blue dye exclusion, and oxidative DNA damage was determined via the detection of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OhdG) adduct levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The DNA damage was evaluated with two genotoxicity parameters: the frequency of comets and the comet tail length. Concentrations of 20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 uM DB(a,h)A-S9; 20, 40, 80, 160 and 240 uM B(ghi)P-S9; 20, 30, 40, 60 and 80 uM B(b)F-S9; and 80 uM B(a)P-S9 for 24 hr induced a small but significant increase in the means of comet frequency, in the tail length and in the 8-oHDg levels in relation to the control (0.5% DMSO-S9). However, all PAHs+S9 produced a more significant increase in DNA strand breaks and the level of 8-OHdG compared with the control (0.5% DMSO+S9), with a concentration-effect relationship. The viability of lymphocytes exposed to all PAHs-S9 and PAHs+S9 was not modified compared with the control. The results of this study demonstrate that the comet and ELISA are rapid, suitable and sensitive methods to detect in vitro PAH-induced DNA damage in human peripheral lymphocytes.",

This was achieved by studying their lytic or antilytic effects on fish erythrocytes in critical hypotonic saline media. The interaction of PAHs acute potency divisor concentrations with mudskipper erythrocyte causes dramatic changes in the structure of the membrane. A significant difference (p<0.05) was found between the control and treatment groups of mudskipper erythrocyte exposed to acute potency divisor concentrations. No significant difference (p>0.05) was observed between the control and the treatment groups of mudskipper erythrocyte exposed to field concentrations. The results showed that chronic potency divisor concentrations of PAHs protect mudskipper erythrocyte against osmotic hemolysis. Our results could be extended to the use of Erythrocyte Osmotic Fragility (EOF) test as a biochemical marker of membrane toxicity in marine pollution biomonitoring. However, results showed that membrane stability is not an appropriate biomarker for PAHs pollution after short exposure duration.",

Laboratory bioassays with sediments spiked with phenanthrene (Phe) and benzo[b]fluoranthene (B[b]F), non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic PAH, respectively, were conducted and the effects of exposure (related to DNA damage and oxidative stress) were analyzed in the gills of a burrowing clam, Ruditapes decussatus (Bivalvia, Veneridae). To ensure ecological relevance, two contaminant concentrations (termed \"low\" and \"high\") were selected in accordance with available PAH sediment quality guidelines. The results showed that, even in \"low\" concentrations, both compounds caused a likely genotoxic effect in the gills, which is in accordance with the link between PAHs in water. Glutathione S-transferase activity and glutathione biosynthesis appear to be associated with limited lipid peroxidation even though they were insufficient to prevent higher and faster genotoxicity induced by exposure to the carcinogenic B[b]F, comparative to Phe. Overall the findings indicate that low concentrations of sediment-bound PAHs, carcinogenic or not, may be rendered significantly bioavailable to benthic filter-feeders as to induce genotoxicity, revealing that even PAHs considered non-carcinogenic to humans detain a latent, albeit significant, pro-mutagenic hazard to bivalve molluscs.",

We determined the effects of Louisiana light sweet crude oil exposure on survival and bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in adult stages of the scyphozoans Pelagia noctiluca and Aurelia aurita and the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, and on survival of ephyra larvae of A. aurita and cydippid larvae of M. leidyi, in the laboratory. Adult P. noctiluca showed 100% mortality at oil concentration >/= 20 uL/L after 16 hr. In contrast, low or non-lethal effects were observed on adult stages of A. aurita and M. leidyi exposed at oil concentration </= 25 uL/L after 6 days. Survival of ephyra and cydippid larva decreased with increasing crude oil concentration and exposition time. The median lethal concentration (LC50) for ephyra larvae ranged from 14.41 to 0.15 uL/L after 1 and 3 days, respectively. LC50 for cydippid larvae ranged from 14.52 to 8.94 uL/L after 3 and 6 days, respectively. We observed selective bioaccumulation of chrysene, phenanthrene and pyrene in A. aurita and chrysene, pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]anthracene in M. leidyi. Overall, our results indicate that (1) A. aurita and M. leidyi adults had a high tolerance to crude oil exposure compared to other zooplankton, whereas P. noctiluca was highly sensitive to crude oil, (2) larval stages of gelatinous zooplankton were more sensitive to crude oil than adult stages, and (3) some of the most toxic PAHs of crude oil can be bioaccumulated in gelatinous zooplankton and potentially be transferred up the food web and contaminate apex predators."

Benzo(b)fluoranthene has also been identified in cigarette smoke, unburnt coal and as a metabolic product in algae. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(b)fluoranthene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzo(b)fluoranthene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours. Particulate-phase benzo(b)fluoranthene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(b)fluoranthene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and has a direct photolysis half-life of about 9 hours when irradiated with light. If released to soil, benzo(b)fluoranthene is expected to have no mobility based upon a log Koc range of 6.80-7.96. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.57X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benzo(b)fluoranthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is expected to occur slowly in the environment with soil half-lives of several months to years. If released into water, benzo(b)fluoranthene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the log Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3000 in fish suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high; however, this compound may be metabolized by aquatic organisms. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure may be through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where coal and petroleum derived substances are produced or used or where combustion processes are extensive. The general population may be exposed to benzo(b)fluoranthene through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and the ingestion of food and water contaminated by combustion effluents.

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3000(SRC), from a log Kow of 5.78(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high.

Vapor-phase benzo(b)fluoranthene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase benzo(b)fluoranthene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benzo(b)fluoranthene contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and has a direct photolysis half-life of about 9 hours when irradiated with light(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in sewage sludge at 0.06-9.14 mg/kg (UK), <2 mg/kg (US) and 0.51-2.16 mg/kg (Germany)(3). Combined residues of benzo(b,j,k)fluoranthene isomers were detected in the emissions of diesel engines at 5 ng/cu m and gas engines at 7.6 ng/cu m(4). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in vehicle exhaust in Los Angeles, CA at 1.14-2.27 ng/cu m in samples collected Feb-Nov 1989(5). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in the effluent of wood fueled furnaces and cereal straw furnaces at 0.007-83.9 ug/cu m(6) and in the effluent of wood burning stoves at 0.016-1.10 mg/cu m(7). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in the ashes of pyrolyzed tires at concentrations of 70 and 88 mg/kg(8). The global and national (Turkey) emission of benzo(b)fluoranthene from electric arc furnaces used in steel plants was estimated respectively as 5600-21,800 and 230-900 kg/year, calculated from samples collected Apr 26 to May 7, 2007(9).

Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected, not quantified, in sediments from the Elizabeth River in Virginia(5). In sediment samples collected Oct 28 to Nov 6, 2002 from 19 locations on the lower Missouri River, benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected at 7.8-165 ng/g dry weight(6). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in sediment samples from seven locations on Lake Erie at not detected to 1.96 mg/kg; samples were collected in Aug 2006(7). Benzo(b,k)fluoranthene was detected in sediment samples from 114 sites from 8 historically contaminated locations in New York and North Carolina at 0.02-418 ug/g; samples were collected 2003 to 2005(8). Pore water concentrations of benzo(b,k)fluoranthene from 51 of these samples were not detected to 2.1 ng/g(8). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected at 13.2-71.9 ng/g dry weight in 24 samples collected Aug 16-19, 2011 from the southern part of Lake Michigan(9). Seven sediment samples collected in the vicinity of a former manufactured gas plant on the Hudson River, NY contained 5.1-56.3 mg/kg of benzo(b)fluoranthene; samples were collected in 2003(10).",

Wet and dry deposition of benzo(b)fluoranthene was reported at 12-58 and 3.5-29 ng/sq m/day, respectively; study was conducted on Mazzorbetto Island in the northern part of the Venetian lagoon, May to Nov 2005(3). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in 79% of house hold dust samples collected Feb 29 to Apr 11, 2004 from 24 homes in Kuwait at detection limit to 289 ng/g(4). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was not detected in 30 dust samples taken from the kitchens of wood, kerosene and butane gas cook systems(5). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected at 0.160-54.0 ug/g in vacuum cleaner dust samples collected Nov 2002 and Mar 2003 from 75 homes in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada(6). Unspecified benzofluoranthene isomers were 6-186 ppm and 20-81 ppm in soot from open fires of coal and wood, respectively.

Combined benzo(b,j)fluoranthene isomers were detected in breathing zones of two silicon carbide plants at 21-557 ng/cu m (near an oven), 23-794 ng/cu m (foremans work oven), 21-3,731 ng/cu m (oven workstations) and 11-1,775 ng/cu m (crane operations)(2). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in the breathing zones of an anode producing industrial plant at 0.01 ug/cu m(3). Benzo(b)fluoranthene was detected in the air of upper and lower floors of a Swedish alloy factory at an average of 230 and 140 ng/sample in samples collected Nov-Dec 2007 and at 260 and 260 ng/sample in samples collected Jan 2008(4). The general population may be exposed to benzo(b)fluoranthene through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and the ingestion of food and water contaminated by combustion effluents(SRC).",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The method is based on the ion-pair chromatographic separation of arsenic species and continuous hydride generation for the determination of arsenic in the chromatographic effluent by atomic absorption spectrometry. The chromatographic separation was completed within 4 min by using Bu4N+ in phosphate buffer as the ion-pairing agent and a C18 reversed-phase column. The detection limit was 4.7 ug/cu dm of arsenic dimethylarsinic acid. This detection limit is not low enough to detect the lowest levels of these arsenic species in the urine of unexposed subjects. However, accurate measurement of the concn due to occupational exposure is easily achieved.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Dissolves in water to yield solutions containing more hydrogen ions than pure water contains and so having a pH less than 7.0. Is neutralized exothermically by all bases to produce water plus a salt. Reacts (but usually slowly) with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for the solid acid but are quite slow if the solid acid remains dry. The solid may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Reacts with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat may be generated with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Also may react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still some heat. Can be oxidized exothermically by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents; a wide variety of products is possible. May initiate polymerization reactions; may catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Sodium cacodylate is found on List B. Case No: 2080; Pesticide type: Herbicide; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): Sodium cacodylate; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 06/07/91, 03/03/95, 10/13/95; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide has made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

Groups of male NMRI-mice and New Zealand rabbits were given intraperitoneal (ip) injections of 100 um periodate oxidized adenosine per kilogram (kg) 15 min before an intravenous injection of 0.04 mg/kg (74)As labeled arsenite or injections of (74)As labeled arsenite only. These animals were kept for 16 to 72 hr in metabolic cages designed to separate urine and feces. The urinary concn of dimethylarsenic acid (DMA), the major arsenic metabolite, was measured. Other groups of animals were injected with (74)As labeled arsenite and periodate oxidized adenosine or (74)As labeled arsenite only and killed between 1 to 72 hr. Blood, liver, kidney, lung, epididymis, and portions of skin were removed and measured for (74)As content in a gamma scintillation counter. Also, subcellular fractionation of liver tissue was performed and the concentration of (74)As was ascertained. The urinary excretion of (74)As was lower in mice and rabbits treated with periodate oxidized adenosine prior to arsenite administration than in animals treated with arsenite only. Injection of periodate oxidized adenosine prior to arsenite produced a 25 to 70% decrease in the production of dimethylarsenic acid, implying that S-adenosylmethionine was the methyl donor for the methylation of inorganic arsenic in vivo. The fecal excretion of (74)As was less than 4% of the dose, independent of treatment and animal species. Periodate oxidized adenosine treated animals had 2 to 6 times higher concentrations of (74)As in tissues than that in controls, the effect being first observed in liver tissues. The subcellular distribution of (74)As in liver of mice was not affected by periodate oxidized adenosine treatment in that 50% was found in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction and 20 to 30% was found in thenuclear fraction, independent of the treatment.",

Arsenic cmpd, which have been used as insecticides, exert their toxic effects by combining with sulfhydryl groups. The action of arsenicals on the muscarinic receptor from invertebrate and vertebrate species (locust and rat) was compared. Disulfide reducing reagents dithiothreitol and British Anti-Lewisite, but not arsenicals, inhibited (3)H quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. However, after disulfide reduction, arsenicals caused a further inhibition of muscarinic binding. The effect of dithiothreitol + arsenicals was largely irreversible. The locust receptors were more sensitive to the action of both disulfide reagents either in the absence or presence of arsenicals than the rat receptors. The sulfhydryl reagent p-chloromercuric benzoate was more effective at inhibiting the locust receptors than the rat receptors, but addition of arsenicals did not cause further inhibition in either the locust or rat receptors. In locust, dithiothreitol + cacodylate and dithiothreitol + arsenite caused a reduction in the number of sites without modifying the affinity of (3)H quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. In rat, dithiothreitol + arsenite caused a decrease in the affinity, while dithiothreitol + cacodylate caused a decrease in the affinity of (3)H quinuclidinyl benzilate binding and its number of sites. Competition experiments after dithiothreitol + cacodylate showed that the IC50 remained unchanged in the locust. In the rat, the IC50 for atropine was increased and increased for carbachol. These results are explained assuming that the binding site of the locust receptor has a disulfide group similar to that of the mammalian receptor, but that th hydrophobic interactions within the binding site are weaker in the locust receptor.",

The exposure to 10 mM dimethylarsinic acid for 10 hr caused significant single-strand breaks in DNA of the cells. At an earlier period of the exposure, the replicative DNA synthesis was markedly suppressed, and the chain length of the nascent DNA was shorter than that of the control, suggesting that the template DNA received some modification other than strand breaks. The modification, being repairable, was sensitive to UV irradiation to cause strand breaks.",

The four representative forms of arsenic tested were the organic cmpd methylarsonate and dimethylarsinate, and the inorganic cmpd m-arsenite and arsenate. Male ICR mice were administered doses of respective arsenic cmpd either orally or ip. Twenty-four hours later, livers were assayed for zinc concn by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Metallothionein determination was made by HPLC/atomic absorption spectrophotometry by cadmium displacement of zinc. The mortality rate of the mice within 24 hr of ip injection as a function of dose indicated that the inorganic arsenic cmpd were much more toxic than the organic arsenic cmpd. The inorganic cmpd also induced hepatic zinc-thionein at doses one order of magnitude lower than the organic cmpd. There were no significant differences in results between oral and ip administration. The coadministration of selenite and m-arsenite ip induced approximately one fifth as much hepatic zinc-thionein as selenite alone but a comparable amount to that of m-arsenite alone. It was concluded that hepatic zinc-thionein induction by the arsenic cmpd examined parallels their respective toxicities. Inhibition of selenite induction of zinc-thionein by m-arsenite could relate to the ability of arsenic and selenium to reduce each other's toxicity.",

Inorganic arsenic compounds in water or soil can undergo biochemical transformations that may result in the formation of dimethylarsenic acid. Dimethylarsenic acid is also formed in the ambient atmosphere by the oxidation of gaseous methylated arsines that are emitted to air as biological conversion products from bacteria and fungi. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.6X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethylarsenic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethylarsenic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 31 days. If released to soil, dimethylarsenic acid is expected to be tightly bound to soil and have low mobility. The pKa of dimethylarsenic acid is 1.57, indicating that this compound will exist as the anion in the environment. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because the anion is not expected to volatilize. Dimethylarsenic is expected to biodegrade in soil; incubation of dimethylarsenic acid in two soils for six weeks resulted in 4-43% degradation. If released into water, dimethylarsenic acid is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Dimethylarsenic acid is expected to biodegrade in water. In a die-away test using river sediments, the degradation half-life of dimethylarsenic acid was about 30 days. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because the anion is not expected to volatilize. A BCF of 21 for mosquito fish suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The organic functional groups of dimethylarsenic acid are generally resistant to aqueous environmental chemical hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to dimethylarsenic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethylarsenic acid is produced or used. Urinary excretion of arsenic has been directly correlated with worker exposure to dimethylarsenic acid. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dimethylarsenic acid via inhalation of ambient air containing methylated arsines. (SRC)",

Organoarsenicals, such as dimethylarsinic acid, are adsorbed by clays soils(1). After rapid initial adsorption, changes occur which result in the redistribution of dimethylarsinic acid into a less soluble form associated with aluminum in the soil(1). The dimethylarsinic acid is fixed by iron and aluminum in the soil, although not as strongly as inorganic arsenate(1). Arsenic residues in browse and herbaceous vegetation in Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, and western larch forests in which trees were treated with cacodylic acid, sodium salt for thinning were relatively low(1). Large quantities of arsenic did not move from the forest floor into the soil, indicating that arsenic residues were tightly bound in the foliage(1). Only small amounts of arsenic were detected in streams in forests treated with cacodylic acid or its sodium salt(1). A pKa of 1.57(5) indicates that dimethylarsenic acid will ionize in water(SRC); therefore, dimethylarsenic acid is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from moist soil surfaces(SRC). Dimethylarsenic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 4.6X10-3 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(6). Generation of C-14 labeled CO2 from C-14 labeled dimethylarsenic acid in a clay loam soil reached about 13% (over 98 days of incubation) in soil that had been adapted to dimethylarsenic acid, but was less than 2% in unadapted soil(7); the degradation was presumably microbial in nature(7). Incubation of dimethylarsenic acid in two Japanese soils for a period of six weeks resulted in 4-43% degradation(8); 0% degradation occurred in sterile controls(8). In another study in soil, 36% of dimethylarsenic acid was converted to a volatile organoarsenical compound and 47% to carbon dioxide and arsenate within a 24-week period(9).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

After rapid initial adsorption, changes occur which result in the redistribution of dimethylarsinic acid into a less soluble form associated with aluminum in the soil(1). The dimethylarsinic acid are fixed by iron and aluminum in the soil, although not as strongly as inorganic arsenate(1). Leaching tests conducted in specially constructed boxes with clay, silt loam, and sandy soils noted strong adsorption to all soils, although a small degree of leaching did occur(2). The adsorption of dimethylarsenic acid to sediments and soil was found to depend on clay content, iron oxide content, and pH(3,4); adsorption increases with increasing clay and iron oxide content and with higher pH(3,4). Herbicidal applications of dimethylarsenic acid that were applied to forest floors in the northwestern US were found to be tightly bound, and did not leach in soil(5).",

Blood levels of arsenic does not seem to be correlated with worker exposure to dimethylarsenic acid(1).

In forestry workers, the urinary dimethylarsenic acid level during an 11 week observation period ranged from 24-172 ug/24 hr compared to a range of 26-73 ug/24 hr for non-exposed workers(1). Urine samples of humans were found to contain an average of 15 ug/l of dimethylarsenic acid which constituted an average of 66% of the total urinary excretion of arsenic(3).",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Since only extensive application of the most potent corticosteroids may cause systemic effects in the mother, it is unlikely that short-term application of topical corticosteroids would pose a risk to the breastfed infant by passage into breastmilk. However, it would be prudent to use the least potent drug on the smallest area of skin possible. It is particularly important to ensure that the infant's skin does not come into direct contact with the areas of skin that have been treated. Current guidelines allow topical corticosteroids to be applied to the nipples just after nursing for eczema, with the nipples cleaned gently before nursing. Only water-miscible cream or gel products should be applied to the breast because ointments may expose the infant to high levels of mineral paraffins via licking.",

She had 5.7 mg of betamethasone sodium phosphate and acetate mixture injected into her shoulder for bursitis with no effect on lactation. Four weeks later, she continued to have pain in her thoracic cervical regions and was diagnosed with neural sensitization. She had 80 to 120 mg of triamcinolone diacetate injected into her cervical and thoracic spine epidurally and into the facets. Three days later, she noticed a decrease in milk supply and a reduced ejection reflex which continued to worsen over the next 5 days. She began using a breast pump with frequent pumping and domperidone as a galactogogue. Her milk slowly increased over several days and was normal by 21 days after the injection when she stopped domperidone. At that time, her serum prolactin levels were elevated. The decrease in the mother's milk supply was possibly caused by the corticosteroid injections. Medium to large doses of corticosteroids given systemically or injected into joints or the breast have been reported to cause temporary reduction of lactation.",

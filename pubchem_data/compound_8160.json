When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The materials were applied under occlusion for 24 hr at dose levels of 0.2 and 2.0 g/kg (undiluted) and as a 10% aqueous solution (0.2 g/kg diethylene glycol butyl ether). Preliminary washing efficiency studies with soap and water indicated that greater than 89% of each chemical could be removed from rat skin following 5 min exposures. Female rats excreted a larger proportion of the applied dose of diethylene glycol butyl ether than did male rats. Similar results were obtained with the low dose of diethylene glycol butyl ether applied neat or as a 10% aqueous solution, suggesting that the low dose represents a saturating dose. The total recovered (14)C for all studies with (14)C-diethylene glycol butyl ether ranged from 83% to 89%, with (14)C-diethylene glycol butyl acetate derivative, from 80% to 88%. Urinary excretion accounted for the majority of recovered (14)C in all studies. The acid, 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)acetate acid was the major urinary metabolite identified. The glucuronide of diethylene glycol butyl ether was present at levels of from 5.2 to 8.2% of the urinary (14)C. The dermal absorption rates were estimated to be 1.58 (diethylene glycol butyl acetate derivative, male), 1.28 (diethylene glycol butyl acetate derivative, female), 0.73 (diethylene glycol butyl ether, male), and 1.46 (diethyl glycol butyl ether, female), expressed as mg/cu cm/hr.",

Urine, feces, and expired air were collected for up to 72 hours and assayed for (14)C activity. The urine samples were analyzed for diethylene glycol butyl acetate derivative metabolites. The rats were killed 72 hours post dosing to determine the tissue distribution of (14)C activity. In-vitro, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate was rapidly hydrolyzed by rat blood to diethylene glycol monobutyl ether; the biological half-life was less than 3 minutes. Only 3.8% of the diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate was hydrolyzed by saline after 14 minutes. The urine was the major pathway for eliminating diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate derived (14)C activity, 82.3 and 81.3% of the 200 and 2000 mg/kg doses, respectively, being eliminated after 24 hours. Only 2 to 3% of each dose was eliminated in the feces. About 5% of each dose was eliminated in the expired air, mostly as radioactive carbon dioxide. Only about 1.1 and 3.0% of the 200 and 2000 mg/kg doses were found in the tissues and carcass. Most of that radioactivity was found in the carcass. 2-(2-Butoxyethoxy)acetic acid was the major metabolite identified. No unchanged diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate or diethylene glycol monobutyl ether or 2-butoxyacetic acid, a putative hematotoxic diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate metabolite, was found. /Results indicate/ that diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate is rapidly hydrolyzed to diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate by rat blood. This suggests that the biological effects of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate and diethylene glycol monobutyl ether would be indistinguishable. No butoxyacetic acid is produced. The data are consistent with the low subchronic toxicity of diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate.",

The materials were applied under occlusion for 24 hr at dose levels of 0.2 and 2.0 g/kg (undiluted) and as a 10% aqueous solution (0.2 g/kg diethylene glycol butyl ether). Preliminary washing efficiency studies with soap and water indicated that greater than 89% of each chemical could be removed from rat skin following 5 min exposures. Female rats excreted a larger proportion of the applied dose of diethylene glycol butyl ether than did male rats. Similar results were obtained with the low dose of diethylene glycol butyl ether applied neat or as a 10% aqueous solution, suggesting that the low dose represents a saturating dose. The total recovered (14)C for all studies with (14)C-diethylene glycol butyl ether ranged from 83% to 89%, with (14)C-diethylene glycol butyl acetate derivative, from 80% to 88%. Urinary excretion accounted for the majority of recovered (14)C in all studies. The acid, 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)acetate acid was the major urinary metabolite identified. The glucuronide of diethylene glycol butyl ether was present at levels of from 5.2 to 8.2% of the urinary (14)C. The dermal absorption rates were estimated to be 1.58 (diethylene glycol butyl acetate derivative, male), 1.28 (diethylene glycol butyl acetate derivative, female), 0.73 (diethylene glycol butyl ether, male), and 1.46 (diethyl glycol butyl ether, female), expressed as mg/cu cm/hr.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

(2003) have tested the toxicity of EGBEA on Ceriodaphnia dubia according to the draft of the method AFNOR NF T90-376 (equivalent to the OECD guideline No 211). An EC10 of 30.4 mg/L has been determined after seven days. One daphnid was disposed per container, in ten replicates. The parental mortality and the number of offspring per living parent were used as endpoints. Other test conditions are shown here: eight concentrations plus control were tested at a temperature of 23 +/- 1 \u00b0C and pH = 8-9, DO = 8.1-8.3 mg/L and water hardness was 200 +/- 40 mg/L (CaCO3). An analytical monitoring was performed but results were expressed based on nominal concentrations. The 95% confidence interval for the EC10 ranged between 9.89 and 37.73 mg/L.

No effect was detected at any concentration tested. A NOEC of 300 mg/L was determined in test 2. This test was performed according to the norm ISO 8692: \"Water quality -  fresh water and algal growth inhibition test with Scenedesmus subspicatus and Selenestrum capricornutum\". Test conditions were as follow: incubation occurred on a shaking table under constant temperature (approximately 23 \u00b0C) and light. Each test was performed on three replicate batches at each concentration and at each control batch. The cell densities were determined using an electronic particle counter after 24, 48 and 72 hours and the inhibition of growth was estimated as the average growth rate expressed as a percentage of the control growth rate. EC50 was calculated by means of probit analysis and NOEC was determined by using a software (TOXSTAT). It can also be noticed that although the solutions were analysed, toxicity results were based on nominal concentrations.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.375 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hrs. Ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 15. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.46X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Using the Zahn-Wellens screening method, biodegradation of ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate exceeded 90% over 28 days, indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 and 70 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives for ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate are 300 and 30 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate is produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.46X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 and 70 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 4(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

Vapor-phase ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

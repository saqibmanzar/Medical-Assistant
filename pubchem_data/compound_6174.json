PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Ten non-smoking patients with mildly to moderately active left-sided ulcerative colitis unresponsive to first-line therapy were treated in an open protocol with nightly nicotine tartrate liquid enemas at a dose of 3 mg nicotine base for 1 week then 6 mg for 3 weeks. Clinical assessments were determined at baseline and 4 weeks by endoscopy, physician assessment and a patient diary of daily symptoms. Peak and trough serum nicotine and trough plasma cotinine were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography, respectively. After 4 weeks of treatment, 5/7 patients (71%) showed clinical and sigmoidoscopic improvement (per protocol analysis). The other three patients discontinued therapy within 7 days because of inability to retain the liquid enemas. No patients showed histologic improvement. Six of the patients who completed the 4-week study had peak and trough serum nicotine concentration determined, only 1 of 6 patients had a detectable peak nicotine concentration (value 2.3 ng/mL), and all six patients had undetectable trough nicotine concentrations. The mean trough plasma cotinine concentration was 13 +/- 10 ng/mL. Transient and mild adverse events occurred in 4/10 patients (nausea, lightheadedness, tremor, sleep disturbance). Given the low or undetectable serum nicotine concentrations, these adverse events are not likely to be related to the nicotine enemas. Nicotine tartrate liquid enemas administrated at a dose of 3 mg nicotine base/day for 1 week and then 6 mg/day for 3 weeks are safe and appear to result in clinical improvement in some patients with mildly to moderately active, left-sided ulcerative colitis unresponsive to first-line therapy. Placebo-controlled trials are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.",

(3)H-nicotine was more potent when given into the subarachnoid space than by any other route of administration. Further, disposition studies showed that (3)H-nicotine was almost entirely contained in the thoracic and lumbar areas.

Thirty healthy volunteers received 45 ug nicotine base/kg (as nicotine tartrate) in one of five formulations (each n = 6): hydrophilic acidic liquid enema, hydrophilic basic liquid enema, hydrophobic acidic liquid enema, hydrophobic basic liquid enema, and oral solution. All participants also received 15 ug nicotine base/kg (as nicotine tartrate) intravenously during a separate study period. Serum concentrations of nicotine were determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. The mean (+/-SD) bioavailabilities of nicotine after administration in the liquid enema formulations (hydrophilic acidic 17 +/- 18%, hydrophilic basic 16 +/- 16%, hydrophobic acidic 25 +/- 17%, hydrophobic basic 15 +/- 12%) were similar to the bioavailability of nicotine after administration by oral solution (20 +/- 25%). The bioavailabilities of nicotine for all five nonintravenous formulations were significantly less than for intravenous nicotine (100%). Serum concentrations of nicotine did not predict adverse reactions. Nicotine tartrate administered as either a liquid enema or as an oral solution had low bioavailability and was well tolerated. ...",

In some experiments the nicotine receptors were blocked with mecamylamine or hexamethonium, and their effects on nicotine levels were measured. The nicotine-induced tremor was allowed visually, and its effects on the heart rate were measured by ECG. In adult mice the peak levels of brain nicotine occurred at 10 min, whereas in infant mice the brain nicotine levels were still rising at 20 min. In the latter the blood and heart nicotine levels were higher than the respective brain levels, and the nicotine level in the brain stem exceeded the hemisphere level. The results were reversed in adult mice. A remarkable accumulation of nicotine in the infant heart was measured. Pretreatment with mecamylamine lowered brain nicotine levels in adult mice, and in infant mice the nicotine levels in blood and heart were lowered as well. This pretreatment abolished the nicotine tremor and its effects on the heart rate similarly in both age groups. This suggests that the difference in nicotine levels after mecamylamine in infant and adult mice may not depend solely on possible differences in circulatory changes but can represent differences in \"receptor population\" as well. Hexamethonium did not abolish the central depressant effect of nicotine on the heart rate nor did it lower the brain nicotine levels. ...",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

On the fifth day of patch use, subjects received a combined infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine and cotinine, with measurement of disposition kinetics of nicotine and cotinine, and cardiovascular and plasma catecholamine responses to nicotine. Half of the subjects were studied under alkaline urine conditions and the other half under acidic urine conditions. Steady-state plasma mecamylamine concentrations were twice as high (mean, 12.2 versus 6.3 ng/mL), consistent with lower renal clearance (2.1 versus 5.8 mL/min/kg) during alkaline compared with acidic urine conditions. Mecamylamine did not significantly affect the clearances of nicotine or cotinine. Mecamylamine significantly reduced the volume of distribution and inhibited the cardioacceleratory and epinephrine-releasing effects of nicotine. Mecamylamine has little effect on the clearance of nicotine and is not expected to affect steady-state levels during transdermal nicotine dosing. The reduction of the volume of distribution of nicotine by mecamylamine suggests that part of the antagonism of nicotinic central nervous system effects by mecamylamine may be due to a pharmacokinetic interaction-most likely decreased transport of nicotine into the brain or decreased binding to nicotine receptors. Mecamylamine may decrease the potential adverse cardiovascular effects of coadministered nicotine.",

Fourteen rats were infused for 7 days with 9 mg/kg/day nicotine tartrate in saline via an Alzet osmotic minipump. Fourteen rats were sham-operated and remained nicotine-naive. Half of each group received 4.5 mg/kg naloxone SC immediately before a \"blind\" 15-min observation, while the other half received saline alone. ANOVA revealed significant nicotine infusion, naloxone injection and interaction effects. Post-hoc analysis showed that the nicotine-infused rats injected with naloxone had significantly more signs than all other groups (P < 0.01). ...",

The present study consisted of two experiments. Experiment 1 examined the toxicological response of rats to nicotine tartrate (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mg/kg) in combination with either of two H1-histamine receptor antagonists, the ethylene diamine tripelennamine HCl (0.0, 16.0, 32.0, and 64.0 mg/kg) or the aminoethyl ether diphenhydramine HCl (0.0, 32.0, 64.0, and 96.0 mg/kg). Adult female rats received intraperitoneal injections when housed 12 per cage and toxicological response (number dead per group) was assessed 24 hours post-treatment. The results showed that over the dose ranges employed, and when given alone, nicotine was completely non-lethal, tripelennamine was virtually non-lethal and diphenhydramine was toxic only at the highest dose (5 of 12, at 96.0 mg/kg). However, when nicotine and the antihistamines were delivered in combinations, the toxicological response was markedly altered. Tripelennamine in combination with nicotine yielded supra-additive interaction, with the degree of potentiation being a simple linear function of nicotine within each dose of tripelennamine. The interaction between nicotine and diphenhydramine was more complicated, with certain dose combinations yielding supra-additivity, yet with others yielding antagonism. It was suggested that seizure-precipitated cardiopulmonary collapse was the immediate cause of death, plausibly mediated by central mechanisms. As such, Experiment 2 examined the influence of adding the proconvulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (0.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg) to nicotine (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 mg/kg)-tripelennamine (0.0 and 32.0 mg/kg) combination treatments. Effects were assessed both at 1.0 and 24.0 hours post-injection.",

Under these conditions lipoprotein lipase activity was present in human adipose tissue fragments which converted [14C]glucose to 14CO2 and [14C]triglyceride. Both metabolic parameters studied were affected by human tumor necrosis factor and brefeldin A. When fragments of human adipose tissue after 1 week in culture were incubated with nicotine tartrate for 20 hr, a slight but significant increase in lipoprotein lipase activity was observed, and an increased conversion of [14C]glucose to 14CO2 and [14C]triglyceride occurred. Nicotine was taken up by human adipose tissue, but no conversion to cotinine was observed. Our data demonstrate a direct effect of nicotine on human adipose tissue metabolism. Furthermore, it is suggested that weight loss in smokers is a multifactorial phenomenon, and one of the important factors to be considered is the direct effect of nicotine within the tissue.",

An animal model was used, which permitted administration of drugs directly into the artery feeding the sinus and simultaneous recording of changes in the mucociliary activity. When nicotine bitartrate was given intraarterially (0.5-10.0 ug/kg), it resulted in a brief (1 min at most) acceleration of the mucociliary frequency. The response was dose-dependent and a max increase of 34.9% was recorded at 10.0 ug/kg. The response was inhibited by a preceding injection of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium (0.2 mg/kg).",

To evaluate the role of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis in this effect of nicotine, male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically treated (3 times daily, ip) over a 14 day period with either saline, 0.8 mg/kg nicotine, 10 mg/kg caffeine and were pretreated (once daily) with either saline or 20 mg/kg nadolol, a long-acting beta-adrenergic receptor blocker. Nicotine significantly reduced body weight gain but not food intake and nadolol did not reverse the effect of nicotine on body weight gain. To evaluate whether nicotine induces brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, rats were injected ip with either saline or 0.8, 1.2 or 1.6 mg/kg nicotine hydrogen tartrate, with 5 mg/kg dl-phenylpropanolamine or with a combination of 0.8 mg/kg nicotine and 10 mg/kg caffeine with interscapular brown adipose tissue temperatures recorded for 30 minutes after injection. A combination of caffeine and nicotine produced a temperature increase in interscapular brown adipose tissue (0.95 degree C) 63% of that induced by 5 mg/kg dl-phenylpropanolamine. /Nicotine hydrogen tartrate/",

Adult New Zealand rabbits (n=22) weighting 3,000-3,500 g were used in this experimental study. Rabbits were randomly divided into two groups. Achilles tendon was transversely incised and repaired in all animals. In the experiment group subcutaneous injection of Nicotine tartrate 3 mg/kg/day was done. In the control group Serum physiologic injection was done at the same dosage. The injections were made three times a day in equal dosages. Nicotine and SF injections were made until the end of the 8-week, and then all animals were euthanized. Both light microscopic and electron microscopic evaluations were made on 14 animals. In N group light microscopic evaluation showed a visible gap in repair site. The total tendon score represented in N group was less than in SF group. The statistical analysis of the groups was significantly different for total tendon scores (P=0.002). Beside this electron microscopic examination showed inactive and degenerated fibroblasts and irregular collagen fibrils around them as well as collagen synthesis interruption in N group. Biomechanical evaluation was made on eight animals. The average tensile strength values in Group N (139.47+/-44.55 N) were significantly lower than those in Group SF (265.9+/-39.01 N) (z=2.309, P=0.029). Nicotine is the major chemical component common to all cigarettes and previously has been shown to affect wound and fracture healing adversely. The results of this study show that nicotine impairs achilles tendon healing after a surgical repair.",

Eight-week-old male Zucker fatty rats (ZFRs) were administered nicotine tartrate dihydrate (4.6 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water. The control group was pair-fed. The body weights and food intake over 8 weeks were similar in both groups. Plasma glucose levels at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 min after insulin administration (0.5 U/kg) in the nicotine group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The calculated K(ITT) value for the nicotine group was significantly higher than that for the control group. Wet weight of the liver in the nicotine group was significantly lower than that in the control group. Transaminases and histological examination of the liver revealed no alteration by nicotine administration. Glycogen, glycogen synthetase activity and gluconeogenesis in the liver in the nicotine group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Phosphorylase-a activity of the liver in the nicotine group was significantly higher than that in the control group. Glycogen, glycogen synthetase, and phosphorylase-a activity of skeletal muscle were similar in both groups. ...",

If released to the atmosphere, toluene-3,5-diamine is expected to degrade relatively rapidly (estimated half-life of 1.6 hr) by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. If released to soil, toluene-3,5-diamine may undergo a covalent chemical bonding with humic materials which can result in its chemical alteration to a latent form and prevent leaching. In the absence of covalent bonding, leaching may be possible. If released to water, covalent bounding with humic materials in the water column and sediments may result in partitioning from the water column to sediments. By analogy to the aromatic amine chemical class, toluene-3,5-diamine in the water column may be susceptible to photooxidation via hydroxyl and peroxy radicals. A single biological screening study has indicated that toluene-3,5-diamine is resistant to biodegradation; however, insufficient data are available to assess the relative importance of biodegradation in soil or water. Occupational exposure to toluene-3,5-diamine may occur through dermal contact and inhalation, with skin contact being the most likely route of exposure. (SRC)",

This covalent bonding proceeds in two steps(1); a rapid and reversible bonding followed by a slower and much less reversible reaction(1). Leaching in soil may be possible prior to the occurrence of the slower bonding reaction. In the absence of covalent bonding, leaching may be possible based upon an estimated Koc of 1.34(2,SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

When administered to rodents, haloacetates have been shown to increase formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels in the liver. These responses appear to be modified by prior treatment. To examine potential mechanisms that account for these modifications in oxidative stress, the ability of trichloroacetate (TCA) or dichloroacetate (DCA) pretreatment to alter the metabolism of bromodichloroacetate (BDCA) and the disposition of its metabolites was examined in male B6C3F1 mice. Two-week pretreatment with 1 g/L DCA and TCA in the drinking water of mice alters the initial hepatic metabolism of BDCA and the further metabolism of its metabolite DCA. DCA pretreatment inhibits cytosolic metabolism of both 1 mM DCA or BDCA up to 70%. In contrast, DCA pretreatment stimulates hepatic microsomal BDCA metabolism 1.3-fold but has little effect on microsomal metabolism of DCA. Increased microsomal metabolism of BDCA appears to be attributable to the induction of a metabolic pathway that produces CO2 and bromodichloromethane (BDCM) as metabolites. TCA pretreatment inhibits BDCA metabolism up to 70% in the cytosol and 30% in microsomes but has little effect on DCA metabolism. These results indicate that the hepatic metabolism of the haloacetate becomes quite complex at the high doses that have been employed in cancer bioassays. BDCA serves as a good example, because it is metabolized to at least two carcinogenic metabolites that have different modes of action, BDCM and DCA. As doses approach those that induce cancer in mice, the proportion of and amounts of these metabolites as a fraction of the dose administered will change substantially. This article demonstrates that those interactions will occur from mixed treatment with haloacetates as well.",

Several experimental approaches were undertaken in this study to investigate the DNA covalent binding potential of reactive intermediates generated by GSTT1-1-mediated metabolism of CHBrCl(2). First, rodent hepatic cytosol incubations containing (14)CHBrCl(2), supplemented glutathione (GSH), and calf thymus DNA resulted in approximately 3-fold (rat liver cytosol) and 7-fold (mouse liver cytosol) greater amounts of total radioactivity (RAD) associated with the purified DNA as compared to a control (absence of rodent cytosol) following liquid scintillation counting (LSC) of isolated DNA. The relative increase in DNA labeling is consistent with the conjugation activity of these rodent cytosols toward CHBrCl(2). Second, exposure of GSTT1-1-expressing S. typhimurium to (14)CHBrCl(2) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase of bacterial DNA-associated total radioactivity. Characterization of DNA-associated radioactivity could not be assigned to a specific deoxynucleoside adduct(s) following enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA and subsequent HPLC analysis. A possible explanation for this observation was formation of a transient adduct that was unstable in the DNA isolation and hydrolysis procedures employed. To circumvent problems of adduct instability, reactions of (14)CHBrCl(2) with GSH catalyzed by recombinant rat GSTT1-1 were performed in the presence of calf thymus DNA or, alternatively, the model nucleophile deoxyguanosine. Hydroxyapatite chromatography of (14)C-labeled DNA or HPLC chromatography of (14)C-labeled deoxyguanosine derivatives demonstrated the covalent binding of (14)CHBrCl(2)-derived metabolites to DNA and deoxyguanosine in low yield (approximately 0.02% of (14)CHBrCl(2) biotransformed by GSTT1-1 resulted in DNA adducts). Cytochrome P450 (CYP)- and GST-catalyzed biotransformation of CHBrCl(2) in rat tissues (kidney and large intestine) that develop tumors following chronic CHBrCl(2) exposure were compared with rat liver (a nontarget tissue). Rat liver had a significant capacity to detoxify CHBrCl(2) (to carbon dioxide) compared with kidney and large intestine as a result of CYP-catalyzed oxidation, liver was approximately 16-fold more efficient than kidney and large intestine when intrinsic clearance values (V(max)/K(m)) were compared. In contrast, the efficiency of GST-mediated GSH conjugation of CHBrCl(2) in kidney and large intestine was only slightly lower than liver (approximately 2- to 4-fold lower), thus, the relative amounts of reactive intermediates that are produced with the capacity to covalently modify DNA may be enhanced in these extrahepatic tissues. The significance of these findings is that conjugation of CHBrCl(2) with GSH can result in the covalent modification of DNA and that cancer target tissues in rats have a much reduced detoxification capacity, but only a modest decrease in bioactivation capacity, as compared to the liver (a nontarget tissue in rats).",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The effects of glutathione (GSH) on in vivo bromodichloromethane (BDCM)toxicity and in vitro BDCM macromolecular binding were evaluated. The in vivo toxicity of BDCM in animals pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, a glutathione synthesis inhibitor) and in untreated male Fischer 344 rats was investigated. In another experiment, covalent binding to protein and lipid was quantified after (14C)BDCM was incubated with hepatic microsomal and S9 fractions and renal microsomes from F344 rats, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, with and without added GSH. After oral dosing with BDCM, the BSO-pretreated animals had greatly increased levels of serum indicators of hepatotoxicity and serum and urinary indicators of nephrotoxicity compared to those in animals dosed solely with BDCM. Histopathological examination revealed that hepatic necrosis was more severe than renal necrosis in the BSO-treated rats. When GSH was added to an aerobic incubation, protein binding was decreased in hepatic microsomal and S9 fractions by 92 and 83%, respectively. GSH also decreased lipid binding by 55% in hepatic microsomal incubations carried out under anaerobic conditions. Addition of GSH decreased renal microsomal protein (aerobic) and lipid binding (anaerobic) by 20 and 43%, respectively. These data indicate that GSH is an important protective factor in the toxicity associated with BDCM.",

Br2CHCl possessed a greater hepatotoxic and lethal potential than BrCHCl2. However, both Br2CHCl and BrCHCl2 were weak hepatotoxicants as compared to a related trihalomethane, CHCl3. Br2CHCl and BrCHCl2 did not produce liver injury until near-lethal dosages were administered. Neither trihalomethane appeared to produce appreciable kidney injury during the 24-hr challenge period. Pretreatment of rats with acetone (15 mmol/kg, po) markedly potentiated the hepatotoxic response to BrCHCl2 and Br2CHCl. The potentiated response observed with acetone plus BrCHCl2 or Br2CHCl was equal to or greater than that observed with acetone plus an approximately equimolar dosage of CHCl3. That is, acetone appeared to convert these weak hepatotoxicants into strong hepatotoxicants.",

A rodent model of hereditary renal cancer was used to investigate the carcinogenic response to a mixture of drinking water disinfection by-products (DBPs). Rats carrying a mutation in the Tsc2 tumor suppressor gene (Eker rats) readily develop renal preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions, and are highly susceptible to the effects of renal carcinogens. Male and female Eker rats were exposed via drinking water to individual or a mixture of DBPs for 4 or 10 months. Potassium bromate, 3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (MX), chloroform, and bromodichloromethane were administered at low concentrations of 0.02, 0.005, 0.4 and 0.07 g/L, respectively, and high concentrations of 0.4, 0.07, 1.8 and 0.7 g/L, respectively. Low and high dose mixture solutions were comprised of all four chemicals at either low concentrations or high concentrations, respectively, Following necropsy, each kidney was examined microscopically for preneoplastic lesions (atypical tubules and hyperplasias) and tumors. While some of the mixture responses observed in male rats did fall within the range expected for an additive response, especially at the high dose, predominantly antagonistic effects on renal lesions were observed in response to the low dose mixture in male rats and the high dose mixture in female rats. These data suggest that current default risk assessments assuming additivity may overstate the cancer risk associated with exposure to mixtures of DBPs at low concentrations..",

Results from a population-based case-control study of 486 incident cases of pancreatic cancer and 3,596 age- and sex-matched controls /are reported/.

Logistic regression analysis found no evidence of increased pancreatic cancer risk at higher CDBP concentrations (all odds ratios < 1.3). Null findings were also obtained assuming a latency period for pancreatic cancer induction of 3, 8, or 13 years. /Chlorination disinfection by-products/",

Three hours after administration of bromodichloromethane, the modulation of phospholipid metabolism and the accumulation of triacylglycerol were noted in the microsomal membranes. A marked decrease in the synthetic rate of phosphatidylcholine was accompanied by a fall in the microsomal activity of phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. A decrease in glycerophosphate acyltransferase activity and an enhancement in phosphatidic phosphatase activity seemed to offset each other, and no significant change was noted in the synthetic rate of microsomal triacylglycerol.",

This study design was selected to identify the physiologic process (development; female reproduction; male reproduction; various somatic organs/processes) that is the most sensitive to bromodichloromethane exposure. The dose range-finding study was conducted at concns of 0, 100, 500, 1,000, & 1,500 ppm of bromodichloromethane in the drinking water for 2 wks. Based on decreases in water consumption, concns of 0, 100, 700, & 1,300 ppm (Groups 1, 2, 3, & 4, respectively) were selected for the main study. The main study utilized 2 groups of male rats designated as Group A (non-BrdU treated animals, 10/group in Groups 1-4) & Group B (BrdU treated, 5 animals in Groups 1, 2, & 3, & 8 animals in Group 4), & three groups of female rats designated as Group A (peri-conception exposure, 10/group in Groups 1-4), Group B (gestational exposure, 13/group in Groups 1-4), & Group C (peri-conception exposure, BrdU-treated, 5 animals in Groups 1, 2, & 3, & 8 animals in Group 4). Control animals received deionized water, the vehicle. During the treatment period, all animals except one survived to the scheduled necropsy. Body weights & feed & water consumption were decreased at many of the intervals for the 700 & 1,300 ppm dose groups. Body weights were decreased by 5-13% compared to the controls at many of the intervals while feed consumption was decreased 14-47%, & water consumption was decreased by 17-86% at many of the intervals. The overall calculated mean consumption of BDCM for Groups 2-4 was 11, 53, & 88 mg/kg/day, respectively. At necropsy, clinical chemistry & hematology endpoints were unaffected by BDCM treatment except for a 43% incr in the 5'-Nucleotidase in the 1,300 ppm A males, which most likely represents interference with the secretion of bile, & a 14% decr in creatinine in the 100 ppm A males. Necropsy organ weights & organ-to-body weight ratios were comparable to the controls. Gross findings were comparable across all groups. Microscopically, cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes & individual hepatocyte necrosis were observed in tissues from the 700 & 1,300 ppm A males & the 1,300 ppm B males, indicative of mild liver damage. Hematopoietic cell proliferation in the spleen was observed in tissues from all dosed A males, but this is most likely an indirect change in response to stress... . The Labeling Index (LI) for the liver & kidney from the B males were relatively comparable between treated & control groups, but the LI for the liver & kidneys from the 1300 ppm C females were significantly increased, indicating possible early stimulation of cellular proliferation. There were no treatment-related findings noted in any male & female reproductive parameters. Results of this study indicate that BDCM at doses at & above 700 ppm produced consistent decreases in body weight & food & water consumption in both sexes, but did not result in any male or female reproductive toxicity. From these data, BDCM is taste-aversive & a general toxicant in both sexes at doses at & above 700 ppm.",

All rats survived to the end of the study. The mean body weight gains of 350 and 700 mg/L rats were significantly less than that of the controls. Concentration-related decreases in water consumption were evident during the first week on study. Relative kidney weights of rats in the 175, 350, and 700 mg/L groups were significantly greater than that of the controls. There were no significant chemical-related histopathological changes. 3-Week study in mice: Groups of 10 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to target concentrations of 0, 43.7, 87.5, 175, 350, or 700 mg/L bromodichloromethane (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 0, 6, 10, 16, 29 or 51 mg/kg) in drinking water for 3 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Final mean body weights of the 175, 350, and 700 mg/L mice and mean body weight gains of 350 and 700 mg/L mice were significantly less than those of the controls. These decreases were attributed to decreased water consumption. There were significant concentration-related decreases in water consumption by groups exposed to 87.5 mg/L or greater throughout the study; these decreases were attributed to poor palatability of the dosed water. Relative liver, kidney, and thymus weights of mice in the 350 and 700 mg/L groups were significantly greater than those of the controls. Absolute lung weights of mice in the 350 and 750 mg/L groups were significantly less than that of the controls. There were no significant chemical-related histopathological changes.",

Survival of exposed groups was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of all exposed groups were generally similar to those of the controls throughout the study. Water consumption by exposed rats was less than that by the controls throughout the study; the decreases were attributed to poor palatability of the dosed water. There were no increased incidences of neoplasms that were attributed to bromodichloromethane. The incidences of chronic inflammation in the liver of the 350 and 700 mg/L groups were significantly greater than that in the controls; however, the biological significance of these increases is uncertain. 2-Year study in mice: Groups of 50 female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to target concentrations of 0, 175, 350, 700 mg/L bromodichloromethane (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 9, 18, or 36 mg/kg) in drinking water for 2 years. Survival of exposed groups was similar to that of the controls. Mean body weights of all exposed groups were generally less than those of the controls from week 4 through the end of the study. Water consumption by exposed mice was less than that by the controls throughout the study; the decreases were attributed to poor palatability of the dosed water. The incidences of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) occurred with a negative trend, and the incidence in the 700 mg/L group was significantly decreased relative to the control group. The incidence of hemangiosarcoma in all organs was significantly decreased in the 350 mg/L group. Under the conditions of this 2-year drinking water study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of bromodichloromethane in male F344/N rats exposed to target concentrations of 175, 350, or 700 mg/L. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of bromodichloromethane in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to target concentrations of 175, 350, or 700 mg/L.",

The predominant anthropogenic source of bromodichloromethane release to the environment is its inadvertent formation during chlorination treatment processes of water. Bromodichloromethane occurs naturally in ice macro algae from McMurdo Sound, Antarctic and is subsequently released to sea water. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 50 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates bromodichloromethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bromodichloromethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 205 days. Bromodichloromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bromodichloromethane is expected to have high to moderate mobility based upon estimated Koc values of 53-251. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.12X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Bromodichloromethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. No degradation occurred in 6 weeks using mixed methanogenic bacterial cultures from sewage effluents in either sterile or seeded conditions, suggesting that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, bromodichloromethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 186 and 18.6 years at pHs 7 and 8, respectively, suggest hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. Occupational exposure to bromodichloromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bromodichloromethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bromodichloromethane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound in treated water.

Bromodichloromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).

Rapid degradation was observed in a continuous-flow methanogenic fixed-film laboratory-scale column using seeded cultures, but only slow degradation was noted in sterile controls(3). In a groundwater recharge field experiment, bromodichloromethane passed through the biologically active zone (approximate time 0.75 days) with no appreciable degradation(4). Using a continuous-flow biofilm column reactor using primary settled sewage as seed, 50 ug/L bromodichloromethane was degraded to at or below the detection limit of 0.1 ug/L in 120 days(5). Based on a review of literature, bromodichloromethane biodegrades fast in anaerobic aquatic environments(6). Bromodichloromethane is reported to exhibit low and high anaerobic degradation rates of 0.025 and 0.099/day, respectively(7), corresponding to half-lives 28 and 7 days, respectively(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 205 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 1.2X10-3 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 186 and 18.6 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2). Bromodichloromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that bromodichloromethane is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). Based on experimentally determined gas transfer rates, the volatilization half-life of bromodichloromethane from rivers and streams has been estimated to range from 33 min to 12 days with a typical half-life of about 35 hours(3). Bromodichloromethane volatilization constants were estimated in chilled (4 \u00b0C) and boiled (100 \u00b0C) water to be 0.076/hour and 1.52/hour, respectively(4). Estimated volatilization constants in room-temperature experiments at 25 and 30 \u00b0C ranged from 0.046/hour to 0.427/hour depending on the width and liquid level in the glass(4). Bromodichloromethane's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of bromodichloromethane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 50 mm Hg(5). Significant volatilization (half-life of about one hour) was observed from laboratory tanks(6). Approximately 50% of applied bromodichloromethane volatilized from soil columns during laboratory studies which monitored transport and fate mechanisms(7).",

Drinking water from Cairo, Egypt sampled during February, March, August, and September 1989 contained bromodichloromethane at avg concns of 45.93, 51.12, 9.98, and 11.22 ug/L, respectively(2).Reservoir water concns of bromodichloromethane from two water systems in Sardinia, Italy ranged from 0.2 to 30.5 ug/L and from three well systems, 0.1 to 10.3 ug/L(3). Drinking water from 8 cities in Saudi Arabia collected during the summer months of July to October 1989 contained bromodichloromethane at median concns ranging from 0.0 ppb (Buraidah) to 2.75 ppb (Makkah)(4). Concns from various cities in several countries ranged from 0 ppb (Taiwan) to 14 ppb (Osaka Japan)(4). In a survey of drinking waters from 12 areas of the world (China, Taiwan, north and south Philippines, Egypt, Indonesia, Australia, England, Brazil, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Peru), bromodichloromethane was found in 9 of the 12 waters at levels ranging from 1.7-10 ppb(5). Bromodichloromethane was found to be 5.8-40.6% of the total trihalomethane concentrations in the drinking water network for Athens, Mytilene and Chalkida, Greece(6). Bromodichloromethane was detected in the Dnieper River basin, Ukraine at 1-20 ug/L(7). Tap water samples from Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung metropolitan areas of Taiwan contained 23.15, 9.55 and 30.27 ug/L of bromodichloromethane, respectively and drinking water concentrations of 2.13 ug/L, not detected and 6.51 ug/L in the same areas(8). Bromodichloromethane, studied in 5 locations in each of 3 treatment plants for a one year period from Jan to Dec 1994, contained concns of 1.1-3.9 ug/L in a plant with source water from the Ottawa River using chlorine/chloramine treatment, 2.3-6.7 ug/L in another plant with source water from the Ottawa River but using chlorine/chlorine treatment and 0.4-3.2 ug/L in a plant with source water from LaLievre River using ozone/chlorine treatment(9). Bromodichloromethane was detected in 35 Finnish water works at concns of <0.05-24 ug/L in a study done from Jan to Oct 1994(10). Bromodichloromethane, at concns of not detected to 98.4 ug/L, was found in 12 drinking water samples from Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands from 1980 to 2000(11). Bromodichloromethane was detected in drinking water samples from the Sea of Galilee, Israel water treatment plants in May of 1999, September of 1999 and July of 2000(12). Bromodichloromethane was detected in drinking water from Beijing, China at concns of 0.185-4.63 ug/L(13). In 21 public fountains in Torino, Italy, bromodichloromethane concns were detected at 0.07-0.52 ug/L and 0.13-0.73 ug/L in Dec 1994 and May 1995, respectively(14).",

Levels of 0.3 ppb have been detected in groundwater from the Netherlands(2). Bromodichloromethane was detected at a concn ranging from 9.2 to 16.7 ug/L in finished drinking water obtained from groundwater for the capital area of the Sultanante of Oman, Egypt(3). An unchlorinated sample contained <0.05 ug/L bromodichloromethane(3). The compound was not detected in the entire Biscayne Bay aquifer study area (Superfund site) nor well fields, but was detected at 6.1 ug/L in finished water from treatment plants(4). 4 of 1891 groundwater samples from Wisconsin were found to contain bromodichloromethane although the contamination was felt to be due to air contact in a chlorine-containing pumphouse(5). 0.3% Of ground water used for preparation of drinking water in the Netherlands contained bromodichloromethane at concns exceeding 0.5 ug/mL(6). Bromodichloromethane was found at 0.22 and 9.04 ug/L in 2 of 9 sites tested 1990-1992 in Laquna Asososca area, Managua, Nicaragua(7). Bromodichloromethane was detected in <5% of 208 wells tested in 9 urban land use studies(8). Bromodichloromethane was detected in <5% of 214 ground water samples from 30 industrial areas in Tiawan(9). Bromodichloromethane, at concns of 1.87 to 11.0 ug/L, was found in 3 ground water samples from Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands from 1980 to 2000(10). Bromodichloromethane was not detected in ground water from the Salt River alluvium in Phoenix, AZ(11). In a US survey run from 1985 to 1995 bromodichloromethane was detected in 3% of 406 urban and 0.8% of rural groundwater samples(12). Bromodichloromethane was detected in ground water storage aquifers at 14, 24, and 21 ug/L in 1991-1992, 1993-1994, and 1995-1996 seasons, respectively, in Las Vegas Nevada(13).",

An analysis of various soft drinks found cola beverages to ave 0.9-5.9 ppb bromodichloromethane while clear soft drinks had levels of 0.1-0.2 ppb; municipal water supplies from which the soft drinks were manufactured were found to contain up to 20 ppb trihalomethanes(2). Bromodichloromethane was found in the following foods: flavored sparkling water, 12 ng/g; fruit drink, 5 ng/g; carbonated soft drinks, 1-12 ng/g(3). The compound was not detected (detection limit= 12 ppb) in butter purchased from retail outlets located near dry-cleaning establishments(4). Bromodichloromethane was found in grapefruit juice (0.20 ug/kg); reconstituted lemon juice (1.05 ug/kg); reconstituted lime juice (1.00 ug/kg); reconstituted orange juice (0.20-1.27 ug/kg); and in orange drink (0.80 ug/kg)(5). The following foods were also found to contain bromodichloromethane: whey and longhorn cheese process water (2.2 ng/g); gingerale soda (2.3 ng/g); sparkling soda (1.2 ng/g); cola soda (1.2 ng/g); ricotta and mozzarella cheese process waters (3.0-8.3 ng/g); process water for lemon-lime soda, lemon soda, and cola soda - trace; process water for vanilla, chocolate, and butter-pecan ice creams (8.3-14.1 ng/g); vanilla ice cream (2.3 ng/g); chocolate ice cream (0.6 ng/g); and butter pecan ice cream (1.1 ng/g)(6). Bromodichloromethane was detected at <0.1-5.2 ppm in bean-curd and water in packaging(7). Summer and winter food intake for 30 Japanese housewives contained concns of bromodichloromethane of not detected to 1.7 ng/g and not detected to 0.8 ng/g in Nagoya, and winter food intake for 30 housewives from Yokohama contained bromodichloromethane from not detected to 1.2 ng/g(8).",

The compound was monitored for but not detected in the workplace air at a bleaching plant of a softwood and hardwood kraft pulp mill in Finland which was found to be slightly genotoxic(2). The general population is exposed to bromodichloromethane through consumption of contaminated drinking water, beverages, and food products. The contamination is a result of inadvertent formation during chlorination treatment of the drinking water and subsequent use of chlorinated tap water to produce food products. Exposure can also occur through inhalation of background levels in ambient air and through dermal exposure in chlorinated swimming pool water(SRC).",

Bromodichloromethane was not detected in any sample from the USEPA National Human Adipose Tissue Survey for fiscal year 1982(2,5). Bromodichloromethane was detected in 14% of the 1072 blood samples (detection limit 0.009 ppb) from a nonoccupationally exposed US population from a survey run from 1988 to 1994(3). Alveolar breath samples of competitive swimmers during a typical 2-hr training period in an indoor facility contained an average of 2.68 ug/cu m bromodichloromethane(4). The estimated blood/breath coefficient was estimated at 0.01 and 0.12 ug/L for the male and female subjects, respectively (detection limit = 0.39 ug/cu m)(4). Alveolar air samples taken in swimmers in Modena, Italy found bromodichloromethane in 30 of 32 at a mean concn of 1.8 ug/cu m(5). Bromodichloromethane was identified in one of eight samples of mother's milk collected from nursing mother's in New Jersey hospitals(6). Bromodichloromethane was found in alveolar air of swimmers at rates of 2.7 ug/cm before swimming to 6.5 ug/cm after swimming. Uptake rates were calculated in the range of 3 ug/hour before swimming and 26 ug/hour after swimming based on research of five swimmers(7). Bromodichloromethane was found in the blood of bath attendants at <0.6 ug/L and in swimmers at <1.8 ug/L(8). Bromodichloromethane was found in blood of women in Cobb County, Georgia at levels of 0.002-0.017 ug/L before showering and 0.017-0.093 ug/L after showering(9). Bromodichloromethane was also found in blood of women from Corpus Christi, Texas at before shower levels of 0.002-0.035 ug/L and after shower levels from 0.009-0.083 ug/L(9).",

Under these conditions, the peptide bonds are broken but the DNP-amino acid bonds remain intact.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The studies presented here indicate that this down regulation by anti-Id is a C independent active process involving a subset of Ia+ T cells in the immune lymph node cell population. Depleting immune LN cells of Ia+ T cells renders them insensitive to inhibition by anti-Id alone, although the same population is inhibited by treatment anti-Id plus C. This c(M population is rendered sensitive to inhibition by anti-Id alone by adding untreated DNFB sensitized LN cells but not by adding normal LN cells. Further studies showed that suppression by anti-Id activated Ia+ T cells occurs locally at the skin test site and is antigen nonspecific. These data indicate the natural regulation of CS to DNFB by autoanti-Id antibodies involves a negative feedback regulatory loop.",

In this work, we investigated by flow cytometry the effect of the contact sensitizers 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB), 1,4-phenylenediamine (PPD) and nickel sulfate (NiSO(4)), on the surface expression of the chemokine receptors CCR6 and CXCR4 in DC. As an experimental model of a DC we used a fetal skin-derived dendritic cell line (FSDC), which has morphological, phenotypical and functional characteristics of skin DC. Our results show that all the skin sensitizers studied decreased the membrane expression of the chemokine receptors CCR6 and CXCR4. In contrast, 2,4-dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB), the inactive analogue of DNFB without contact sensitizing properties, was without effect on the surface expression of these receptors. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which induces the maturation of DC, also reduced surface CCR6 and CXCR4 expression.",

Analysis of draining auricular lymph node tissue sampled at 48 h following exposure to the potent contact allergen 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) provided examples of up- and down-regulated genes, including onzin and guanylate binding protein 2, and glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule 1 (GlyCAM-1), respectively. Allergen-induced changes in these three genes were confirmed in dose-response and kinetic analyses using Northern blotting and/or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction techniques. The results confirmed that these genes are robust and relatively sensitive markers of early changes provoked in the lymph node by contact allergen. Upon further investigation, it was found that altered expression of the adhesion molecule GlyCAM-1 was not restricted to treatment with DNFB. Topical sensitization of mice to a chemically unrelated contact allergen, oxazolone, was also associated with a decrease in the expression of mRNA for GlyCAM-1. Supplementary experiments revealed that changes in expression of this gene are independent of the stimulation by chemical allergens of proliferative responses by draining lymph node cells. Taken together these data indicate that the expression of GlyCAM-1 is down-regulated rapidly following epicutaneous treatment of mice with chemical allergens, but that this reduction is associated primarily with changes in lymph node cell number, or some other aspect of lymph node activation, rather than proliferation.",

In addition, we demonstrate that DNFB strongly induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Our RT-PCR analysis and reporter gene assays reveal that the DNFB-induced intracellular ROS production is necessary for MIP-2 gene expression by DNFB. We observed that the vitamin C and chemical oxidant scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine have an inhibitory effect on the generation of ROS, the activation of MAP kinase pathways, and the MIP-2 gene expression in DNFB-treated RAW 264.7 cells.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.4X10-3 mm Hg at deg 25 C indicates 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 420 days. 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene absorbs light greater than 290 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlight. If released to soil, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 575. Nitrobenzenes adsorb strongly to clay surfaces and the mobility of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to be low in soils rich in clay content. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.8X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. The half-life of 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in a dry silt loam soil was greater than 50 days, suggesting biodegradation occurs slowly in the soil and water. If released into water, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The metabolic fate and disposition of MDEA was assessed following infusion of 50 or 500 mg/kg of radiolabeled MDEA into the jugular veins of Fischer-344-rats or following application of 500 mg/kg to the shaved skin. MDEA was rapidly metabolized following iv administration with only 9% and 44% of the total radioactivity remaining in the plasma as unchanged MDEA 1 hour after dosing with 50 and 500 mg/kg, respectively. The pharmacokinetics at the higher dose appeared to be nonlinear. Plasma radioactivity increased slowly following cutaneous exposure and continued to be available after the chemical was washed off of the skin. Up to 50% of the applied dose was absorbed after 72 hours of skin contact. Up to 24% and 36% of the respective iv and cutaneously administered doses remained in the carcass 72 hours after dosing. The liver and the kidneys contained the highest levels of radioactivity. The principal route of elimination after both methods of exposure was urinary; the elimination half life following cutaneous dosing was more than 30 hours. The major urinary component 72 hours after iv dosing with 500 mg/kg was the parent compound, whereas following cutaneous dosing and iv dosing with 50 mg/kg, the major urinary component was metabolites. The authors conclude that MDEA is easily absorbed from the skin, and that metabolic processes play an important role in the elimination of this compound.",

Amines may be incompatible with isocyanates, halogenated organics, peroxides, phenols (acidic), epoxides, anhydrides, and acid halides. Flammable gaseous hydrogen is generated by amines in combination with strong reducing agents, such as hydrides. This compound may react with oxidizing materials. (NTP, 1992)",

MDEA is used as an intermediate, in absorption of acidic gases, as a catalyst for polyurethane foams, and pH control agent. HUMAN STUDIES: There are no data available. ANIMAL STUDIES: MDEA was irritating to the guinea pig skin, and showed potential to induce allergic contact dermatitis. MDEA caused slight eye irritation. In rats, recurrent skin application of MDEA produced a dose-related irritant effect, but there was no evidence for systemic cumulative or specific target organ or tissue toxicity. Rat dams showed dose-dependent skin irritation following repeated cutaneous application of MDEA during pregnancy. In addition, maternal toxicity was also present as anemia in dams receiving 1000 mg/kg/day. Despite maternal toxicity, there was no evidence of developmental effects. MDEA was not genotoxic when tested in the Salmonella/microsome reverse gene mutation test, the CHO/HGPRT forward gene mutation test, a sister chromatid exchange test in cultured CHO cells, and an in vivo peripheral blood micronucleus test in mice.",

Materials studied were N-methylethanolamine (MEA), N,N,-dimethylethanolamine (DMEA), N,N,-dimethylisopropanolamine (DMIPA), N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and tertbutyldiethanolamine (BDEA). All these alkylalkanolamines were of comparable acute peroral toxicity in the rat (LD50 range 1.48-2.83 mL/kg). By 24 hr occluded epicutaneous contact in the rabbit, MEA, DMEA and DMIPA were of moderate acute percutaneous toxicity (LD50 range 1.13-2.0 mL/kg), MDEA was of slight acute percutaneous toxicity (LD50 male 9.85 mL/kg, female 10.90 mL/kg), and BDEA of intermediate toxicity (LD50 6.4 mL/kg). Due to differences in vapor pressure the acute vapor exposure toxicity of the alkylalkanolamines to rats varied; MEA, MDEA and BDEA were of a low order of acute toxicity, and DMIPA was moderately toxic with an LT50 of 3.2 hr for a saturated vapor atmosphere exposure. A 4 hr-LC50 (rat combined sex) of 1461 ppm was determined for DMEA. All alkylalkanolamines studied, except MDEA, were moderately to markedly irritating and caused variable degrees of skin corrosivity; MDEA caused only transient minor skin irritation. In accord with the skin irritancy results, the eye irritancy from 0.005 mL MEA, DMEA, DMIPA and BDEA was severe, and that from MDEA was slight. Exposure to these compounds has implications for occupational health procedures.",

Two short-term repeated studies (9 days, 6 hr/day) and one subchronic (65 applications over 13 weeks) were conducted with monitoring for clinical signs, body weight, food and water consumption, hematologic findings, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, gross and microscopic pathology analysis. The first 9 day study with undiluted MDEA (260, 1040, and 2080 mg/kg/day) produced dose-related skin irritation with related hematological and clinical chemistry changes. Adrenal weights were increased, a common finding in cutaneous irritation studies, and kidney weights were increased but without urinalysis or histological evidence of renal injury. Histopathologic investigation was limited to the skin treatment area. The second 9 day study, using aqueous dilutions of MDEA (100, 500, and 750 mg/kg/day) showed local irritation at the mid and high doses with associated clinical chemistry changes and increased adrenal gland weight. There were slight reductions in body weight gain. There were no effects on hematology or urinalysis, and histopathologic findings were limited to the treated skin. The subchronic study, also with aqueous dilutions (100, 250, and 750 mg/kg/day), showed dose-related irritation in the mid and high dose groups; major histopathological features were acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, dermatitis, dermal fibrosis, eschar, and ulceration. Low-dose group findings were similar to the controls, and probably a consequence of the wrapping procedure. There were no effects on clinical pathological findings or organ weights, and histopathological findings were limited to treated skin. These studies show that recurrent application of MDEA produces a dose-related irritant effect, but there is no evidence for systemic cumulative or specific target organ or tissue toxicity.",

Dosages employed were 0, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day and were selected on the basis of maternal toxicity responses determined from a range-finding study. Observations for maternal toxicity included body weight, food consumption, and clinical signs. Prior to scheduled necropsy on gd 21, blood was obtained for hematological study. At necropsy, liver and kidney, which are putative target organs of ethanolamine toxicity, were weighed. Fetuses were evaluated for body weight and for external, visceral, and skeletal anomalies. Severe skin irritation characterized by necrosis, ecchymoses, exfoliation, crusting, excoriation, erythema, and edema was noted in dams receiving 1000 mg/kg/day during the dosing period. Exfoliation, crusting, necrosis, and erythema persisted subsequent to the dosing period, but by sacrifice on gd 21, substantial repair of the dosing site had occurred. In dams receiving 500 mg/kg/day less severe skin irritation was noted, but no local irritation was seen at the dosage of 250 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on maternal body weight; gestational weight gain; food consumption; or liver, kidney, or gravid uterine weights at any of the MDEA-dosed groups. Dams from the 1000 mg/kg/day group had decreases in erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. There were no effects on any gestational parameters, and no increases in the total number of malformations or variations (external, visceral, or skeletal) by category or individually. In conclusion, rat dams showed dose-dependent skin irritation following repeated cutaneous application of MDEA during pregnancy. In addition, maternal toxicity was also present as anemia in dams receiving 1000 mg/kg/day. Despite maternal toxicity, there was no evidence of developmental effects. The no-observed-adverse effect level was 250 mg/kg/day for maternal toxicity, and at or above 1000 mg/kg/day for embryofetal toxicity and teratogenicity.",

Its use as an agent precursor and possible chemical warefare agent will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.0X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N-methyldiethanolamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase N-methyldiethanolamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. N-Methyldiethanolamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, N-methyldiethanolamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. The pKa of N-methyldiethanolamine is 8.52, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the cation from moist soil is not expected because cations do not volatilize. Volatilization of neutral N-methyldiethanolamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. N-Methyldiethanolamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. N-Methyldiethanolamine did not biodegrade after 28 days in activated sludge, but degraded >96% after 40 days in a continuous-flow experiment where the inoculum had time to acclimate. These data indicate that biodegradation of N-methyldiethanolamine in soil and water may only be important under acclimated conditions. If released into water, N-methyldiethanolamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant and pKa. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9).  Occupational exposure to N-methyldiethanolamine may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N-methyldiethanolamine is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population is not expected to be exposed to N-methyldiethanolamine unless released towards people as a chemical warfare agent. (SRC)",

The pKa of N-methyldiethanolamine is 8.52(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Volatilization of the cation from moist soil is not expected because cations do not volatilize(SRC). Volatilization of neutral N-methyldiethanolamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure, 2.0X10-4 mm Hg(5), and assigned value for water solubility of 1X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(6). N-Methyldiethanolamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(5). N-Methyldiethanolamine did not biodegrade after 28 days in activated sludge, but degraded >96% after 40 days in a continuous-flow experiment where the inoculum had time to acclimate(7). These data indicate that biodegradation of N-methyldiethanolamine in soil may only be important under acclimated conditions(7).",

A pKa of 8.52(3) indicates N-methyldiethanolamine will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization of the cation from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Volatilization of neutral N-methyldiethanolamine from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.1X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 2.0X10-4 mm Hg(5), and assigned value for water solubility of 1X10+6 mg/L (miscible)(6). N-Methyldiethanolamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.50(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. N-Methyldiethanolamine did not biodegrade after 28 days in activated sludge, but degraded >96% after 40 days in a continuous-flow experiment where the inoculum had time to acclimate(8). These data indicate that biodegradation of N-methyldiethanolamine in water may only occur under acclimated conditions(8). [",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that N-methyldiethanolamine is expected to be essentially nonvolatile from water and moist soil surfaces(4). N-Methyldiethanolamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(2).",

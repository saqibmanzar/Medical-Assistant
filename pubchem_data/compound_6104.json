For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Peak levels with aqueous preparations are higher and decline faster than those with oily preparations. Regular weekly administration produces a continuous rise in the basal value for several months, after which the serum level becomes relatively stable. After a standard weekly dose, considerable individual variation in the levels of gold can be observed. A steady decline in gold levels occurs when the interval between injections is lengthened, and small amounts may be found in the serum for months after discontinuation of therapy. The incidence of toxic reactions is seemingly unrelated to the plasma level of gold, but may perhaps be more associated with the total cumulative content of gold in the body.",

Gold is absorbed from injection sites, reaching peak concentration in blood in about 4 to 6 hours. After a single intramuscular injection of 50 mg of aurothioglucose suspension in two subjects, peak serum levels were observed at approximately  235 g/dL and 450 g/dL.  Storage of gold in human tissues depends upon organ mass as well as the concentration of gold.Subsequently, tissues having the highest gold levels (w/w) may not necessarily have the largest total amounts of gold. The highest concentrations of gold are generally found in the lymph nodes, adrenal glands, liver, kidneys, bone marrow, and spleen. Relatively small concentrations are actually found in the articular structures. In particular, following the administration of aurothioglucose doses, about 85% of the resultant plasma gold will be stored in the major bodily gold depots, which in decreasing order of total gold content are, the lymph nodes, bone marrow, liver, skin, and bone.",

Peak levels with aqueous preparations are higher and decline faster than those with oily preparations. Weekly administration produces a continuous rise in the basal value for several months, after which the serum level becomes relatively stable. After a standard weekly dose, considerable individual variation in the levels of gold has been found. A steady decline in gold levels occurs when the interval between injections is lengthened, and small amounts may be found in the serum for months after discontinuance of therapy. The incidence of toxic reactions is apparently unrelated to the cumulative body content of gold.",

These attacks are facilitated by various pro-inflammatory immune cells and agents like cytokines, histamines, mast cells, macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, leukocytes, and many others. The longterm result of this unwanted immune response is chronic inflammation and painful tissue damage. The cause of the malfunctioning immune system in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown and there is no definitive cure for the condition.  Similarly, the mechanism of action of aurothioglucose is also not well elucidated. Nevertheless, some studies have suggested that the combination of both the sulfhydryl ligand and aureus cation present in aurothioglucose elicits an inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity in human lymphocyte membranes and in membranes of T and B lymphocyte subsets. In particular, such inhibition of the activity of adenylyl cyclase and its various isoforms would theoretically also limit the cyclases' ability to induce mast cell degranulation and histamine release, to enhance respiratory burst effects, to stimulate the action of resting macrophages, to induce and activate phagocytes, to induce neutrophil chemotaxis, etc. - all of which are pro-inflammatory actions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

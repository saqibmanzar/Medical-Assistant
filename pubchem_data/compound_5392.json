Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The Agency has completed its assessment of the human health and ecological risks associated with the use of pesticides containing the active ingredient temephos of organophosphates as a class. Based on a review of these data and public comments on the Agency's assessments for the active ingredient temephos, EPA has sufficient information on the human health and ecological effects of temephos to make a reregistration eligibility decision. Because temephos has no dietary or residential exposure concerns, it is not subject to further cumulative assessment for other organophosphates. This ... /Reregistration Eligibility Decision document/ identifies risk reduction measures that are necessary to allow the continued use of temephos. Appendix B. identifies the generic data requirements that the Agency reviewed as part of its determination, and lists the submitted studies that the Agency found acceptable. Based on its current evaluation of temephos alone, the Agency has determined that temephos products, unless amended and used as specified in this document, would present risks inconsistent with FIFRA. Accordingly, should the registrant fail to implement any of the risk mitigation measures identified in this /Reregistration Eligibility Decision/ document, the Agency may take regulatory action to address the risk concerns from use of temephos. For temephos, if all changes outlined in this document are incorporated into the labels, then the risks associated with current use patterns will be mitigated.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer saftey standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Temephos is found on List A, which contains most pesticides that are used on foods and, hence, have a high potential for human exposure. List A consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA '88. Case No: 0006; Pesticide type: insecticide; Registration Standard Date: 8/1/81; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the RED document.; Active  ingredient (AI): temephos; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s):  11/21/91, 10/13/95; AI Status:  The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

Rats were administered 20 mg/kg monocrotophos or 8600 mg/kg abate orally. Rats were killed at 1 to 7 days after dosing. An in vitro study was conducted on the inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase by monocrotophos. A maximum inhibition in the enzyme activity in the monocrotophos treated animals occurred on day one with a significant recovery being attained by day three. A second inhibition was noted on day five with a second recovery by day seven. Monocrotophos had no significant effect on the enzyme constant values but the maximum velocity varied, demonstrating a noncompetitive nature. Abate caused changes in both the maximum velocity and the enzyme constant at different time intervals. The in vitro studies with monocrotophos demonstrated an increase in the the enzyme constant with no changes in the the maximum velocity. The in vivo studies showed the the enzyme constant decreased and the maximum velocity varied when compared to control. ...",

Exposure to temephos at 10 times the effective field concentration (EFC; 0.33 mg/L) ...  resulted in a significant reduction in the /critical swimming speed/ of M. duboulayi under controlled conditions.",

Its use for controlling fleas on cats and dogs, and lice on humans may also result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.9X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates temephos will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase temephos will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Sunlight induced photolysis of 600 ppm temephos in methanol produced the corresponding sulfone, and this reaction may also occur in sunlit natural waters. If released to soil, temephos is expected to be immobile based upon a Koc range of 18,250-31,800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Temephos is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A biodegradation half-life of 17.2 days under aquatic conditions suggests that biodegradation may be a moderately important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, temephos is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A biodegradation half-life in water of 17.2 days under aerobic conditions suggests that biodegradaton may be an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An experimental BCF of 2,300 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 5.44X10-4 L/mole-sec corresponding to half-lives of 106 and 105 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, suggests that hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to temephos may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where temephos is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to temephos via ingestion of some fish/seafood and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. Aerial application of temephos over aquatic sites may contaminate surface and drinking waters. (SRC)",

Temephos has been reported to rapidly partition to sediment and suspended organic matter and become strongly adsorbed(3,4). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(5) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(6). According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF of 2,300(2) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). A biodegradation half-life in water of 17.2 days under aerobic conditions(2) suggests that biodegradaton may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The majority of temephos was found associated with organic matter in the pond water. Hydrolysis and oxidation may account for some of the dissipation; however, most of the temephos was adsorbed to organic matter and slowly released to achieve the steady state(1).",

Ten days were required for a decline of temephos concentration to 0.01 ppb. Adsorption by polyethylene played a significant role in temephos disappearance, with a maximum of 1560 ppb adsorbed in <1 day. The rapid adsorption corresponded to rapid partitioning. This was followed by desorption from polyethylene, such that small amounts of insecticide were rereleased into the aqueous phase and, after a time, equilibrium was reached. The behavior of insecticides in artificial ponds may not completely reflect the behavior in natural systems(1).",

As the number of days of incubation increased from 1 to 10, the amount of radioactivity associated with the water soluble, highly polar metabolites increased from 2l to 42% of the total recovered radioactivity. The majority of radioactivity in the organic extraction layer was unchanged temephos. Metabolites consisted of 2 unknowns along with those identified as the sulfoxide, the mono-oxon, the mono-oxon sulfone and the monophenol derivatives of temephos(1). Temephos did not biodegrade after incubation in a natural pond water/sediment system for 7 days(2). Aerobic degradation of a concentration of 31.7 ug/g of temephos was carried out in water/sediment samples at pH 8.0, collected from Lake Mendota, WI. A continuous flow of air and a temperature of 25 \u00b0C was maintained during the experiment. The degradation followed first-order kinetics resulting in a half-life of 17.2 days(3).",

Hydrolysis of temephos at pH 5, 7, and 9 at a concentration of 30 ug/L showed no significant hydrolysis over a 30 day period(2). Under basic conditions, temephos hydrolyzes to 4,4'-thiodiphenol(3). It is hydrolyzed by alkalies and strong acids(4). Sunlight induced photolysis of 600 ppm temephos in methanol produced the corresponding sulfone and this reaction may also occur in sun lit natural waters(5). The reported half-life of C-14 labeled temephos under 24 hours of continuous irradiation (xenon arc lamp) is 15 days (k = 4.3X10-2 days), for 30 ug/L of temephos in unbuffered solutions at pH 6.5 to 7.0 and 25 \u00b0C(2).

Rapid uptake of temephos was observed and primarily intact temephos was detected. However, metabolism of the parent compound to temephos sulfoxide, was the major degradate. Detection of additional metabolites such as 4,4'-thiodiphenol, phosphorthioic acid, O-p-(p-hydroxyohenylthio)phenyl, O,O'-dimethyl ester and phosphoric acid, O-p-(p-hydroxypheny1thio)phenyl dimethyl ester were found(1). According to a classification scheme(2), this BCF suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The results indicated Koc values in loamy sand (Delaware) 18,250, sandy loam (Princeton) 16,250, silt loam (Nebraska) 31,800, and loam (Ontario) 22,800. Temephos adsorption to sediment steadily increased to a maximum after two days of exposure, but temephos degradation products have shown to adsorb less strongly to soils(1).

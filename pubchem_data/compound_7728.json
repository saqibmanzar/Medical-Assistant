When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Based on daily consumption, the attained dosages did not deviate significantly from targets. All treated and control animals survived to terminal necropsy and no overt toxicity was reported in 7-day study. Clinical signs of toxicity included dramatically and statistically significant (p < 0.001) depression of bodyweight gains on Days 1, 4, and 7 in both high dose males and females. Relative to control Group B, growth rates were also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced on Day 7 in 0.40 g/kg/day females. Relative liver weights (as percentage of bodyweight) in 1.0 g/kg/day females were significantly (p < 0.01) elevated relative to those of control Group 2 after 7 days, but not as compared to control Group 1. Microscopic examination of high dose animals failed to identify treatment-related lesions in excess of historical and study controls. Based on bodyweight, liver and kidney weights, and histopathology, the authors reported a maximum no significant ill-effect level (MiE) as 0.40 g/kg/day and calculated a ratio of LD50 (0.566 g/kg) and MiE as 1.44, probably indicating a low degree of chronicity.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.43 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days, respectively. If released to soil, 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 170. 2-Methyl-5-ethylpyridine has a pKa of 6.51, which indicates that this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in moist acidic to neutral soils; cations adsorb more strongly to soils than neutral molecules. Therefore, the mobility of 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is expected to be lower in acidic and neutral soils than in alkaline soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, in moist acidic and neutral soils, where the protonated form is the dominant species, volatilization will not be important because cations do not volatilize. 2-Methyl-5-ethylpyridine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Based on an aerobic column study using aquifer sediment, 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is expected to biodegrade slowly in water or soil. After 35 days of operation, only 43.4% of the initially applied 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine was removed. If released into water, 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 20 days, respectively. In acidic and neutral waters where the protonated form is the dominant species, volatilization will not be an important fate process since cations do not volatilize. An estimated BCF of 14 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine via ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine.

Therefore, the mobility of 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is expected to be much lower in acidic and neutral soils than in alkaline soils(SRC). Volatilization of the neutral species of 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 1.43 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 12,000 mg/l(6). However, the protonated form will not volatilize(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(3). Based on an aerobic column study using aquifer sediment, 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is expected to biodegrade slowly in soil. After 35 days of operation, only 43.4% of the initially applied 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine was removed(4).",

Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure, 1.43 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 12,000 mg/l(9). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 20 days, respectively(SRC). However, the pKa of 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is 6.51(8), indicating this compound will exist in the ionized form in acidic and neutral waters and cations do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 14(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.4(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Based on an aerobic column study using aquifer sediment, 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine is expected to biodegrade slowly in water. After 35 days of operation, only 43.4% of the initially applied 2-methyl-5-ethylpyridine was removed(10).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 2-Methyl-5-ethylpyridine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). 3,5-Lutidine, a structurally-similar alkylated pyridine, has a weak absorption band that extends into the environmental UV spectrum(3), which suggests that direct photolysis is not likely to be an important fate process for alkylated pyridines (SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It enjoyed use as a popular organic solvent in industry and pharmaceutical manufacturing for nearly a century. In 1963, a serendipitous discovery was made by George Carraz during his investigations into the anticonvulsant effects of khelline when he found that all of his samples, dissolved in valproic acid, exerted a similar degree of anticonvulsive activity. It first received approval on February 28, 1978 from the FDA under the trade name Depakene.  Since then, it has been investigated for neuroprotective, anti-manic, and anti-migraine effects. It is currently a compound of interest in the field of oncology for its anti-proliferative effects and is the subject of many clinical trials in a variety of cancer types.",

This agent's antitumor and antiangiogenesis activities may be related to the inhibition of histone deacetylases and nitric oxide synthase, which results in the inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis.

It is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug and is usually well tolerated. Rarely, serious complications may occur in some patients, including hemorrhagic pancreatitis, coagulopathies, bone marrow suppression, VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and encephalopathy, but there is still a lack of knowledge about the incidence and occurrence of these special side effects. VPA has been approved for stabilization of manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. It is also used to treat migraine headaches and schizophrenia. As the use of VPA increases, the number of both accidental and intentional exposures increases. This is paralleled by more reports of VPA-induced toxicity. VPA is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenicity. It is a known folate antagonist, which can cause neural tube defects. Thus, folic acid supplements may alleviate teratogenic problems. Women who become pregnant whilst taking valproate should be counselled as to its risks. VPA is an inhibitor of the enzyme histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). HDAC1 is needed for HIV to remain in infected cells. Patients treated with valproic acid in addition to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed a median 75% reduction in latent HIV infection. VPA is believed to affect the function of the neurotransmitter GABA (as a GABA transaminase inhibitor) in the human brain. Valproic Acid dissociates to the valproate ion in the gastrointestinal tract. (A7818, A7819).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In this study, we evaluated the effect of valproic acid (VPA) in ICR mice with adenomyosis, induced by neonatal dosing with tamoxifen. For all mice, we evaluated the bodyweight and the response to thermal stimuli by hotplate and tail-flick tests 4, 8, and 12 weeks after dosing, respectively, and then treated mice with low- and high-dose of VPA, progesterone (P4), P4 + VPA, or vehicle only. Three weeks after treatment, both bodyweight and thermal response tests were evaluated again before sacrifice, and the depth of myometrial infiltration was evaluated. We found that: (i) the induction of adenomyosis resulted in progressive generalized hyperalgesia as measured by hotplate and tail-flick tests, along with decreased bodyweight; (ii) treatment with VPA, P4, or a combination was efficacious in improving generalized hyperalgesia; and (iii) drug treatment appeared to reduce the myometrial infiltration, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Thus, VPA seems to be a promising therapeutics for treating adenomyosis, as reported recently in some case series in humans.",

Combining hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors produces synergistic anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of this evidence, /this study/ conducted a phase I study of the combination of 5-AZA and valproic acid in patients with advanced cancers. Experimental Design: 5-AZA was administered s.c. daily for 10 days. Valproic acid was given orally daily with a goal to titrate to plasma levels of 75 to 100 mug/mL (therapeutic for seizures). Cycles were 28 days long. 5-AZA was started at 20 mg/m(2) and escalated using an adaptive algorithm based on the toxicity profile in the prior cohort (6 + 6 design). Peripheral blood mononuclear cell global DNA methylation and histone H3 acetylation were estimated with the long interspersed nucleotide elements pyrosequencing assay and Western blots, respectively, on days 1 and 10 of each cycle when patients agreed to provide them. Results: Fifty-five patients were enrolled. Median age was 60 years (range, 12-77 years). The maximum tolerated dose was 75 mg/m(2) of 5-AZA in combination with valproic acid. Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenic fever and thrombocytopenia, which occurred at a dose of 94 mg/m(2) of 5-AZA. Stable disease lasting 4 to 12 months (median, 6 months) was observed in 14 patients (25%). A significant decrease in global DNA methylation and induction of histone acetylation were observed. Conclusion: The combination of 5-AZA and valproic acid is safe at doses up to 75 mg/m(2) for 5-AZA in patients with advanced malignancies.",

Rats with guide cannular implanted bilaterally were divided into three groups and either saline or valproic acid (100 or 300 ug/0.5 uL/side) was microinjected into the NAcc once daily for 7 days. On day 8, half of each group received either saline or AMPH (1mg/kg, i.p.), respectively, and locomotor activity was measured for 2 hr. The increases of both horizontal locomotion and rearing by AMPH were attenuated in the rat pre-treated with valproic acid compared to saline in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that neuronal modifications in the NAcc induced by chronic valproic acid can modulate amphetamine-induced locomotor activity.",

Epigenetic modifications are observed universally during the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. The development of epigenetic-modulating agents utilizing the synergism between hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors provides a novel therapeutic approach in treating NSCLC. Methods: /This study/ performed a phase I trial combining 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and valproic acid (VPA), in patients with advanced stage NSCLC. Patients were treated with escalating doses of decitabine (5-15 mg/sq m) IV for 10 days in combination with VPA (10-20 mg/kg/day) PO on days 5-21 of a 28-day cycle. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis included decitabine pharmacokinetics and fetal hemoglobin expression. Results: Eight patients were accrued to this phase I study. All patients had advanced NSCLC and had received prior chemotherapy. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0-2. Major toxicities included myelosuppression and neurotoxicity. Dose-limiting toxicity was seen in two patients suffering grade 3 neurotoxicity during cycle one including disorientation, lethargy, memory loss, and ataxia at dose level 1. One patient had grade 3 neutropenia at the de-escalated dose. No objective response was observed, and stable disease was seen in one patient. Fetal hemoglobin levels increased after cycle one in all seven patients with evaluable results. Conclusions: /This study/ observed that decitabine and valproic acid are an effective combination in reactivating hypermethylated genes as demonstrated by re-expressing fetal hemoglobin. This combination in patients with advanced stage IV NSCLC, however, is limited by unacceptable neurological toxicity at a relatively low dosage. Combining hypomethylating agents with alternative HDAC inhibitors that lack the toxicity of VPA should be explored further.",

Hepatotoxicity: General Population: Hepatic failure resulting in fatalities has occurred in patients receiving valproate. These incidents usually have occurred during the first six months of treatment. Serious or fatal hepatotoxicity may be preceded by non-specific symptoms such as malaise, weakness, lethargy, facial edema, anorexia, and vomiting. In patients with epilepsy, a loss of seizure control may also occur. Patients should be monitored closely for appearance of these symptoms. Serum liver tests should be performed prior to therapy and at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the first six months.  Children under the age of two years are at a considerably increased risk of developing fatal hepatotoxicity, especially those on multiple anticonvulsants, those with congenital metabolic disorders, those with severe seizure disorders accompanied by mental retardation, and those with organic brain disease. When Depakene products are used in this patient group, they should be used with extreme caution and as a sole agent. The benefits of therapy should be weighed against the risks. The incidence of fatal hepatotoxicity decreases considerably in progressively older patient groups. Patients with Mitochondrial Disease: There is an increased risk of valproate-induced acute liver failure and resultant deaths in patients with hereditary neurometabolic syndromes caused by DNA mutations of the mitochondrial DNA Polymerase gamma (POLG) gene (e.g. Alpers Huttenlocher Syndrome). Depakene is contraindicated in patients known to have mitochondrial disorders caused by POLG mutations and children under two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a mitochondrial disorder. In patients over two years of age who are clinically suspected of having a hereditary mitochondrial disease, Depakene should only be used after other anticonvulsants have failed. This older group of patients should be closely monitored during treatment with Depakene for the development of acute liver injury with regular clinical assessments and serum liver testing. POLG mutation screening should be performed in accordance with current clinical practice. Fetal Risk: Valproate can cause major congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects (e.g., spina bifida). In addition, valproate can cause decreased IQ scores following in utero exposure.  Valproate should only be used to treat pregnant women with epilepsy if other medications have failed to control their symptoms or are otherwise unacceptable.  Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless the drug is essential to the management of her medical condition. This is especially important when valproate use is considered for a condition not usually associated with permanent injury or death (e.g., migraine). Women should use effective contraception while using valproate. Pancreatitis: Cases of life-threatening pancreatitis have been reported in both children and adults receiving valproate. Some of the cases have been described as hemorrhagic with a rapid progression from initial symptoms to death. Cases have been reported shortly after initial use as well as after several years of use. Patients and guardians should be warned that abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia can be symptoms of pancreatitis that require prompt medical evaluation. If pancreatitis is diagnosed, valproate should ordinarily be discontinued. Alternative treatment for the underlying medical condition should be initiated as clinically indicated.",

It also improves symptom control in bipolar mania. Although the exact mechanisms responsible are unknown, it is thought that valproate produces increased cortical inhibition to contribute to control of neural synchrony. It is also thought that valproate exerts a neuroprotective effect preventing damage and neural degeneration in epilepsy, migraines, and bipolar disorder.  Valproate is hepatotoxic and teratogenic. The reasons for this are unclear but have been attributed to the genomic effects of the drug.  A small proof-of concept study found that valproate increases clearance of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) when combined with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) by reactivating the virus to allow clearance, however, a larger multicentre trial failed to show a significant effect on HIV reservoirs when added to HAART. The FDA labeling contains a warning regarding HIV reactivation during valproate use..",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

To establish the method to determine placenta transfer in non-human primate, toxicokinetics of valproic acid (VPA), a drug used to treat epilepsy in pregnant women, were determined in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys. After mating, pregnancy-proven females were daily administered with VPA at dose levels of 0, 20, 60 and 180 mg/kg by oral route during the organogenesis period from gestation day (GD) 20 to 50. Concentrations of VPA and its metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, in maternal plasma on GDs 20 and 50, and concentrations of VPA and 4-ene-VPA in placenta, amniotic fluid and fetus on GD 50 were analyzed using LC/MS/MS. Following single oral administration of VPA to pregnant monkeys, concentrations of VPA and 4-ene-VPA were generally quantifiable in the plasma from all treatment groups up to 4-24 hours post-dose, demonstrating that VPA was absorbed and the monkeys were systemically exposed to VPA and 4-ene-VPA. After repeated administration of VPA to the monkeys, VPA was detected in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetus from all treatment groups, demonstrating that VPA was transferred via placenta and the fetus was exposed to VPA, and the exposures were increased with increasing dose. Concentrations of 4-ene-VPA in amniotic fluid and fetus were below the limit of quantification, but small amount of 4-ene-VPA was detected in placenta. In conclusion, pregnant monkeys were exposed to VPA and 4-ene-VPA after oral administration of VPA at dose levels of 20, 60 and 180 mg/kg during the organogenesis period. VPA was transferred via placenta and the fetus was exposed to VPA with dose-dependent exposure. The metabolite, 4-ene VPA, was not detected in both amniotic fluid and fetus, but small amount of 4-ene-VPA was detected in placenta. These results demonstrated that proper procedures to investigate placenta transfer in NHP, such as mating and diagnosis of pregnancy via examining gestational sac with ultrasonography, collection of amniotic fluid, placenta and fetus after Caesarean section followed by adequate bioanalysis and toxicokinetic analysis, were established in this study using cynomolugus monkeys.",

VPA was administrated orally in rats in amounts ranging from 20 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg. Free and total (free plus glucuronide conjugated) VPA, 4-ene VPA, and 2,4-diene VPA were quantified in urine and liver using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alpha-glutathione S-transferase (alpha-GST) were also determined to measure the level of hepatotoxicity. The serum alpha-GST level increased slightly at the 20 mg/kg dose, and substantially increased at the 100 and 500 mg/kg dose; aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels did not change with the administration of increasing doses of VPA. The liver concentration of free 4-ene VPA and the urinary excretion of total 4-ene VPA were the only measures that correlated with the increase in the serum alpha-GST level (p < 0.094 and p < 0.023 respectively). From these results, /it is concluded/ that hepatotoxicity of VPA correlates with liver concentration of 4-ene VPA and can be predicted by the urinary excretion of total 4-ene VPA.",

It shows high inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and has a narrow therapeutic range. /This study/ evaluated the effects of polymorphic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A6 (541A>G, 552A>C) metabolizing enzyme on the pharmacokinetics of sodium valproate in the patients with epilepsy who showed toxicity to therapy. METHODS: Genotype analysis of the patients was made with polymerase chain-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with sequencing. Plasma drug concentrations were measured with reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and concentration-time data were analyzed by using a non-compartmental approach. RESULTS: The results of this study suggested a significant genotypic as well as allelic association with valproic acid toxicity for UGT1A6 (541A>G) or UGT1A6 (552A>C) polymorphic enzymes. The elimination half-life (t 1/2 = 40.2 hr) of valproic acid was longer and the clearance rate (CL = 917 mL/hr) was lower in the poor metabolizers group of UGT1A6 (552A>C) polymorphism who showed toxicity than in the intermediate metabolizers group (t 1/2= 35.5 hr, CL = 1,022 mL/hr) or the extensive metabolizers group (t 1/2= 25.4 hr, CL = 1,404 mL/hr). CONCLUSION: /These/ findings suggest that the UGT1A6 (552A>C) genetic polymorphism plays a significant role in the steady state concentration of valproic acid, and it thereby has an impact on the toxicity of the valproic acid used in the patients with epilepsy.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

                                            "String": "The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.  Valproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase. This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity. A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.  It has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK). These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.  Valproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase. This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect. Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-\u03b1 and -\u03b5 which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium. The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis. Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.  Valproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism. Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action. Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase. Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.  Finally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated. The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients. Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong. H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.",

The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism underlying VPA-induced attenuation of microglia over-activation using rodent primary neuron/glia or enriched glia cultures. Other histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) were compared with VPA for their effects on microglial activity. We found that VPA induced apoptosis of microglia cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. VPA-treated microglial cells showed typical apoptotic hallmarks including phosphatidylserine externalization, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Further studies revealed that trichostatin A (TSA) and sodium butyrate (SB), two structurally dissimilar HDACIs, also induced microglial apoptosis. The apoptosis of microglia was accompanied by the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and the enhancement of acetylation levels of the histone H3 protein. Moreover, pretreatment with SB or TSA caused a robust decrease in LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses and protected DA neurons from damage in mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures. Taken together, /these/ results shed light on a novel mechanism whereby HDACIs induce neuroprotection and underscore the potential utility of HDACIs in preventing inflammation-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.",

Given that VPA alters mitochondrial functions, an action of this drug on a mitochondrial process such as steroid synthesis in adrenal cells should be expected. In order to disclose a putative action of VPA on the adrenocortical cell itself /this study/ evaluated VPA effects on regulatory steps of the acute stimulation of steroidogenesis in Y1 adrenocortical cells. This study demonstrates that VPA increases progesterone production in non-stimulated cells without inducing the levels of Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory (StAR) protein, which facilitates cholesterol transport. This result suggests that VPA increases mitochondrial cholesterol transport through a StAR-independent mechanism and is further supported by the fact that in isolated mitochondria VPA stimulates exogenous cholesterol metabolization to progesterone. VPA also reduces the cAMP-mediated increase of the StAR protein, mRNA levels, promoter activity and progesterone production. In summary, the present data show that VPA can alter steroid production in adrenal cells by a complex mechanism that mainly involves an action on cholesterol access to the inner mitochondrial membrane. The VPA-mediated increase of basal steroidogenesis could be linked to the increase of basal cortisolemia described in patients under VPA treatment.",

In this study the cellular pathways involved in VPA hepatotoxicity were investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes. Accelerated cytotoxicity mechanism screening (ACMS) techniques using fluorescent probes including, ortho-phthalaldehyde, rhodamine 123 and acridine orange were applied for measurement of ROS formation, glutathione depletion, mitochondrial membrane potential and Lysosomal membrane damage, respectively. /This studies/ results showed that cytotoxic action of VPA is mediated by lysosomal membrane leakiness along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and decline of mitochondrial membrane potential before cell lysis ensued. Incubation of hepatocytes with VPA also caused rapid hepatocyte glutathione (GSH) depletion which is another marker of cellular oxidative stress. Most of the VPA induced GSH depletion could be attributed to the expulsion of GSSG. /These/ results also showed that CYP2EI is involved in the mechanism of VPA cytotoxicity. /It is concluded/ VPA hepatotoxicity is a result of metabolic activation by CYP2E1 and ROS formation, leading to lysosomal labialization, mitochondrial/lysosomal toxic cross-talk and finally general cellular proteolysis in the rat hepatocytes.",

Valpromide (VPD), the amide derivative of VPA, does not inhibit HDAC activity and is a weak teratogen in vivo. The detailed mechanism of action of VPA as a teratogen is not known. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that VPA disrupts regulation of the expression of genes that are critical in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during limb development. Murine gestation day-12 embryonic forelimbs were excised and exposed to VPA or VPD in a limb bud culture system. VPA caused a significant concentration- dependent increase in limb abnormalities, which was correlated with its HDAC inhibitory effect. The signaling of both Sox9 and Runx2, key regulators of chondrogenesis, was downregulated by VPA. In contrast, VPD had little effect on limb morphology and no significant effect on HDAC activity or the expression of marker genes. Thus, VPA exposure dysregulated the expression of target genes directly involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the developing limb. Disturbances in these signaling pathways are likely to be a consequence of HDAC inhibition because VPD did not affect their expressions.",

An LC-MS-based metabolomics approach was undertaken in order to detect urinary VPA metabolites and to discover early biomarkers of the adverse effects induced by VPA. RESULTS: CD-1 mice were either subcutaneously injected with 600-mg VPA/kg body weight or vehicle only, and urine samples were collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hr postinjection. A metabolomics approach combined with principal component analysis was utilized to identify VPA-related metabolites and altered endogenous metabolites in urine. Some VPA metabolites indicated potential liver toxicity caused by VPA administration. Additionally, some altered endogenous metabolites suggested that renal function might be perturbed by VPA dosing. CONCLUSION: LC-MS-based metabolomics is capable of rapidly profiling VPA drug metabolites and is a powerful tool for the discovery of potential early biomarkers related to perturbations in liver and kidney function.",

Body weight is found to decrease with the 100-mg/kg/d dose and significantly decrease with the 500-mg/kg/d dose. Mean excreted urine volume is lowest in the 500-mg/kg/d group among all groups. The plasma level of alpha-glutathione-S-transferase, a sensitive and earlier biomarker for hepatotoxicity, increases significantly with administration of 100 and 500 mg/kg/d; however, there is not a significant difference in alpha-glutathione-S-transferase plasma levels between the control and 20-mg/kg/d groups. Clusters in partial least squares discriminant analysis score plots show similar patterns, with changes in physiological conditions and plasma levels of alpha-glutathione-S-transferase; the cluster for the control and 20-mg/kg/d groups does not clearly separate, but the clusters are separate for 100- and 500-mg/kg/d groups. A biomarker of hepatotoxicity, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and octanoylcarnitine, is identified from nontargeted and targeted metabolic profiling. These results validate that metabolic profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry could be a useful tool for finding novel biomarkers. Thus, a nontargeted metabolic profiling method is established to evaluate the hepatotoxicity of valproic acid and demonstrates proof-of-concept that metabolomic approach with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has great potential for predicting valproic acid-induced hepatotoxicity and discovering novel biomarkers.",

The aim of this work was to design an alternative testing method based on human embryonic stem cells for the detection of prenatal neural toxicity. For this purpose ... a model based on the generation of neural rosettes /was created/, reproducing in vitro the gastrulation events recapitulating the formation of the neural tube in vivo. To validate the model ...  this complex cell system /was exposed/ to increasing concentrations of valproic acid, a known teratogenic agent, to analyze the morphological and molecular changes induced by the toxicant. Specific assays were applied to discriminate between cytotoxicity and specific neural toxicity. Transcriptomic analysis was performed with a microarray Affimetrix platform and validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR for the expression of genes involved in early neural development, neural tube formation and neural cells migration, key biological processes in which the effect of valproic acid is most relevant. The results demonstrated that neural rosette cells respond to valproic acid exposure with molecular and morphological changes similar to those observed in vivo, indicating that this method represents a promising alternative test for the detection of human prenatal neural toxicity.",

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions. This chemical is incompatible with bases, oxidizing agents and reducing agents. It is corrosive. (NTP, 1992).",

Valproic acid is an antiepileptic drug and is used solely or in combination with other anticonvulsants in the treatment of simple (petit mal) and complex absence seizures.  Valproic acid may be effective against myoclonic and atonic seizures in young children.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: After oral administration, the drug is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and metabolized in the liver.  Fatal hepatic failure has been reported in patients on valproic acid therapy, especially those on chronic use. Pancreatitis has also been reported in patients receiving normal therapeutic dosage.  Reports showed that acute toxicity is rare, and usually follows a benign course. The most commonly reported adverse effects are anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Central nervous system effects include drowsiness, possibly apathy and withdrawal, confusion, restlessness, hyperactivity. Less frequently, seizures and coma may occur. Sedative effects are more pronounced when drug is used together with other anti-epileptic agents.  Hematopoietic system effects include thrombocytopenia, abnormal bleeding time and partial thromboplastin time with decreased fibrinogen levels and prolonged prothrombin time leading to bruising, petechiae, hematoma, and epistaxis.  The drug can induce pruritic macular rashes and transient alopecia. Altered thyroid functions was described. Death is rare but if it occurs it results from cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to hepatic failure.  Safe use of valproic acid during pregnancy has not been established.  Although several reports suggest an association between the use of valproic acid in pregnant epileptic women and an increased incidence of birth defects (particularly neural tube defects) in children born to these women, a causal relationship remains to be established. The drug crosses the placental barrier and has been found in breast milk. The mechanism of action of valproic acid is unknown.  Effects of the drug may be related, at least in part, to increased brain concentrations of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.   ANIMAL STUDIES: Animal studies have shown that valproic acid inhibits GABA transferase and succinic aldehyde dehydrogenase, enzymes which are important for GABA catabolism.  Results of one study indicate the drug inhibits neuronal activity by increasing potassium conductance.  In animals, valproic acid protects against seizure induced by electrical stimulation, as well as those induced by pentylenetetrazol. In 2 year rat and chronic mouse studies, an increased incidence of subcutaneous fibrosarcoma occurred in male rats at the higher dosage level and a dose related trend for an increased incidence of benign pulmonary adenomas was observed in male mice.  The importance of these findings to humans is not known.  Adverse fetal effects have been observed in reproduction studies in rats and mice.  Studies have not shown any evidence of mutagenic potential for the drug.",

This leads to increased brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Acute poisoning by VPA can lead to severe CNS depression including coma, confusion, somnolence, dizziness or hallucinations.  Hypotension, respiratory depression and hypo/hyperthermia are also common. VPA is also hepatotoxic, which is likely due to its mitochondrial toxicity. VPA appears to exert its mitochondrial toxicity by impairing mitochondrial functions leading to oxidative stress and cytochrome c expulsion, which leads to apoptosis (A15078). VPA is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenicity. VPA is a known folate antagonist, which can cause neural tube defects in developing fetuses. Thus, folic acid supplements in pregnant women may alleviate teratogenic problems associated with VPA use. VPA and its metabolites inhibit the biosynthesis of carnitine by decreasing the concentration of alpha-ketoglutarate (through direct inhibition of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) and may contribute to carnitine deficiency. It is postulated that carnitine supplementation may increase the beta-oxidation of VPA, thereby limiting cytosolic omega-oxidation and the production of toxic metabolites that are involved in liver toxicity and ammonia accumulation. VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and hyperammonemic encephalopathy may be promoted either by a pre-existing carnitine deficiency or by deficiency induced by VPA per se.  VPA has been shown to downregulate levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), histone deacetylase (HDAC) and folate. It has also been shown to upregulate H2O2 and homocysteine. Elevated levels of H2O2 negatively affect the NADPH reducing system for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (A15079).",

More importantly and not uncommonly, valproate can cause several forms of clinically apparent hepatotoxicity.

This syndrome typically presents with progressive and episodic confusion followed by obtundation and coma.

The diagnosis is made by the finding of elevations in serum ammonia with normal (or near normal) serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels. Valproate levels are usually normal or minimally high. The syndrome resolves within a few days of stopping valproate, but may reverse more rapidly with carnitine supplementation or renal hemodialysis.",

Metabolic acidosis is also common and the syndrome can be rapidly fatal.

Rarely, it can cause blood dyscrasia, impaired liver function, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged coagulation times. In about 5% of pregnant users, valproic acid will cross the placenta and cause congenital anomalies. Valproic acid may also cause acute hematological toxicities, especially in children, including rare reports of myelodysplasia and acute leukemia-like syndrome (L1132). May cause a potentially dangerous rash that may develop into Stevens Johnson syndrome, an extremely rare but potentially fatal skin disease. Acute overdoses of VPA can lead to hypo/hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory depression, coma, confusion, somnolence, dizziness, headaches and cerebral edema. Extended use of VPA can cause hepatotoxicity.  Allopecia, anorexia, renal failure, tremors and miosis are also associated with chronic toxicity.  VPA is a known teratogen (due to folate antagonism). The teratogenicity of VPA is mostly found at genetic and somatic levels, causing teratogenesis involving neural tube defects (NTDs), anencephaly, lumbosacral meningomyelocele, and leg dysfunction due to spina bifida aperta.",

However, divalproex is rapidly metabolized in the body to the active drug valproic acid. Valproic acid levels in breastmilk are low and infant serum levels range from undetectable to low. Breastfeeding during valproic acid monotherapy does not appear to adversely affect infant growth or development, and breastfed infants had higher IQs and enhanced verbal abilities than nonbreastfed infants at 6 years of age in one study. A safety scoring system finds valproic acid possible to use during breastfeeding. If valproic acid is required by the mother, it is not necessarily a reason to discontinue breastfeeding.",

The petechiae resolved 35 days after discontinuing breastfeeding and the infant's platelet count had almost reached the normal range by this time. By day 83, the infant's platelet count was well within the normal range. The authors believed the adverse effect to be caused by valproic acid in breastmilk.

A similar medication, divalproex (Depakote\u00ae), breaks down into valproic acid in the body.The Food and Drug Administration recommends that people who are pregnant do not take valproate sodium and related products, valproic acid and divalproex sodium to prevent migraine headaches. For epilepsy or bipolar disorder, valproate products should only be prescribed during pregnancy if other medications are not effective in treating the condition or cannot be used for another reason.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

Studies have found that taking valproic acid in pregnancy is associated with a chance of having a baby with fetal valproate spectrum disorder which includes minor and major birth defects. Birth defects are typically classified as major if they need surgery to be repaired. Some of the birth defects that are more likely to happen include heart defects, cleft lip (when the lip does not form correctly and needs surgery to repair after birth), or neural tube defects (an opening in the baby\u2019s spine or skull). Some babies exposed to valproic acid might also have more minor birth defects like facial differences, such as a thin upper lip. The chance of a birth defect seems to be greater with higher doses of valproic acid or with taking it with another seizure medication.The most common neural tube defect linked to valproic acid use is spina bifida (opening in the spine). The chance of a neural tube defect when taking valproic acid is approximately 1 in 50 to 1 in 100 (1-2%). Taking extra folic acid before trying to get pregnant and in early pregnancy might help lower the chance of some birth defects in pregnancies exposed to valproic acid. Talk to your healthcare provider about how much folic acid you should take.

Although the rate of valproate ion absorption may vary with the formulation administered (liquid, solid, or sprinkle), conditions of use (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the method of administration (e.g., whether the contents of the capsule are sprinkled on food or the capsule is taken intact), these differences should be of minor clinical importance under the steady state conditions achieved in chronic use in the treatment of epilepsy. Food has a greater influence on the rate of absorption of the Depakote tablet (increases Tmax from 4 to 8 hours) than on the absorption of Depakote sprinkle capsules (increase Tmax from 3.3 to 4.8 hours).

Control any seizures first. Some experimental and clinical data suggest that early intravenous supplementation with l-carnitine could improve survival in severe VPA-induced hepatotoxicity. Carnitine administration has been shown to speed the decrease of ammonemia in patients with VPA-induced encephalopathy. As it does not appear to be harmful, l-carnitine is commonly recommended in severe VPA poisoning, especially in children (A15080). In case of inhalation, move patient to fresh air, monitor for respiratory distress. If the exposure occurred via eye contact, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room temperature water for at least 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area thoroughly with soap and water if the exposure occurred via dermal contact. (T36).\n",

Rare postmarketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.",

In a clinical trial of /valproate/ (divalproex sodium) as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets </= 75 x 10+9/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of >/= 110 ug/mL (females) or >/= 135 ug/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects.  Because of reports of thrombocytopenia, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen), platelet counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving Depakene (valproic acid) be monitored for platelet count and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.",

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying this developmental neurotoxicity of VPA is unclear despite previous research demonstrating that VPA could induce widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in developing brains of animal models. This study characterizes the role of astrocytes in VPA-induced neurodegeneration. In developing brains, /this study/ evaluated the developmental neurotoxicity of VPA on differentiating neurons and astrocytes from neural progenitor cells cultured from the hippocampus of human fetuses. Exposure of a neuron-enriched culture to VPA at 250uM or 500uM did not cause neuronal apoptosis, but at 1mM and 7 days exposure, a slight increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells was observed. In contrast, VPA at 250 uM to 1mM, selectively induced neuronal apoptosis in a neuron-astrocyte mixed cell culture model. The VPA-treated astrocytes showed morphological changes, and the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was elevated in the supernatant. Both neuronal apoptosis and TNF-alpha release from astrocytes increased with concentration and exposure time to VPA, suggesting a synergism between the two cell types. Treatment of the neuron-astrocyte mixed culture exposed to VPA with TNF-alpha antibody partly prevented neuronal apoptosis, while the addition of exogenous TNF-alpha induced apoptosis in both cultures. Moreover, this pro-apoptotic effect was specific to VPA, as another AED, valpromide, failed to mimic this pro-apoptotic effect, nor did an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (iHDAC), sodium butyrate (NaB). /This reports/ a novel finding that astrocytes participate in VPA induced neurodegeneration by releasing TNF-alpha.",

The tumor status when starting the drug was: no measurable disease in 12, measurable but stable disease in 12, and measurable progressive disease in 22 patients. Average trough blood levels of VPA were 99 mg/L. The most frequent complaint was somnolence (three patients), but no severe toxicity was reported. One relapse patient responded, early progression of disease was observed in three frontline patients and in six relapsed patients. Median overall survival duration for all patients was 1.33 years, with large differences between first-line (5-year overall survival, 44%) and relapse therapy (5-year overall survival, 14%). This shows that valproate is safe in this patient population. The moderate tumor efficacy encourages studying the drug further as an element of multi-agent protocols.",

Although it is usually well tolerated, a severe hepatotoxic reaction has been repeatedly reported after VPA administration. A profound toxic reaction on administration of VPA has been observed in several patients carrying POLG mutations, and heterozygous genetic variation in POLG has been strongly associated with VPA-induced liver toxicity. /This research studied/ the effect of VPA in fibroblasts of five patients carrying pathogenic mutations in the POLG gene. VPA administration caused a significant increase in the expression of POLG and several regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. It was further supported by elevated mtDNA copy numbers. The effect of VPA on mitochondrial biogenesis was observed in both control and patient cell lines, but the capacity of mutant POLG to increase the expression of mitochondrial genes and to increase mtDNA copy numbers was less effective. No evidence of substantive differences in DNA methylation across the genome was observed between POLG mutated patients and controls. Given the marked perturbation of gene expression observed in the cell lines studied, we conclude that altered DNA methylation is unlikely to make a major contribution to POLG-mediated VPA toxicity. /This/ data provide experimental evidence that VPA triggers increased mitochondrial biogenesis by altering the expression of several mitochondrial genes; however, the capacity of POLG-deficient liver cells to address the increased metabolic rate caused by VPA administration is significantly impaired.",

Many candidate molecules for its teratogenicity have been suggested by recent molecular biological studies. Wnt signal pathways, which are involved in various developmental events in the embryo, consist of many transcription factors such as Dishevelled (Dvl), Frizzled, Axin, and so on. Cxxc finger 4 (Cxxc4) has been identified as a negative regulator of Dvl, and is required for the development of anterior neural tissues in Xenopus. Since defects in Wnt cascade molecules are known to cause mouse NTDs, /it is/ hypothesized that Cxxc4 is one of the target molecules for VPA teratogenicity in the mouse neural tube. /A previous study/ measured the mRNA level of Cxxc4 in the cephalic regions of NMRI mice embryos injected once with VPA (800 mg/kg) on gestation day 8.5 in GeneChip analysis. One, three and six hours after VPA treatment, the Cxxc4 mRNA level was enhanced to 171%, 203% and 141%, respectively, compared to the vehicle control. In this study, whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) was carried out to determine the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Cxxc4 mRNA in the mouse embryo. Cxxc4 expression was detected at the mesencephalic and dorsal midline, where neural tube closure occurs. This pattern was not changed by VPA treatment. These results, taken together, indicate that VPA may up-regulate Cxxc4 and disrupt the Dvl-mediated Wnt signal pathway.",

Previous studies demonstrated that VPA, a direct inhibitor of histone deacetylase, can induce histone hyperacetylation and other epigenetic changes such as histone methylation and DNA demethylation. The objective of this study was to determine if maternal exposure to VPA in mice has the ability to cause these epigenetic alterations in the embryo and thus contribute to its mechanism of teratogenesis. Pregnant CD-1 mice (GD 9.0) were administered a teratogenic dose of VPA (400mg/kg, s.c.) and embryos extracted 1, 3, 6, and 24h after injection. To assess embryonic histone acetylation and histone methylation, Western blotting was performed on whole embryo homogenates, as well as immunohistochemical staining on embryonic sections. To measure DNA methylation changes, the cytosine extension assay was performed. Results demonstrated that a significant increase in histone acetylation that peaked 3h after VPA exposure was accompanied by an increase in histone methylation at histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and a decrease in histone methylation at histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9). Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased histone acetylation in the neuroepithelium, heart, and somites. A decrease in methylated histone H3K9 staining was observed in the neuroepithelium and somites, METHYLATED histone H3K4 staining was observed in the neuroepithelium. No significant differences in global or CpG island DNA methylation were observed in embryo homogenates. These results support the possibility that epigenetic modifications caused by VPA during early mouse organogenesis results in congenital malformations.",

To explore the mechanisms of VPA-induced steatosis, /this study/ profiled the gene expression patterns of the mouse liver that were altered by treatment with VPA using microarray analysis. VPA was orally administered as a single dose of 100 mg/kg (low-dose) or 1000 mg/kg (high-dose) to ICR mice and the animals were killed at 6, 24, or 72 hr after treatment. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were not significantly altered in the experimental animals. However, symptoms of steatosis were observed at 72 hr with low-dose and at 24 hr and 72 hr with high-dose. After microarray data analysis, 1910 genes were selected by two-way ANOVA (P<0.05) as VPA-responsive genes. Hierarchical clustering revealed that gene expression changes depended on the time rather than the dose of VPA treatment. Gene profiling data showed striking changes in the expression of genes associated with lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism, oncogenesis, signal transduction, and development. Functional categorization of 1156 characteristically up- and down-regulated genes (cutoff >1.5-fold) revealed that 60 genes were involved in lipid metabolism that was interconnected with biological pathways for biosynthesis of triglyceride and cholesterol, catabolism of fatty acid, and lipid transport. This gene expression profile may be associated with the known steatogenic hepatotoxicity of VPA and it may provide useful information for prediction of hepatotoxicity of unknown chemicals or new drug candidates through pattern recognition.",

Acute hepatotoxicity of VPA has been well documented by biochemical studies and microarray analysis, but little is known about the chronic effects of VPA in the liver. /The present investigation/ profiled gene expression patterns in the mouse liver after subchronic treatment with VPA. VPA was administered orally at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day or 500 mg/kg/day to ICR mice, and the livers were obtained after 1, 2, or 4 weeks. The activities of serum liver enzymes did not change, whereas triglyceride concentration increased significantly. Microarray analysis revealed that 1325 genes of a set of 32,996 individual genes were VPA responsive when examined by two-way ANOVA (P<0.05) and fold change (>1.5). Consistent with our previous results obtained using an acute VPA exposure model (Lee et al., Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 220:45-59, 2007), the most significantly over-represented biological terms for these genes included lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism. Biological pathway analysis suggests that the genes responsible for increased biosynthesis of cholesterol and triglyceride, and for decreased fatty acid beta-oxidation contribute to the abnormalities in lipid metabolism induced by subchronic VPA treatment. A comparison of the VPA-responsive genes in the acute and subchronic models extracted 15 commonly altered genes, such as Cyp4a14 and Adpn, which may have predictive power to distinguish the mode of action of hepatotoxicants. /This/ data /provides/ a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity and useful information to predict steatogenic hepatotoxicity.",

Pregnancy registry data show that maternal valproate use can cause neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations and malformations involving various body systems). The rate of congenital malformations among babies born to mothers using valproate is about four times higher than the rate among babies born to epileptic mothers using other anti-seizure monotherapies. Evidence suggests that folic acid supplementation prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy decreases the risk for congenital neural tube defects in the general population... Women with epilepsy who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant should not be treated with valproate unless other treatments have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. In such women, the benefits of treatment with valproate during pregnancy may still outweigh the risks.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.5X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates valproic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase valproic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 17 hours. Valproic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, valproic acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 47. The pKa of valproic acid is 4.6, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, valproic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa indicates valproic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to valproic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where valproic acid is produced or used. Exposure to valproic acid among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug. (SRC)",

The pKa of valproic acid is 4.60(4), indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Valproic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 8.5X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

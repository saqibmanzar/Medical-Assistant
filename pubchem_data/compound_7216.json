It is used selectively to control wild oats, black grass, and annual meadow grass in barley, wheat, peas, lentils, rye, maize, beets, brassicas, carrots, and onions. Thiocarbamates are mainly used in agriculture as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides.  Additional uses are as biocides for industrial or other commercial applications, and in household products.  Some are used for vector control in public health. Thiocarbamates are mostly liquids or solids with low melting points. Sulfallate has a possible link to an increased risk of developing cancer in humans. The carcinogenicity of the substance may be influenced by the duration and level of exposure. ",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The quantitative relationships indicate that the thiocarbamates yield chloroacroleins on metabolic activation with the mixed function oxidase system alone, while the intermediate S-oxidation products were detoxified on diversion to chloroallylthiols when the glutathione/glutathione-S-transferase system was also present. The major mouse microsomal mixed function oxidase metabolites of three cmpd were identified by HPLC cochromatography as the corresponding sulfoxides. It was concluded that the formation of mutagenic chloroacroleins involves primarily sulfoxidation of diallate followed by sigmatropic rearrangement-1,2-elimination reactions and S-methylene hydroxylation of triallate and sulfallate and then decomposition of their alpha-hydroxy intermediates. Competing glutathione-S-transferase catalyzed conjugations with glutathione divert the sulfoxidized intermediates from activation involving chloroacrolein formation to detoxification on chloroallylthiol liberation.",

They are eliminated quite rapidly, mainly via expired air and urine. Two major pathways exist for the metabolism of thiocarbamates in mammals.   One is via sulfoxidation and conjugation with glutathione.  The conjugation product is then cleaved to a cysteine derivative, which is metabolized to a mercapturic acid compound.  The second route is oxidation of the sulfur to a sulfoxide, which is then oxidized to a sulfone, or hydroxylation to compounds that enter the carbon metabolic pool.",

In particular, the 2-chloro-allyl group is responsible for the mutagenicity of these herbicides.  These metabolites likely bind to or disrupt DNA causes base-pair subsitutions. Diallate has been shown to be a carcinogen in mice. Some thiocarbamates (EPTC, Molinate, Pebulate, and Cycloate) share a common mechanism of toxicity, i.e. the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.\n",

The results of mutagenicity studies have shown that thiocarbamates containing dichloroallyl groups are highly mutagenic.  Some thiocarbamates are acetylcholine esterase inhibitors. Acute exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors can cause a cholinergic crisis characterized by severe nausea/vomiting, salivation, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension, collapse, and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  ",

The time-weighted average high and low dietary concentrations of sulfallate were, respectively, 1897 and 949 ppm for male mice, and 1815 and 908 ppm for female mice. After the 78 week period of chemical administration, there was an additional observation period of 12 to 13 weeks for dosed and control mice. There were significant positive associations between increased sulfallate concentration and accelerated mortality in ... female mice. However, adequate numbers of animals in all groups survived sufficiently long to be at risk from late-developing tumors. Statistical analyses of the ... combined alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas and alveolar/ bronchiolar adenomas in male mice, and adenocarcinomas of the mammary gland in female mice revealed a significant positive association between dosage and incidence. These associations were all supported by at least one significant Fisher exact comparison. The incidence of toxic tubular nephropathy observed in ... mice (both sexes)increased with the concentration of the compound administered. This nonneoplastic lesion was not observed in control animals.

Sulfallate was administered in the feed, at either of two concentrations, to groups of 50 male and 50 female rats. Fifty rats of each sex were placed on test as controls for the bioassay. The time-weighted average high and low dietary concentrations of sulfallate were, respectively, 410 and 250 ppm for male rats, 404 and 250 ppm for female rats. After the 78 week period of chemical administration, there was an additional observation period of 25 to 26 weeks for dosed rats, 33 weeks for control rats. There were significant positive associations between increased sulfallate concentration and accelerated mortality in both sexes of rats. However, adequate numbers of animals in all groups survived sufficiently long to be at risk from late developing tumors. Statistical analyses of the incidences of mammary adenocarcinomas in female rats, stomach neoplasms (i.e., combination of papillomas NOS, squamous cell papillomas, and squamous-cell carcinomas) in male rats ... revealed a significant positive association between dosage and incidence. These associations were all supported by at least one significant Fisher exact comparison. The incidence of toxic tubular nephropathy observed in male rats and in mice of both sexes increased with the concentration of the compound administered. This nonneoplastic lesion was not observed in control animals. Under the conditions of this bioassay dietary administration of sulfallate was carcinogenic to Osborne-Mendel rats ... inducing ... tumors of the forestomach in male rats.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.20X10-3 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates sulfallate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase sulfallate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 hours. Sulfallate absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, sulfallate is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Sulfallate may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, sulfallate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9 and 67 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 60 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis may be an important environmental fate process since this compound is hydrolyzed by alkali, with half-lives of 57 days at pH 5 and 30 days at pH 8 being reported. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since sulfallate is no longer produced or used in the US (2012). The general population may have been exposed to sulfallate via ingestion of vegetables grown in fields treated with sulfallate to control certain annual grasses and broadleaf weeds. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase sulfallate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.0X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Sometimes detd. in apple juice Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by a variety of molds, particularly Aspergillus and Penicillium. It is commonly found in rotting apples, and the amount of patulin in apple products is generally viewed as a measure of the quality of the apples used in production. It is not a particularly potent toxin, but a number of studies have shown that it is genotoxic, which has led to some theories that it may be a carcinogen, though animal studies have remained inconclusive. Patulin is also an antibiotic. Several countries have instituted patulin restrictions in apple products. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum concentration of 50 ug/L in apple juice.\n\nPatulin has been shown to exhibit apoptotic and antibiotic functions (A7849, A7850).\n\nPatulin belongs to the family of Pyrans. These are compounds containing a pyran ring, which is a six-member heterocyclic, non-aromatic ring with five carbon atoms, one oxygen atom and two ring double bonds.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Four years earlier, however, a methodologically sophisticated multicentre trial conducted under the aegis of the Medical Research Council was reported, which assessed the effects of the antibiotic patulin on the course of common colds. Philip D'Arcy Hart and Joan Faulkner (later Joan Doll) were the secretary and assistant secretary, respectively, to the committee overseeing the trial, and they clearly recognized the importance of preventing foreknowledge of allocations from those admitting patients to the study. To do this and to 'muddle people up', they and Ruth D'Arcy Hart devised a scheme involving the use of two patulin groups and two placebo groups, allocating patients to one of these four groups using strict rotation. Philip D'Arcy Hart believes that this study has been overshadowed by the celebrated streptomycin trial (for which he was also secretary to the oversight committee) because no beneficial effect of patulin was detected, and because the report of the streptomycin trial referred to the use of random sampling numbers to generate the allocation schedule... /Historical/",

Based on additional information that has become available since the last evaluation, the Committee has reevaluated the PTWI for patulin. As patulin does not accumulate in the body and in the light of the consumption pattern, the PTWI was changed to a PMTDI. Based on a NOEL of 43 \u00b5g/kg bw/day and a safety factor of 100, a PMTDI of 0.4 \u00b5g/kg bw was established. Submission of the results of a long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity study in a rodent species other than the rat is desirable. Maximum intake levels for children and adults are well below the PMTDI. However, apple juice can occasionally be heavily contaminated and continuing efforts are therefore needed to minimize exposure to this mycotoxin by avoiding the use of rotten or mouldy fruit.",

Likewise, no patulin was found in the serum of a volunteer, whose blood was drawn shortly after consumption of a juice containing a maximum tolerable amount of patulin. In further in vitro experiments, the degradation of patulin by reacting it with whole blood was investigated. After addition of 100 ug patulin to 9 mL blood, only 6.1% of the mycotoxin was detected after 2 min. It was concluded, therefore, that even high naturally occurring concentrations of patulin in foods are quickly degraded before reaching other tissues than the gastrointestinal tract.",

Approximately 49% of the administered (14)C radioactivity was recovered from feces and 36% from urine within 7 days after dosing. Most of the excretion of labeled material occurred within the first 24 hours.

About 1-2% of the total radioactivity was recovered as (14)CO2 from expired air. (14)C radioactivity in various tissues and organs was determined throughout the 7 day period; the most significant retention site was the red blood cells.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Exposure of HEK293 cells to concentrations above 5 uM PAT for 30 min induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation; activation of ERK1/2 was also observed after 24 hr incubation with 0.05 uM of PAT. Treatment of human PBMCs for 30 min with 30 uM PAT dramatically increased the phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. Both MEK1/2 inhibitors, U0126 and PD98059, suppressed ERK1/2 activation in either HEK293 or MDCK cells. In HEK293 cells, U0126-mediated inhibition of PAT-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation resulted in a significant decrease in levels of DNA damage, expressed as tail moment values, in the single cell gel electrophoresis assay. Conversely, U0126 did not affect cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase release, and the DNA synthesis rate in PAT-treated cultures. Exposure of HEK293 cells for 90 min to 15 uM PAT elevated the levels of early growth response gene-1 (egr-1) mRNA, but not of c-fos, fosB, and junB mRNAs. These results indicate that in human cells, PAT causes a rapid and persistent activation of ERK1/2 and this signaling pathway plays an important role in mediating PAT-induced DNA damage and egr-1 gene expression.",

The phosphorylated forms of MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4), c-Jun, and ATF-2 were also seen in PAT-treated cultures. The cell death caused by PAT was significantly reduced by the p38 kinase inhibitor, SB203580, but not by the JNK inhibitor, SP600125. Neither p38 kinase nor JNK played a role in the PAT-induced DNA damage. In PAT-treated cells, inactivation of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) by the inhibitor, adenine, markedly suppressed JNK and ERK phosphorylation. Treatment of HEK293 cells with PAT-cysteine adduct, a chemical derivative of PAT, showed no effect on MAPK signaling pathways, cell viability, or DNA integrity. These results indicate that PAT causes rapid activation of p38 kinase and JNK in HEK293 cells, but only the p38 kinase signaling pathway contributes to the PAT-induced cell death. PKR also plays a role in PAT-mediated MAPK activation.",

When cell-permeating fluorescent dyes were used as indicators of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ...  PAT treatment directly increased intracellular oxidative stress in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Lipid peroxidation levels were also significantly increased in HL-60 cells and mouse kidney homogenates treated with PAT. Suppression of CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression in mammalian cells by small interfering RNA resulted in an increase in PAT-mediated membrane damage, while overexpression of human CuZn-SOD or catalase led to a reduction in damage, indicating the involvement of ROS in PAT toxicity. Pretreatment of HEK293 cells with Tiron, a free radical scavenger, reduced the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 elicited by PAT. The ERK1/2 signaling pathway inhibitor, U0126, also significantly decreased the levels of ROS associated with PAT treatment. These findings indicate that PAT treatment results in the ROS production in mammalian cells, and ROS partially contributes to PAT-induced cytotoxicity. Activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway is correlated with PAT-mediated ROS.",

Eleven different strains ... included Penicillium expansum, Penicillium griseofulvum (formerly Penicillium urticae), Penicillium clavigerum, and Penicillium coprobium and a recent Penicillium sp. isolated from an apple. Cultures were grown in duplicate in three different liquid media: potato dextrose, malt extract, and glucose/yeast extract/peptone, both with and without manganese supplementation. Patulin production was compared at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr. Variability in patulin production occurred among the different species, growth media used, and time of incubation. All three of the P. griseofulvum isolates were the highest producers of patulin at 96 hr. For most of the strains, potato dextrose broth supplemented with manganese was optimal for maximum production of patulin. Although P. expansum is frequently cited as the most likely source of patulin in apple juice, certain other Penicillium species are capable of producing more patulin than strains of P. expansum. The apple juice industry should be alert to the possibility that Penicillium species other than P. expansum can be responsible for the occurrence of patulin.",

This widespread enzyme inhibition has a number of effects, including inhibition of aerobic respiration, inhibition of RNA synthesis, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Patulin also affects some aspects of membrane permeability and causes DNA-strand breakage and chromosomal aberrations, likely contributing to it's genotoxicity. Patulin may also cause the development of allergies by inhibiting interferon-gamma production. Mycotoxins are often able to enter the liver and kidney by human organic anion transporters (hOATs) and human organic cation transporters (hOCTs). They can also inhibit uptake of anions and cations by these transporters, interefering with the secretion of endogenous metabolites, drugs, and xenobiotics including themselves. This results in increased cellular accumulation of toxic compounds causing nephro- and hepatotoxicity. (L1943, A2952, A3014)",

A dose range-finding study be performed in order to establish the potential effects of patulin on the immune system and to determine doses that could be used in a full immunotoxicology study. These studies were conducted in female B6C3F1 mice. The animals were exposed to patulin at dose levels of 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, 1.28, and 2.56 mg/kg for 28 days by the oral gavage route. Patulin was prepared weekly in sterile distilled water. ... In this study, no effects were observed with the patulin-exposed animals on either body weight or body weight gain compared to the vehicle control animals exposed to sterile water. Furthermore, no effect was observed on spleen, liver, lungs, thymus or kidney weights. The only organ weight to show a change was absolute brain weight which was increased 16% at the 0.64 mg/kg dose level. The erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC, platelets, and reticulocytes were unaffected by patulin. Leukocyte counts were decreased by 30% at the 1.28 mg/kg dose level and 32% at the 2.56 mg/kg dose level. No effect was observed on the percentage of lymphocytes, neutrophils or eosinophils in the leukocyte differential. However, when lymphocytes were evaluated as absolute numbers, a 33% statistically significant decrease was observed in each of the two highest dose levels. No significant differences were observed in the antibody-forming cell response to the T-dependent antigen sRBC when compared to the vehicle-exposed animals. Furthermore, patulin exposure had no effect on the anti-sRBC serum titer. The effects of patulin on the MLR and NK activity were only evaluated at the highest dose level of 2.56 mg/kg. When compared to the vehicle-exposed animals, no effects were observed on either the MLR or NK cell activity. In conclusion, based on the leukocyte results, the no observable effect level (NOEL) for patulin was 0.64 mg/kg. However, based on the lack of effects on the functional assays, under the experimental conditions of this protocol, patulin was not immunosuppressive at doses levels at or below 2.56 mg/kg.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.8X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates patulin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase patulin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 hour. Particulate-phase patulin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Patulin does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, patulin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Patulin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradatation data were not available. However, Gluconobacter oxydans, isolated from patulin-contaminated apples, was capable of degrading patulin up to 96% to a less-toxic compound, ascladiol. If released into water, patulin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Limited occupational exposure to patulin may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where patulin is present. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to patulin via ingestion of food, and dermal contact with fungus growing on fruit, grains, or vegetables. Patulin is produced by various Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Byssochlamys fungi that may be present in fruits and vegetables. (SRC)",

Patulin disappearance was determined by chemical analysis and bioassay techniques using winter and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). After application of 400 ug of patulin per gram of soil, only 27-69 percent of the patulin was immediately extractable using ethyl acetate. The inability to extract patulin from soil or sand was related to physical and chemical properties. Patulin seemed to be inactivated biologically and nonbiologically in the soil. After 192 hours, patulin was detected in only one of the autoclaved soils treated with 400 ug of patulin(1).",

Vapor-phase patulin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1 hour(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.38X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3) Particulate-phase patulin may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Patulin does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In Germany from 1978-1982 patulin was detected in rotten apple samples and at concentrations of 0.002-0.052 ug/g in apple juice, 0.1-0.3 ug/g in moldy bread, and 0.024 ug/g in pear juice. The highest range of values reported were from Portugal at concentrations of 0.8-100 ug/g in rotten apples. The USSR reported the presence of patulin at concentrations of 0.021-0.031 ug/g in apples, 0.062 ug/g in cherry juice, 0.054 ug/g in commercial apple concentrate, 0.032 ug/g in mandarins, 0.030 ug/g in peach juice, 0.031 ug/g in pear juice, and 0.021-0.04 ug/g in plum juice. In Norway patulin was detected at concentrations of 0.009-0.22 ug/g in commercial apple concentrate and in Sweden 0.005-0.054 ug/g, and Mexico 0.009-0.04 ug/g. In the Poland patulin was detected in moldy beetroots at concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 3.7 ug/g. In Finland patulin was detected at a concentration of 0.02-0.16 ug/g in moldy bread.",

Perphenazine blocks postsynaptic dopamine 2(D2) receptors in the mesolimbic and medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), thereby preventing the excess of dopamine in the brain. This leads to reduction in psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. Perphenazine appears to exert its antiemetic activity by blocking the dopamine and histamine-1 receptor in the CTZ thereby relieving nausea and vomiting in the brain. In addition, perphenazine binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is not clear. Perphenazine is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Phenothiazines generally do not produce substantial cortical depression; however, there is minimal information on the specific effects of phenothiazines at the cortical level. Phenothiazines also act in the basal ganglia, exhibiting extrapyramidal effects. The precise mechanism(s) of action, including antipsychotic action, of phenothiazines has not been determined, but may be principally related to antidopaminergic effects of the drugs. There is evidence to indicate that phenothiazines antagonize dopamine-mediated neurotransmission at the synapses. There is also some evidence that phenothiazines may block postsynaptic dopamine receptor sites. However, it has not been determined whether the antipsychotic effect of the drugs is causally related to their antidopaminergic effects. Phenothiazines also have peripheral and/or central antagonistic activity against alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, histaminic (H1-receptors), and muscarinic receptors. Phenothiazines also have some adrenergic activity, since they block the reuptake of monoamines at the presynaptic neuronal membrane, which tends to enhance neurotransmission. The effects of phenothiazines on the autonomic nervous system are complex and unpredictable because the drugs exhibit varying degrees of alpha-adrenergic blocking, muscarinic blocking, and adrenergic activity. The antipsychotic activity of phenothiazines may be related to any or all of these effects, but it has been suggested that the drugs' effects on dopamine are probably most important. It has also been suggested that effects of phenothiazines on other amines (eg, gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) or peptides (eg, substance P, endorphins) may contribute to their antipsychotic effect. Further study is needed to determine the role of central neuronal receptor antagonism and of effects on biochemical mediators in the antipsychotic action of the phenothiazines and other antipsychotic agents. /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

It is unclear whether perphenazine causes a similar syndrome, but if so, it is rare and far less common than with chlorpromazine. Case series of drug induced liver injury have occasionally listed perphenazine as a cause, but the clinical characteristics of the injury have not been described. Typical phenothiazine induced liver injury usually presents within 1 to 4 weeks of starting therapy, with a cholestatic or mixed pattern of serum enzyme elevations. Immunoallergic manifestations (fever and eosinophilia) are common but usually not prominent, and autoantibodies are rare. Phenothiazine induced jaundice can be severe and prolonged and result in vanishing bile duct syndrome, but is rarely fatal.",

However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

While animal studies have suggested an increased chance of birth defects with high doses of perphenazine, limited information in human pregnancy has not confirmed this.Animal studies using 30 to 300 times the dose given to humans reported an increased chance of birth defects, including cleft palate (opening in the roof of the mouth), retrognathia (the lower jaw is set further back than the upper jaw), and micromelia (one or more limbs are smaller than usual). At lower doses (1.5 and 14 times higher than the dose given to humans), no increased chance of birth defects was noted in animals.Information on the use of perphenazine in human pregnancy is limited. There are case reports of two children who were born with birth defects after being exposed to perphenazine and other drugs during the first trimester. No increased chance of birth defects was reported in 119 people who were pregnant and treated with perphenazine early in pregnancy. A birth registry report on 90 pregnancies with early exposure to perphenazine also did not report an increase in the chance of birth defects.",

Males who take perphenazine might develop a higher level of prolactin, which can cause problems with sexual desire or the ability to have an orgasm. There was 1 report of a male taking perphenazine who experienced an uncontrolled erection that lasted for hours (priapism). Studies have not been done to see if perphenazine use by males could increase the chance of birth defects above the background risk. In general, exposures that fathers or sperm donors have are unlikely to increase risks to a pregnancy.

Gastric lavage (after intubation, if the patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. There is no specific antidote. Standard measures (oxygen, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids) should be used to manage circulatory shock or metabolic acidosis. An open airway and adequate fluid intake should be maintained. Body temperature should be regulated. Hypothermia is expected, but severe hyperthermia may occur and must be treated vigorously. An electrocardiogram should be taken and close monitoring of cardiac function instituted if there is any sign of abnormality. Close monitoring of cardiac function is advisable for not less than five days. Vasopressors such as norepinephrine may be used to treat hypotension, but epinephrine should NOT be used. (L1712)",

There is no specific antidote for phenothiazine intoxication; however, anticholinergic antiparkinsonian drugs may be useful in controlling extrapyramidal reactions associated with phenothiazine overdosage. Following acute ingestion of the drugs, the stomach should be emptied by gastric lavage and consideration also should be given to repeated doses of activated charcoal. If the patient is comatose, having seizures or a dystonic reaction, or lacks the gag reflex, gastric lavage may be performed if an endotracheal tube with cuff inflated is in place to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. Gastric lavage may be useful even several hours after the drug has been ingested, since GI motility may be greatly reduced following overdosage of phenothiazines. Induction of emesis should generally not be attempted, since a phenothiazine-induced dystonic reaction of the head or neck may result in aspiration of vomitus during emesis. Administration of a saline cathartic may be beneficial in enhancing evacuation of the drug from the GI tract, especially following ingestion of extended-release preparations (eg, Spansules). /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

Treatment may include correction of electrolyte abnormalities and acid-base balance, lidocaine, phenytoin, isoproterenol, ventricular pacing, and defibrillation.  Antiarrhythmic agents that can prolong the QT interval (eg, class IA [disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine] or III agents) should be avoided in treating overdosage-associated arrhythmias in which prolongation of QTc is a manifestation. Appropriate therapy (IV fluids and a vasopressor) should be instituted if hypotension occurs; epinephrine, bretylium, or dopamine should not be used. For the management of refractory hypotension, vasopressors such as phenylephrine, levarterenol, or metaraminol may be used. Appropriate therapy should be instituted if excessive sedation occurs; CNS stimulants that may cause seizures should be avoided. If seizures occur, treatment should not include barbiturates because these drugs may potentiate phenothiazine-induced respiratory depression. Hypothermia is common and sometimes difficult to control. In some patients with acute toxicity, exchange transfusions may be useful, but hemodialysis, forced diuresis, hemoperfusion, or manipulation of urine pH is of little value in enhancing elimination of phenothiazines. /Phenothiazine General Statement/",

It is usually evidenced by stupor or coma; children may have convulsive seizures. Signs of arousal may not occur for 48 hours. The primary effects of medical concern are cardiac in origin including tachycardia, prolongation of the QRS or QTc intervals, atrioventricular block, torsade de pointes, ventricular dysrhythmia, hypotension or cardiac arrest, which indicate serious poisoning.

The clinical picture of such patients tends to be \"symptom poor\". A 26-year-old patient is presented who had a 7-year history of treatment for a schizophrenic illness and developed clinical as well as laboratory evidence for SLE. The differential diagnosis included: a) phenothiazine-induced SLE; b) SLE presenting with psychosis as a symptom; and c) SLE and sychosis occurring independently. The patient had a complete medical and neuropsychiatric work-up and was followed for 12 months. This challenging diagnostic problem is discussed. Phenothiazine-induced SLE was the most likely diagnosis. Although the possibility of two diseases occurring independently in the same person did not explain the clinical and laboratory data, it is difficult to rule out this possibility completely. SLE presenting with psychosis as a symptom could be ruled out by the work-up and history.",

In the first experiment, weights 3 days after treatment ended were PER 308 +/- 16 gm and saline controls 329 +/- 25 gm (P less than 0.01). Lengths were also smaller (221 +/- 2.2 mm vs 230 +/- 1.0 mm, P less than 0.05), and the slope of the growth curves for weight and length differed significantly as well. In a second experiment, the liquid diet pair-feeding technique was employed and demonstrated that the growth retardation due to PER could not be accounted for by a decrease in food intake. Pair-fed saline-treated rats who ate 2% less than PER-treated rats had a weight of 264 +/- 6 gm at the end of treatment compared to 236 +/- 9 gm for PER treated (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that PER treatment produces growth retardation and that this is not due simply to decreased food intake. The inhibition of growth hormone secretion produced by PER may be the mechanism of its growth-retarding effect.",

Doses of up to 20 mg perphenazine kg-1 day-1, injected on days 1--7, prolonged gestation but the mothers and young were apparently normal; lower doses were effective only when treatment commenced soon after copulation. The delay in implantation of the ovum caused by perphenazine was corrected and and implantation was brought about immediately, by injection of 0.1 microgram oestradiol together with perphenazine. It is suggested that perphenazine delays and prevents implantation in rats by counteracting oestrogen release from the ovaries.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

These metabolites are excreted in the urine as such or, in the case of the phenol, after the formation of ethereal glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. The nitro group can be replaced by glutathione, leading to the formation of another major metabolite, S-(2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenyl)-Nacetylcysteine, which is also excreted in the urine.",

After seven days 14C residues were low but generally slightly higher in males where the highest concentrations were found in the abdominal fat (0.032 mg/kg, expressed as tecnazene), kidneys (0.016 mg/kg), lungs (0.016), blood (0.014) and heart (0.013 mg/kg). In females, the highest concentration was 0.011 mg/kg in the abdominal fat, blood and ovaries. After seven days the total proportion of the dose present in the tissues was 0.13% and 0.05% in male and female rats respectively. The concentrations of 14C in the tissues appeared to decrease as a function of time on the evidence of autoradiograms at 24 and 48 hours and liquid scintillation counting at 7 days.",

Radioactivity in the female rat was excreted mainly in urine (82%). The male rat, however, excreted approximately equal amounts of radioactivity in urine and feces (the latter via bile). The principal metabolic pathway was conjugation with glutathione (GSH) and concomitant nitro-displacement. The GSH-conjugate and related metabolites were excreted in the bile and ultimately in the urine as the mercapturic acid conjugate. The cysteine conjugate underwent beta-lyase-mediated metabolism to yield a thiol that underwent subsequent methylation to the thioanisole followed by S-oxidation. 4. A novel tetrachloromethyldisulphide metabolite was also formed.",

Retention time was extracted by blending for 5 min in acetone. Samples at 1 ppm were directly injected; samples < 1 ppm were partitioned into hexane followed by passage through an alumina column. Average recoveries varied from 85.6-96.8% with coefficients of variation ranging from 2.18-11.68%. A study conducted to test 23 pesticides for possible interferences with trichloronitrobenzene demonstrated that none of them co-chromatographed. The lower limit of detection was 0.08 ppm.",

Based on the information available in the framework of this evaluation and the proposed conditions of use it was concluded from the evaluation that plant protection products containing tecnazene have not been demonstrated to fulfill the safety requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC. This conclusion has been reached primarily because the evaluation has identified concerns with regard to the safety of this active substance, in particular with regard to mammalian toxicology and effects on non-target organisms. In view of the fact that Hickson and Welch Ltd, the sole remaining notifier of the substance, formally withdrew its support for tecnazene within the EU Peer Review Programme and, therefore, no engagements are made to produce the necessary supplementary data, an inclusion of this active substance in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC cannot be envisaged.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. 1,2,4,5-Tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene is found on List B. Case No: 2630; Pesticide type: Fungicide, antimicrobial; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): 1,2,4,5-Tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products. Thus, we characterize it as \"cancelled.\"",

As a technical impurity of pentachloronitrobenzene, tecnazene may be released to the environment during pentachloronitrobenzene production and use. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.8X10-3 mm Hg at 15 \u00b0C indicates tecnazene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tecnazene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.1 years. If released to soil, tecnazene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5750. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Tecnazene biodegradation was observed in Yolo fine sandy loam soil; after 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 days incubation at 25 \u00b0C, biodegradation values of 8%, 21%, 23%, 26%, and 24% were obtained, respectively, after correction for losses due to volatilization. If released into water, tecnazene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Insufficient data are available to predict tecnazene's biodegradation in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 8 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 33 months if adsorption is considered. BCFs of 1362, 1600 and 2200 in Lake Ontario rainbow trout show bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since tecnazene is no longer produced or used in the US (Spring, 1998). In the past, tecnazene was applied directly to warehoused produce as a dispersible powder or in smoke formulations and exposure to this compound was primarily by dermal and inhalation in the storage facilities where it was applied.

Volatilization of tecnazene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Evaporation of tecnazene from a wet sterilized Yolo fine sandy loam soil after 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 days was 49.5%, 73.7%, 80%, 85%, and 90.5%, respectively(5). Tecnazene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.8X10-3 mm Hg(6). A first order rate constant of 7.2/day, which corresponds to a half-life of 0.1 day, was reported for a biodegradation screening study utilizing an anaerobic sewage sludge inoculum(7); therefore, tecnazene may biodegrade rapidly in soil under anaerobic conditions. Tecnazene biodegradation was also observed in Yolo fine sandy loam soil(5). After 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 days incubation at 25 \u00b0C, biodegradation values of 8%, 21%, 23%, 26%, and 24% were obtained, respectively, after correction for losses due to volatilization(5).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 hours and 8 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column.  The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 33 months if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), BCFs of 1362(7), 1600(8) and 2200(8) show bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Tecnazene's biodegradation in soil of 90.5% in 300 days(9) suggests that biodegradation in water will be slow(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Another 50% loss of tecnazene occured when the peeled potatoes were boiled. Market basket surveys in the USA of about 300 potato samples revealed that 14 samples had detectable residues of tecnazene (ie, 0.0001 mg/kg or more). Trace levels (0.01 mg/kg or less) of tecnazene were found in 15 out of 3,500 samples of USA foodstuffs. Analyses of vegetable products in Belgium and Sweden for tecnazene revealed that most of the lettuce, chicory, mushrooms, carrots, sweet peppers, corn, etc, had levels between 0.001 and 0.01 mg/kg fresh weight.",

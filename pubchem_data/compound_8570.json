ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This has influenced an increase in diseases and syndromes that are more frequent nowadays. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new analytical procedures to evaluate the exposure with the ultimate objective of establishing, in an accurate way, relationships between EDCs and harmful health effects. In the present work, a new method based on a sample treatment by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) for the extraction of six parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, isopropyl-, propyl-, isobutyl and butylparaben), six benzophenones (benzophenone-1, benzophenone-2, benzophenone-3, benzophenone-6, benzophenone-8 and 4-hydroxybenzophenone) and two bisphenols (bisphenol A and bisphenol S) in human urine samples, followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) analysis is proposed. An enzymatic treatment allows determining the total content of the target EDCs. The extraction parameters were accurately optimized using multivariate optimization strategies. Ethylparaben ring-(13)C6 and bisphenol A-d16 were used as surrogates. Found limits of quantification ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 ng mL(-1) and inter-day variability (evaluated as relative standard deviation) ranging from 2.0% to 14.9%. The method was validated using matrix-matched standard calibration followed by a recovery assay with spiked samples. Recovery rates ranged from 94% to 105%. A good linearity, for concentrations up to 300 ng mL(-1) for parabens and 40 ng mL(-1) for benzophenones and bisphenols, respectively, was obtained. The method was satisfactorily applied for the determination of target compounds in human urine samples from 20 randomly selected individuals.",

An enzymatic treatment allows determining the total content of the target EDCs. The extraction parameters were accurately optimized using multivariate optimization strategies. Ethylparaben ring-(13)C6, benzophenone-d10, and bisphenol A-d16 were used as surrogates. Limits of quantification ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 ng mL(-1) and interday variabilities (evaluated as relative standard deviations) from 2.0 to 13.8% were obtained. The method was validated using matrix-matched standard calibration followed by a recovery assay with spiked samples. Recovery rates ranged from 94 to 106%. A good linearity, for concentrations up to 300 ng mL(-1) for parabens and 40 ng mL(-1) for benzophenones and bisphenols, was also obtained. The method was satisfactorily applied for the determination of target compounds in human urine samples from 20 randomly selected individuals.",

Despite their low toxicity, many research papers indicate that BP-UV filters are weak endocrine disruptors (EDCs). There are clear relationships between BP-UV filters exposure and several health disorders such as carcinogenesis and malformations observed in animals. In the present work, a new sample treatment procedure by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) is proposed for the extraction of six BPs, namely benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-2 (BP-2), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-6 (BP-6), benzophenone-8 (BP-8) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP), in human serum samples, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) analysis. The method involves an enzymatic treatment to quantify the total content (free plus conjugated species) of BP-UV filters in serum. The extraction parameters were accurately optimized using multivariate optimization approach. Benzophenone-d10 (BP-d10) was used as surrogate. Limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 0.4 to 0.9 ng mL(-1) and inter-day precision (evaluated as relative standard deviation) ranged from 1.9% to 13.1%. The method was validated using matrix-matched calibration and a recovery assay. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 97% to 106%, and acceptable linearity was obtained up to concentrations of 40 ng mL(-1). The method was applied to the determination of the target compounds in human serum samples from 20 randomly selected anonymous individuals.",

Despite human exposure to BPs through dermal application of products containing sunscreen agents and the increasing evidence that BPs are able to interfere with endocrine systems, few studies have examined the occurrence of BPs in humans. In this work, we propose a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to determine six BPs, namely, benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-2 (BP-2), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), benzophenone-6 (BP-6), benzophenone-8 (BP-8) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (4-OH-BP) in human placental tissue samples. The method involves an extraction step of the analytes from the samples using ethyl acetate, followed by a clean-up step using centrifugation prior to their quantification by LC-MS/MS using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface in the positive mode. Benzophenone-d(10) (BP-d(10)) was used as surrogate. Found detection limits (LOD) ranged from 0.07 to 0.3 ng g(-1) and quantification limits (LOQ) from 0.3 to 1.0 ng g(-1), while inter- and intra-day variability was under 5%. The method was validated using standard addition calibration and a recovery assay. Recovery rates for spiked samples ranged from 98 to 104%. This method was satisfactorily applied for the determination of BPs in 16 placental tissue samples collected from women who live in Granada (Spain).",

Male guinea-pigs were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg benzophenone every day for 15 days and were killed 24 hours after the last injection. Liver sections were examined for histopathological changes. Hepatic glycogen and DNA concentrations were determined by histochemical techniques. Changes in hepatocellular DNA content were used as a marker of mitotic activity. Benzophenone /-6/ induced slight hepatomegaly and nodular cirrhotic lesions. The lobular architecture and hepatic cords were disrupted. The cirrhotic lesions which occurred in the perilobular and centrilobular regions consisted of hepatocellular degeneration, mild fatty changes, and replacement of hepatocytes with connective tissue. Hepatocellular necrosis, seen primarily in the periportal region, also contained areas of regeneration. Proliferation of bile duct epithelial cells was observed. Fibrinous thrombi with significant amounts of leukocyte infiltration were seen in the blood vessels. Macrophages and Kupffer cells containing bile pigments were observed frequently in the sinusoids. Significant depletion of glycogen stores occurred. Biliary epithelial cells showed significantly increased mitotic activity. The authors conclude that benzophenone /-6/ causes unequivocal hepatotoxicity. The increased mitotic activity seen in biliary epithelial cells could indicate incipient hepatocarcinogenesis. Since benzophenone /-6/ is widely used in the perfume industry, long term toxicity studies are needed.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.4X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 2,2-Dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone absorbs UV light at wavelengths of 284 and 340 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. 2,2'-Dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Modified MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 45 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone is produced or used. Limited use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone via dermal contact with consumer products containing 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Nevertheless, little is known about the exposure of Greek populations to these environmental chemicals. In this study, 100 urine samples collected from Athens, Greece, were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for the determination of total concentrations of five derivatives of BADGEs, six parabens and their metabolite (ethyl-protocatechuate), five derivatives of BP-UV filters, TCS, and TCC. Urinary concentrations of BADGEs, parabens, ethyl-protocatechuate, BP-UV filters, TCS and TCC (on a volume basis) ranged 0.3-20.9 (geometric mean: 0.9), 1.6-1010 (24.2), <2-71.0 (2.1), 0.5-1120 (4.4), <0.5-2580 (8.0) and <0.5-1.9 (0.6) ng/mL, respectively. All 19 target chemicals were found in urine, and the highest detection rates were observed for methyl paraben (100%), bisphenol A bis (2,3-dihydroxypropyl) ether (90%), ethyl paraben (87%), 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (78%), propyl paraben (72%), and TCS (71%). Estimated daily intakes (EDIurine), calculated on the basis of the measured urinary concentrations, ranged from 0.023 ug/kg bw/day for sum5BADGEs to 31.4 ug/kg bw/day for sum6Parabens. /Benzophenones/",

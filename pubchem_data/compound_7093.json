The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Clinical signs included depression and nasal discharge at the 0.100 and 0.215 levels; hunched posture, emaciation, and half closed eyes at the 0.215 l ml/kg level. Additional signs observed at 0.464 ml/kg level included wheezing, diarrhea, excessive salivation, hyperactivity, and exceptionally blue eyes. The single high dose rabbit that survived long enough for observation displayed the additional signs of depressed righting and placement reflexes and labored respiration. Signs of dermal irritation were seen in all treatment groups.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

On the basis of these studies, the structures of the complexes have been proposed. All these ternary complexes were screened for their antitumor activity against Dalton's lymphoma in C3H/He mice. It was found that only Mn(II)-5BrU-HISD, Co(II)-5BrU-HISD, Cu(II)-5ClU-HISD, Cu(II)-5BrU-HISD, Zn(II)-5FU-HISD, and Zn(II)-5BrU-HISD complexes have significant antitumor activity with T/C greater than 125% (where T and C represent mean lifespan of treated mice and control mice respectively). The Mn(II)-5FU-HISD, Co(II)-5FU-HISD, Co(II)-5ClU-HISD, Ni(II)-5ClU-HISD, Ni(II)-5BrU-HISD, and Zn(II)-5ClU-HISD complexes are also effective antitumor agents, with T/C greater than 115%. The complexes that showed effective antitumor action in vivo were also found to inhibit 3H-thymidine incorporation (DNA replication) in Dalton's lymphoma cells in vitro.",

This potent oxidant may play a role in host defenses against invading parasites and eosinophil-mediated tissue damage. In this study, /the authors/ explore the possibility that HOBr generated by eosinophil peroxidase might oxidize nucleic acids. When /the authors/ exposed uracil, uridine, or deoxyuridine to reagent HOBr, each reaction mixture yielded a single major oxidation product that comigrated on reversed-phase HPLC with the corresponding authentic brominated pyrimidine. The eosinophil peroxidase-H(2)O(2)-Br(-) system also converted uracil into a single major oxidation product, and the yield was near-quantitative. Mass spectrometry, HPLC, UV--visible spectroscopy, and NMR spectroscopy identified the product as 5-bromouracil. Eosinophil peroxidase required H(2)O(2) and Br(-) to produce 5-bromouracil, implicating HOBr as an intermediate in the reaction. Primary and secondary bromamines also brominated uracil, suggesting that long-lived bromamines also might be physiologically relevant brominating intermediates. Human eosinophils used the eosinophil peroxidase-H(2)O(2)-Br(-) system to oxidize uracil. The product was identified as 5-bromouracil by mass spectrometry, HPLC, and UV--visible spectroscopy. Collectively, these results indicate that HOBr generated by eosinophil peroxidase oxidizes uracil to 5-bromouracil. Thymidine phosphorylase, a pyrimidine salvage enzyme, transforms 5-bromouracil to 5-bromodeoxyridine, a mutagenic analogue of thymidine. These findings raise the possibility that halogenated nucleobases generated by eosinophil peroxidase exert cytotoxic and mutagenic effects at eosinophil-rich sites of inflammation.",

Using a sensitive and specific mass spectrometric method, /the authors/ detected two products of myeloperoxidase, 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil, in neutrophil-rich human inflammatory tissue. Myeloperoxidase is the most likely source of 5-chlorouracil in vivo because halogenated uracil is a specific product of the myeloperoxidase system in vitro. In contrast, previous studies have demonstrated that 5-bromouracil could be generated by either eosinophil peroxidase or myeloperoxidase, which preferentially brominates uracil at plasma concentrations of halide and under moderately acidic conditions. These observations indicate that the myeloperoxidase system promotes nucleobase halogenation in vivo. Because 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil can be incorporated into nuclear DNA, and these thymine analogs are well known mutagens, our observations raise the possibility that halogenation reactions initiated by phagocytes provide one pathway for mutagenesis and cytotoxicity at sites of inflammation.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Such DNA contains single-stranded regions susceptible to endonuclease S1. One of the major sources of the BU-induced lesions appears to be dehalogenation of incorporated 5-bromouracil (BU) residues, with accompanying formation of uracil. The presence of uracil residues in such DNA was demonstrated directly by chromatography of hydrolyzates, and by the susceptibility of such residues to uracil-DNA glycosylase. The number of uracil residues was dependent on the extent of damage in the DNA, and decreased during the DNA repair that accompanied reactivation of bromouracil-inactivated cells. Dehalogenation of incorporated BU presumably results in formation of apyrimidinic sites by uracil-DNA glycosylase, and then single-strand nicks either by AP-endonuclease and/or dehalogenation. The findings are relevant to the mechanism of BU-induced mutagenesis.",

Repair replication of damaged DNA in UV-irradiated bacteria was discovered through the use of 5-bromouracil to density-label newly synthesized DNA. This assay was then used in human cells to validate the phenomenon of unscheduled DNA synthesis as a measure of excision repair and to elucidate the first example of a DNA repair disorder, xeroderma pigmentosum. Features of the TCR pathway (that is defective in Cockayne syndrome (CS)) include the possibility of \"gratuitous TCR\" at transcription pause sites in undamaged DNA. The GGR pathway is shown to be controlled through the SOS stress response in E. coli and through the activated product of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in human cells. These regulatory systems particularly affect the efficiency of repair of the predominant UV-induced photoproduct, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, as well as that of chemical carcinogen adducts, such as benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide. Rodent cells (typically lacking the p53-controlled GGR pathway) and tumor virus infected human cells (in which p53 function is abrogated) are unable to carry out efficient GGR of some lesions. Therefore, caution should be exercised in the interpretation of results from such systems for risk assessment in genetic toxicology. ...",

Enzymatic experiments support this interpretation.  Bromouracil incorporation into DNA proceeds via bromouracil deoxynucleoside triphosphate, which is an effective substitute for thymine deoxynucleoside triphosphate in the replication of DNA.  Results with this and other base analogues have shown that the enzymatic replication of DNA is governed by pairing of a 6-aminopyrimidine to a 6-ketopurine (e.g., cytosine to guanine) and of a 6-ketopyrimidine to a 6-aminopurine (e.g., thymine to adenine). Several questions might be raised about this generalization. First, the accuracy previously achieved in measuring in vitro incorporation disclosed deviations from this rule only when they occurred with a frequency greater than 0.02 per cent. Would a more sensitive technique reveal pairing errors occurring at an even lower frequency? Second, the incorporation of bromouracil into viral or bacterial DNA is associated with an increase in the mutation rate; mutations due to occasional pairing of guanine with tautomeric forms of thymine or bromouracil that resemble cytosine has been suggested by Watson and Crick and Freese.  Matching of bromouracil with guanine instead of with adenine leads, in subsequent replications, to a G-C pair in place of an original A-T. Would the presence of bromouracil in a DNA primer increase the incidence of \"incorporation errors\" when the DNA is enzymatically replicated? Finally, Shapiro and Chargaff  determined the yield of pyrimidine nucleotides and oligonucleotides after acid hydrolysis of bromouracil-substituted Escherichia coli DNA and concluded that the inclusion of bromouracil in DNA led to drastic changes in the over-all arrangement of the bases. It was therefore important to check this conclusion by another method, for example, by analysis of nearest-neighbor base sequences. The availability of a DNA-like polymer made up exclusively of A and T arranged in alternating sequence (dAT polymer)7 made possible the synthesis of the analogous dABU polymer. These polymers are ideal primers for studying the mismatched incorporation of G residues. Using an assay that would have revealed one G residue per 105 A and T nucleotides polymerized, /the authors/  failed to observe G incorporation in dAT-primed reactions. However, with dABU as primer, the incorporation of G was unequivocal; it occurred at frequencies ranging from 1 per 2,000 to 1 per 25,000 nucleotides polymerized. These \"errors\" induced by BU are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude too low in frequency to account for the nucleotide disarrangement reported by Shapiro and Chargaff.  /The authors/ therefore determined the nucleotide sequences in bromouracil-substituted E. coli DNA by the nearest-neighbor analysis; arrangement of nucleotides was indistinguishable from that in the normal sample. Enzymatic replication of a DNA-like polymer which contains only adenine and thymine residues (dAT polymer) revealed no detectable incorporation of guanine residues. The level of sensitivity of these experiments shows the frequency of \"aberrant\" guanine incorporation to be less than one residue per 28,000-580,000 adenine and thymine nucleotides polymerized.  In the replication of an analogous polymer containing bromouracil in place of thymine (dABU polymer), the incorporation of guanine was unequivocal. It occurred at a frequency of one per 2,000 to 25,000 adenine and thymine nucleotides polymerized.  Analysis of the sequential arrangement of the incorporated guanine residues in the synthesized product showed the nearest neighboring base to be bromouracil, guanine, and adenine with frequencies of 41, 42, and 17%, respectively. Current theories /in 1962/ of bromouracil mutagenesis, if applied to the replication of this polymer, would have predicted the incorporation of guanine exclusively next to bromouracil.  The nearest-neighbor nucleotide sequences of normal E. coli DNA were compared with those of bromouracil-substituted E. coli DNA and found to be indistinguishable (-42%). This analysis does not support a contention based on results from acid hydrolysis of DNA that drastic changes in sequence result from substitution of bromouracil in E. coli DNA.",

The radiosensitization properties of BrdUrd result primarily from the electrophilic nature of the bromine, making it a good leaving group and leading to the irreversible formation of the uridine-yl radical (dUrd(.)) or the uridine-yl anion (dUrd(-)) upon addition of an electron. The radiolytic loss of the bromine atom is greatly suppressed in double-stranded compared to single-stranded DNA. Thus /the authors/ propose that the radiosensitization effects of bromouracil in vivo will likely be limited to single-strand regions such as found in transcription bubbles, replication forks, DNA bulges and the loop region of telomeres. /The authors believe that their /results may have profound implications for the clinical use of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) as a radiosensitizer as well as for the development of targeted radiosensitizers.",

Ultimately, 5-bromouracil acts on DNA.  It induces a random DNA point mutation via base substitution. The base pair will change from an A-T to a G-C or from a G-C to an A-T after a number of replication cycles, depending on whether 5-BrU is within the DNA molecule or is an incoming base when it is enolized or ionized.  5-Bromouracil normally pairs with adenine. However, the proportion of 5-bromouracil in the enol tautomer is higher than that of thymine because the bromine atom is more electronegative than is a methyl group on the C-5 atom. Thus, the incorporation of 5-bromouracil is especially likely to cause altered base-pairing in a subsequent round of DNA replication.",

With the nucleic acid base analogue 8-azaadenine (8-AA) a similar effect was confirmed, however, not so pronounced. In the experiments reported here the combined action of BU or BUdR and 8-AA on Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus was investigated. The sensitization effect of BUdR does not increase if 8-AA is present additionally during cultivation. On the contrary, a decrease of sensibilization occurs. This result may be caused by the protective effect of the adenine derivative against UV irradiation, if it is present in the cell, but not incorporated into the DNA.",

One pair of male and female, 8-hours-old, newly hatched, wild type Drosophila melanogaster adults were transferred to a vial containing food supplemented with thymine, 5-bromouracil, uracil, orotic acid, cytosine, or uridine monophosphate at 0.13% of diet. Flies grown without supplement served as controls. Flies were allowed to mate and lay eggs. One week later, the parental flies were removed, eggs were allowed to hatch and after metamorphosis through larval, and pupal stages at 25 degrees C. Newly hatched adults were counted. The number of adult flies that hatched on each supplemented diet compared with the number that hatched on the control diet was used to calculate toxicity. The pyrimidines used in this experiment were ranked as follows: thymine greater than 5-bromouracil greater than uracil greater than orotic acid greater than cytosine greater than uridine monophosphate in decreasing order of toxicity. Correlating pyrimidine structure with toxicity to wild type Drosophila melanogaster, the data suggest that the toxicity was associated with the presence of a methyl or bromide group attached to carbon #5 of the pyrimidine ring. The presence of a ribose-phosphate group at nitrogen #1 on the pyrimidine ring alleviated pyrimidine toxicity.",

Upon substitution with 5-bromouracil, the S/MAR DNA bound more tightly to the nuclear halos. The multi-functional nuclear matrix protein YY1 was also found to bind more strongly to 5-bromouracil-substituted DNA containing its recognition motif. These results are consistent with the above hypothesis.",

The dB containing oligodeoxynucleotide served as a template for in vitro replication by DNA polymerase alpha, DNA polymerase I (Escherichia coli) and AMV reverse transcriptase. The amber 16 revertant assay was used to detect the presence of misincorporated bases in the replication products. For all three DNA polymerases, the presence of dB does not constitute a significant barrier to replication. Errors at the position of dB substitution were found to originate exclusively from dGTP:dB mispairing during in vitro replication thus inducing A-T----G-C transitions. The dGTP:dB mismatches are formed at a 2-4-fold higher frequency as compared to dGTP:T mismatches. Our results indicate that the miscoding potential of dB-substituted DNA templates during replication is only weak at the specific site observed.",

This represents the first structural characterization of a B-form DNA containing brU. The brU.A base pair is Watson-Crick rather than Hoogsteen as seen for the monomers in the crystalline state. From analysis of the NOESY spectra at very short mixing times evidence is presented that substitution of brU for T induces significant conformational changes from that of a normal B DNA. The helix twist between brU4.A11 and G3.C12 is ca. 15 degrees and for both brU4 and G3 the glycosyl torsion angles are significantly changed. The imino proton of the bru.A base pair shows a pH insensitive line with which shows that the pK of brU in this base pair is very much higher than that of the monomer.",

It is moderately soluble in water and readily evaporates into air.

It was used in the past as a soil fumigant, chemical intermediate and industrial solvent and was found in paint strippers, varnishes, and furniture finish removers. Most of these uses were discontinued. Today, almost all of the 1,2-dichloropropane is used as a chemical intermediate to make perchloroethylene and several other related chlorinated chemicals.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For both gavage & inhalation admin, the principal routes of elimination were urine (37-65%) & expired air (18-40%), most of the radioactivity being eliminated within 24 hr, irrespective of the route or sex. Tissues, feces & the cage wash accounted for <11%, about 10% & about 4% of the dose, respectively.",

Sprague-Dawley rats received labeled dichloropropane in ip doses of 100 mg/kg, or by continuous oral dosing at 20 mg/kg per day for four days, while labeled 1-chloro-2-hydroxypropane was administered via ip injections at doses of 100 mg/kg. Urine was collected without fecal contamination for analysis via thin layer chromatography. During in vitro studies, a reaction was carried out in an oxidizing system using 1,2-dichloropropane as the substrate. ... The major urinary metabolite of 1,2-dichloropropane was N-acetyl-S-(hydroxypropyl)cysteine, with 2 minor metabolites, beta-chlorolactate and N-acetyl-S-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)cysteine. Aside from N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine, a known urinary metabolite of 1-chloro-2-hydroxypropane, beta-chloroacetaldehyde and beta-chlorolactate were also identified as urinary 1-chloro-2-hydroxypropane metabolites ... /It was/ concluded that 1,2-dichloropropane oxidation to 1-chloro-2-hydroxypropane, ultimately resulting in the production of N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine, is suggested as the pathway of 1,2-dichloropropane metabolism in rats. The major detoxicating pathway of 1-chloro-2-hydroxypropane is epoxidation to 1,2-epoxypropane, which can either conjugate with glutathione or be hydrolyzed to propane-1,2-diol.",

It is moderately soluble in water and readily evaporates into air. It does not occur naturally in the environment. 1,2-Dichloropropane production in the United States has declined over the past 20 years. It was used in the past as a soil fumigant, chemical intermediate and industrial solvent and was found in paint strippers, varnishes, and furniture finish removers. Most of these uses were discontinued. Today, almost all of the 1,2-dichloropropane is used as a chemical intermediate to make perchloroethylene and several other related chlorinated chemicals.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

When heated, it emits highly toxic fumes of phosgene. 1,2-dichloropropane is used in furniture finish, dry cleaning fluid, and paint remover, gum processing, metal degreasing, oil processing, and as a rubber- and wax-making agent, and a chemical intermediate int he production of tetrachloroethylene and carbon tetrachloride. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Exposure of the general population to 1,2-dichloropropane via air and water is unlikely, except in areas where there is extensive use of 1,2-dichloropropane and \"MIX D/D\" in agriculture. The risk to the general population is negligible. Several cases of acute poisoning have been reported due to accidental or intentional (suicide) over-exposure to 1,2-dichloropropane. Effects have been mainly on the central nervous system, liver, and kidneys. Hemolytic anemia and disseminated intravascular coagulation have also been reported. In one case, delirium progressed to irreversible shock, cardiac failure, and death. Occupational exposures can be via both skin and inhalation. Several cases of dermatitis and skin sensitization have been reported in workers using solvent mixtures containing 1,2-dichloropropane. ANIMAL STUDIES: The acute oral toxicity of 1,2-dichloropropane in experimental animals is low. Short-term, oral toxicity studies of 1,2-dichloropropane in mice and rats showed growth inhibition, clinical toxic signs associated with central nervous system depression, and/or increased mortality at dose levels of 250 mg/kg body weight per day or higher. Studies did not indicate any teratogenic activity of 1,2-dichloropropane at oral dose levels up to 125 mg/kg body weight in the rat and 150 mg/kg body weight in the rabbit. In a carcinogenicity study on mice administered 125 or 250 mg 1,2-dichloropropane/kg body weight by gavage, a dose-related increase in the incidence of liver adenomas was observed. 1,2-Dichloropropane administered orally to rats is rapidly eliminated. Urine is the major route of elimination. Unchanged 1,2-dichloropropane is not found in urine. Three major urinary metabolites have been identified. 1,2-Dichloropropane can also be oxidized to lactate with resultant carbon dioxide or acetyl co-enzyme A production.",

Administer oxygen if there is evidence of altered mental status or dyspnea. Treat hypotension with volume expansion & vasopression. Use lidocaine or beta-blockers for ventricular arrhythmias. Skin: Remove contaminated clothing. Wash affected area with soap & copious amounts or water. Eye: Irrigate the eye for 15-20 min. Obtain a consultation if symptoms persist. Oral: Most of the halogenated solvents ingested in quantities of 1-2 swallows may be partially removed by ipecac-induced emesis if admin within a few hr to a patient who has not lost the gag reflex, is not seizing, is not markedly lethargic, or is not in coma. Observe the patient in the upright position to lessen the possibility of aspiration. Activated charcoal is probably ineffective. Inhalation: Move from the contaminated area. Provide a source of oxygen & prepare for mechanical ventilation. If the patient is unconscious & the pulse is absent, initiate CPR measures. Enhancement of Elimination: Maintain good ventilation. Hemodialysis or hemoperfusion are not likely to be useful because of the high lipophilic properties of these solvents. Antidote: N-acetylcysteine may restore depleted glutathione stores, but no adequate clinical studies are available to validate this possible treatment. Supportive Care: Watch for cardiac dysrhythmias, aspiration pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, & hypoxic encephalopathy. Monitor for arrhythmia for at least 24 hr & for hepatorenal failure for about 3 days. Obtain a chest x-ray, arterial blood gas, EKG, serum creatinine, & hepatic aminotransferase. Check electrolyte imbalance daily. Treat renal failure with dialysis & hepatic failure with fresh frozen plasma, vitamin K, a low-protein diet, neomycin, & lactulose. Watch fluid & electrolyte balance. /Halogenated hydrocarbons/",

Some fumigants are corrosive to the cornea and may cause BLINDNESS. Specialized medical treatment should be obtained promptly following removal of toxicant by copious flushing with clean water. Skin contamination may cause BLISTERING and deep chemical burns. Absorption of some fumigants across the skin may be sufficient to cause systemic poisoning in the absence of fumigant inhalation. For all these reasons, decontamination of eyes and skin must must be IMMEDIATE and THROUGH. 2. REMOVE victims of fumigant inhalation to FRESH AIR immediately. Even though initial symptoms and signs are mild, keep the victim quiet, in a semi-reclining position. Minimum pohysical activity limits the likehood ofpulmonary edema. 3. If victim is not breathing, clear the airway of secretions and RESUSCITATE with positive poressure oxygen apparatus. If this is not available, use chest compression to sustain respiration. If victim is pulseless, employ cardiac resuscitation. 4. If PULMONARY EDEMA is evident, there are several measures avilable to sustain life. Medical judgement must be relied upon, however, in the management of each case. The following procedures are generally recommended: A. Put the victim in a SITTING position with a backrest. B. Use intermittent and/or continuous positive pressure OXYGEN to relieve hypoxemia. ... C. Slowly administer FUROSEMIDE, 40 mg, or SODIUM ETHACRYNATE, 50 mg, to reduce venous load by inducing diuresis. ... D. Morphine in small doses (5-10 mg), slowly, iv to allay anxiety and promote deeper respiratory excursions. E. Administer AMINOPHYLLINE (0.25-0.50 gm) slowly, iv. ... F. Digitalization may be considered, but there is a serious risk of arrhythmias in an anoxic and toxic myocardium. G. TRACHEOSTOMY may be necessary in some cases to facilitate aspiration of large amounts of pulmonary edema fluid. H. Epinephrine, atorpine, and expectorants are generally not helpful, and may complicate treatment. I. Watch for RECURRENT PULMONARY EDEMA, even up to 2 weeks after the initial episode. Limit victim's physical activity for at least 4 weeks. Severe physical weakness usually indicates persistent pulmonary injury. Serial pulmonary function testing may be useful in assessing recovery. 5. Combat SHOCK by placing victim in the Trendelenburg position and administering plasma, whole blood, and/or electrolyte and glucose solutions intravenously, with great care, to avoid pulmonary edema. Central venous pressure should be monitored continously. Vasopressor amines must be given with great caution, because of the irritability of the myocardium. 6. Control CONVULSIONS. Seizures are most likely to occur in poisonings by methyl bromide, hydrogen cyanide, acrylonitrile, phosphine, and carbon disulfide. ... /Fumigant poisoning/",

Case 1, a 28 yr old male accidentally ingested a stain remover containing 1,2-dichloropropane & was admitted to the hospital where blood, kidney, & liver tests were performed. After 2 days, renal failure developed, forced diuresis was carried out, & tests were repeated. Case 2, a 20 yr female, was admitted to the hospital with vomiting, abdominal pain, widespread ecchymoses, hematuria, & metrorrhagia. Symptoms regressed & lab tests were performed. 9 months later, the patient was readmitted with oliguria, epistaxis, hematuria, metrorrhagia, & conjucntival hemorrhages. The patient had been sniffing a stain remover containing 1,2-dichloropropane on both occasions. Lab tests were performed. The patient was given fresh blood & plasma transfusions & underwent hemodiafiltration. Case 3, a 55 yr old female suffering from membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis & on home dialysis, was admitted to the hospital 3 days after cleaning with a solvent containing 1,2-dichloropropane. During the 3 days, she developed anorexia, abdominal pain, & nocturnal sweating. Laboratory tests were performed. Hemodialysis was continued in the hospital. Testing showed that all cases had acute renal & hepatic injury, hemolytic anemia, & disseminated intravascular coagulation. Case 1 died after seven days from septic shock. Case 2 was discharged after 3 wk with complete recovery of renal & function & normal coagulation tests. The hemolytic activity & disseminated intravascular coagulation of Case 3 disappeared after 1 wk. Liver disease improved. Biliary & liver echography did not show pathological findings. /It was/ concluded that wide use of 1,2-dichloropropane in commercial solvents could be a dangerous & unknown source of intoxication.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 53.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-dichloropropane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. In the past, 1,2-dichloropropane was directly released to the environment as a component of the insecticide D-D. Vapor-phase 1,2-dichloropropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 36 days. Photolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process as vapor-phase photolysis under simulated sunlight did not occur after prolonged exposure. If released to soil, 1,2-dichloropropane is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc of 47. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.82X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Dichloropropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation is not expected to be an important environmental fate process in soil or water given a 0% theoretical BOD using the MITI test. If released into water, 1,2-dichloropropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 4 days, respectively. A BCF range of 0.5 to 6.9 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The hydrolytic half-life of 1,2-dichloropropane is expected to be 6 months to several years. Occupational exposure to 1,2-dichloropropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2-dichloropropane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,2-dichloropropane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 1,2-dichloropropane.

Vapor-phase 1,2-dichloropropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 36 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.42X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3).

However, in a bench scale continuous flow activated sludge reactor with an 8 hr retention time, 1,2-dichloropropane was entirely removed by stripping(3). It was reported to be degradation resistant in a 2 week screening test that utilizes a mixed inoculum of soil, surface water and sludge(4). 42% degradation was achieved in 7 days when incubated with sewage seed(6). There was evidence of only slight biodegradation in 20 weeks (as evidenced by 5% of the radioactivity remaining unextracted from a medium loam soil) and it was stable in a sandy loam soil for 12 weeks when incubated in a closed container(7). No volatile degradation products were detected from treated soil(7). 1,2-Dichloropropane, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,2-dichloropropane is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 3 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4 days(SRC). 1,2-Dichloropropane's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 1,2-dichloropropane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 53.3 mm Hg(3). The mean half-life of 1,2-dichloropropane in dissipation studies using soils not previously fumigated with D-D was 52 days(4).

It has been detected in 75 wells at concns ranging up to 1200 ppb in 9 countries(3). Not detected in groundwater underlying the Amphenol metal plating facility in Broadview, IL at a detection limit of 1 ppb(4). Detected in groundwater 83 days after application with 92%, 1,3-dichloropropene(5). Identified in groundwater under a leaky storage tank of a paint factory(6). 1,2-Dichloropropane was not found above the detection limit of 0.16 ug/l in 3 well samples from the Big Creek watershed, Ontario, Canada, an agricultural area with historic use of 1,3-dichloropropane(7). In a survey of untreated ambient groundwater of the US from 1985 to 1995, 1,2-dichloropropane was detected in 0.8% of 406 wells in urban areas at a median concn of 0.2 ug/l and in 0.9% of 2,542 wells in rural areas at a median concn of 0.5 ug/l(8). Atmospheric deposition was shown not to be a source of 1,2-dichloropropane using surficial Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer samples in southern New Jersey(9). 1,2-Dichloropropane was identified not quantified in a survey conducted during 1989 of the groundwater in the vicinity of the Ciba-Geigy Superfund site near Toms River in Ocean County, NJ(10). 32 of 40 piezometers at 13 sites in the Canadian portion of the Abbotsford aquifer showed detectable levels of 1,2-dichlorpropane during testing conducted from July 1991 through June 1994; the avg concn was 2.23 ug/l with a max concn of 7.07 ug/l(11).

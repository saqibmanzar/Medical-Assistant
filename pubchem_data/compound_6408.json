Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

A time- and concentration-dependent increase in the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase and a concentration-dependent loss of total cellular glutathione were observed in cells incubated with 1, 5 and 10 mM HCFC-123 under normoxic or hypoxic (about 4% O2) conditions. Lactate dehydrogenase leakage was completely prevented by pretreating the cell suspension with the free radical trapper N-t-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone. The aspecific cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibitor, metyrapone, totally prevented the lactate dehydrogenase leakage from hepatocytes, while two isoform-specific P450 inhibitors, 4-methylpyrazole and troleandomycin (a P450 2E1 and a P450 3A inhibitor, respectively), provided a partial protection against HCFC-123 cytotoxicity. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with glutathione depletors, such as phorone and diethylmaleate, did not enhance the HCFC-123-dependent lactate dehydrogenase leakage. Two stable metabolites of HCFC-123, 1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane and 1-chloro-2,2-difluoroethene, were detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the head space of the hepatocyte incubations carried out under hypoxic and, although at a lower level, also normoxic conditions, indicating that reductive metabolism of HCFC-123 by hepatocytes had occurred. The results overall indicate that HCFC-123 is cytotoxic to rat hepatocytes under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, due to its bioactivation to reactive metabolites, probably free radicals, and that P450 2E1 and, to a lower extent, P450 3A, are involved in the process.",

Halothane undergoes both oxidative and reductive metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP), respectively causing rare immune-mediated hepatic necrosis and common, mild subclinical hepatic toxicity. Halothane also causes lipid peroxidation in rodents in vitro and in vivo, but in vivo effects in humans are unknown. In vitro investigations have identified a role for human CYPs 2E1 and 2A6 in oxidation and CYPs 2A6 and 3A4 in reduction. The mechanism-based CYP2E1 inhibitor disulfiram diminished human halothane oxidation in vivo. This investigation tested the hypotheses that halothane causes lipid peroxidation in humans in vivo, and that CYP2A6 or CYP3A4 inhibition can diminish halothane metabolism. ... Patients (n = 9 each group) received single doses of the mechanism-based inhibitors troleandomycin (CYP3A4), methoxsalen (CYP2A6) or nothing (controls) before a standard halothane anaesthetic. Reductive halothane metabolites chlorotrifluoroethane and chlorodifluoroethylene in exhaled breath, fluoride in urine, and oxidative metabolites trifluoroacetic acid and bromide in urine were measured for 48 hr postoperatively. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by plasma F2-isoprostane concentrations. ... The halothane dose was similar in all groups. Methoxsalen decreased 0- to 8-hr trifluoroacetic acid (23 +/- 20 micromol vs 116 +/- 78 micromol) and bromide (17 +/- 11 micromol vs 53 +/- 49 micromol) excretion (P < 0.05), but not thereafter. Plasma F2-isoprostanes in controls were increased from 8.5 +/- 4.5 pg/ml to 12.5 +/- 5.0 pg/ml postoperatively (P < 0.05). Neither methoxsalen nor troleandomycin diminished reductive halothane metabolite or F2-isoprostane concentrations. ... These results provide the first evidence for halothane-dependent lipid peroxidation in humans. Methoxsalen effects on halothane oxidation confirm in vitro results and suggest limited CYP2A6 participation in vivo. CYP2A6-mediated, like CYP2E1-mediated human halothane oxidation, can be inhibited in vivo by mechanism-based CYP inhibitors. In contrast, clinical halothane reduction and lipid peroxidation were not amenable to suppression by CYP inhibitors.",

Halothane is reduced anaerobically by cytochrome P450 (P450) to the volatile metabolites 2-chloro-1,1-difluoroethene (CDE) and 2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (CTE). The purpose of this investigation was to identify the human P450 isoform(s) responsible for reductive halothane metabolism. CDE and CTE formation from halothane metabolism by human liver microsomes was determined by GC/MS analysis. Halothane metabolism to CDE and CTE under reductive conditions was completely inhibited by carbon monoxide, which implicates exclusively P450 in this reaction. Eadie-Hofstee plots of both CDE and CTE formation were nonlinear, suggesting multiple P450 isoform involvement. Microsomal CDE and CTE formation were each inhibited 40-50% by P450 2A6-selective inhibitors (coumarin and 8-methoxypsoralen) and 55-60% by P450 3A4-selective inhibitors (ketoconazole and troleandomycin). P450 1A-, 2B6-, 2C9/10-, and 2D6-selective inhibitors (7,8-benzoflavone, furafylline, orphenadrine, sulfaphenazole, and quinidine) had no significant effect on reductive halothane metabolism. Measurement of product formation catalyzed by a panel of cDNA-expressed P450 isoforms revealed that maximal rates of CDE formation occurred with P450 2A6, followed by P450 3A4. P450 3A4 was the most effective catalyst of CTE formation. Among a panel of 11 different human livers, there were significant linear correlations between the rate of CDE formation and both 2A6 activity (r = 0.64, p < 0.04) and 3A4 activity (r = 0.64, p < 0.03). Similarly, there were significant linear correlations between CTE formation and both 2A6 activity (r = 0.55, p < 0.08) and 3A4 activity (r = 0.77, p < 0.005). The P450 2E1 inhibitors 4-methylpyrazole and diethyldithiocarbamate inhibited CDE and CTE formation by 20-45% and 40-50%, respectively; however, cDNA-expressed P450 2E1 did not catalyze significant amounts of CDE or CTE production, and microsomal metabolite formation was not correlated with P450 2E1 activity. This investigation demonstrated that human liver microsomal reductive halothane metabolism is catalyzed predominantly by P450 2A6 and 3A4. This isoform selectivity for anaerobic halothane metabolism contrasts with that for oxidative human halothane metabolism, which is catalyzed predominantly by P450 2E1.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 950 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane will exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.7 years. Stratospheric photolysis of 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane releases chlorine radicals which can participate in ozone-destroying reactions. If released to soil, 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 30. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.27 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2-chloroethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 4 days, respectively. 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2-chloroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis since it lacks hydrolyzable functional groups. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-chloroethane is produced or used.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.27 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 4(SRC), from its water solubility and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 1 hour(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4 days(SRC). 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2-chloroethane's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

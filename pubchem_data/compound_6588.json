When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Three graded doses of TBE (1.17, 13.6, and 123 mg/kg; 1 microCi 14C/rat at each dose) were administered by gavage to three groups of four rats each. Excreta samples were collected at various time intervals up to 96 hr. Following euthanization, 14C activity was measured in the excreta, tissues, and carcass. The fraction of the dose exhaled as volatile metabolites of TBE, excluding 14CO2, was approximately 9-10% higher in rats given the high dose of TBE compared to that in rats given either the low or the medium dose. The fraction excreted in the urine decreased with increasing TBE dosage. 1,2-Dibromoethylene and tribromoethylene were identified as exhaled metabolites at the high dose. Three major urinary metabolites were identified: dibromoacetic acid, glyoxylic acid, and oxalic acid. The results of this study indicate that the metabolism of TBE was linear up to a dose of 13.6 mg/kg, but the contribution of various TBE metabolic pathways was different at a dose of 123 mg/kg.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.02 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 115 days. If released to soil, 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,2,2-Tetrabromoethane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. In a laboratory aerobic biodegradation test, the compound exhibited some biodegradation, suggesting biodegradation in soil may be an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A theoretical BOD of 29% was reported using the Japanese MITI test over a 2 week test period, suggesting that biodegradation may occur in aquatic systems. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 43 days, respectively. A BCF of <8.2 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate under neutral to basic conditions with half-lives of 20 and 2 hrs at pH 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.34X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.02 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 678 mg/l(3). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 43 days, respectively(SRC). However, hydrolysis half-lives of 20 and 2 hours at pH 7 and 8, respectively, have been calculated(5); therefore, under acidic or neutral conditions, hydrolysis will be the dominant removal process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF of <8.2(7), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A theoretical BOD of 29% was reported using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test over a 2 week test period(7), suggesting that biodegradation may occur in aquatic systems(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,1,2,2-tetrabromoethane is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 43 days(SRC). 1,1,2,2-Tetrabromoethane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

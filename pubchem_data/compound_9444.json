It differs from cytosine by the presence of nitrogen in the C5-position, key in its hypomethylating activity. Two main mechanisms of action have been proposed for azacitidine. One of them is the induction of cytotoxicity. As an analogue of cytidine, it is able to incorporate into RNA and DNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and inhibiting protein and DNA synthesis. The other one is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, impairing DNA methylation. Due to its anti-neoplastic activity and its ability to inhibit methylation in replicating DNA, azacytidine has been used mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two types of cancer characterized by the presence of aberrant DNA methylation.  In May 2004, the FDA approved the use of azacitidine administered subcutaneously for the treatment of MDS of all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. In January 2007, the FDA approved the intravenous administration of azacitidine. The use of oral azacitidine for the treatment of AML in patients in complete remission was approved by the FDA in September 2020.",

Azacytidine has been used as an antineoplastic agent. Azacitidine (5-azacytidine) is a chemical analogue of the cytosine nucleoside used in DNA and RNA. Azacitidine is thought to induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms; inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses, resulting in cell death. As azacitidine is a ribonucleoside, it incoporates into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. The incorporation into RNA leads to the dissembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and inhibition of the production of protein. Its incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The use of azacitidine causes anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and pediatric patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It induces antineoplastic activity by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase at low doses and inducing cytotoxicity by incorporating itself into RNA and DNA at high doses.   Covalent binding to DNA methyltransferase results in DNA hypomethylation and prevents DNA synthesis. On the other hand, the incorporation of azacitidine into RNA and DNA leads to cytotoxicity as follows: Following cellular uptake, azacitidine is phosphorylated by uridine-cytidine kinase to form 5-azacytidine monophosphate. Afterwards, pyrimidine monophosphate and diphosphate kinases phosphorylate 5-azacytidine monophosphate to form 5-azacytidine diphosphate and triphosphate, respectively. Azacitidine triphosphate is able to incorporate into RNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and protein synthesis. The reduction of azacytidine diphosphate leads to the formation of 5-aza-deoxycytidine diphosphate, which is then phosphorylated to form 5-azadeoxycitidine triphosphate, a compound able to incorporate into DNA and inhibit DNA synthesis.  As a ribonucleoside, azacitidine incorporates into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. Incorporating into RNA leads to the disassembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and the inhibition of protein production, resulting in cell death. During the S-phase of the cell cycle, azacitidine exhibits the highest toxicity; however, the predominant mechanism of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated.  The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine cause the death of rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells that are no longer responsive to normal growth control mechanisms. Non-proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to azacitidine. It is believed that azacitidine exerts its antineoplastic effects through direct cytotoxicity on abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.",

Several reagents including differentiation-inducing and antineoplastic agents are known to inhibit telomerase activity, although the molecular mechanisms through which they inhibit telomerase activity remain unclear. Demethylating reagents have recently been used as potential antineoplastic drugs for some types of cancers including those of the prostate. In the present study, we examined the effect of the demethylating reagent 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) on telomerase activity using cells of two prostate cancer cell lines, DU-145 and TSU-PR1. 5-aza-CR treatment significantly reduced telomerase activity in TSU-PR1 cells, but not in DU-145 cells, although growth inhibition was observed to a similar extent in both cell lines. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that inhibition of telomerase activity was accompanied by down-regulation of telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT) mRNA expression. Transient expression assays showed that 5-aza-CR repressed the transcriptional activity of the hTERT promoter and that the E-box within the core promoter was responsible for this down-regulation. Western blot analyses revealed that 5-aza-CR reactivated p16 expression and repressed c-Myc expression in TSU-PR1 cells but not in DU-145 cells. Overexpression of p16 in TSU-PR1 cells led to significant repression of c-Myc transcription. These findings suggest that 5-aza-CR inhibits telomerase activity via transcriptional repression of hTERT, in which p16 and c-Myc may play a key role.",

The incorporation of 5-azacytidine (5azaC) into DNA in vitro prevents methylation and thus can alter cellular differentiation pathways. Human bone marrow fibroblasts and MG63 cells treated with 5azaC were used as models of osteogenic progenitors and of a more mature osteoblast phenotype, respectively. The capacity for differentiation of these cells following treatment with glucocorticoids was investigated. 5azaC treatment led to significant expression of the osteoblastic marker alkaline phosphatase in MG63 osteosarcoma cells, which was further augmented by glucocorticoids; however, in human marrow fibroblasts alkaline phosphatase activity was only observed in glucocorticoid-treated cultures. MG63 cells represent a phenotype late in the osteogenic lineage in which demethylation is sufficient to induce alkaline phosphatase activity. Marrow fibroblasts are at an earlier stage of differentiation and require stimulation with glucocorticoids. In contrast, the expression of osteocalcin, an osteoblastic marker, was unaffected by 5azaC treatment, suggesting that regulation of expression of the osteocalcin gene does not involve methylation. These models provide novel approaches to the study of the control of differentiation in the marrow fibroblastic system.",

Azacitidine is thought to induce antineoplastic activity via two mechanisms; inhibition of DNA methyltransferase at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA, and direct cytotoxicity in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and RNA at high doses, resulting in cell death. As azacitidine is a ribonucleoside, it incoporates into RNA to a larger extent than into DNA. The incorporation into RNA leads to the dissembly of polyribosomes, defective methylation and acceptor function of transfer RNA, and inhibition of the production of protein. Its incorporation into DNA leads to a covalent binding with DNA methyltransferases, which prevents DNA synthesis and subsequent cytotoxicity.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, on testicular development during embryonal life in mouse. Ten pregnant mice were administered 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) (ip 2 mg/kg of agent dissolved in 0.1 mg/ml PBS) during 8th (Group 1), 11th (Group 2), 14th (Group 3) and 18th (Group 4) days of pregnancy periods and male siblings of these animals were obtained (experimental groups) whereas the control group animals received no treatment and siblings of this group were also obtained. Testicular tissues from all groups were taken 20 days after birth and examined at the light and electron microscopical levels. All pregnancies were terminated in Group 1 animals, therefore no observations could be done in this group. While Group 2 and 3 siblings showed distinctive kongenital abnormalities such as; anancephaly, growth failure, cleft palate, extremity abnormalities, supernumerary ribs and whirled shaped-tails, no such abnormalities were observed in Group 4 when compared to the control group. Microscopical examination of testicular tissues in groups 2 and 3 demonstrated cellular disintegration of spermatocytes in seminiferous tubules. In addition, cytoplasmic vacuoles and thickening of the basement membrane were also evident in both groups 2 and 3. Apoptotic-like cells were seen especially in group 2 and rarely in group 3. There were no structural alterations in group 4 animals, except a decreased number of spermatocytes in seminiferous tubules when compared to the control group, possibly indicating the completion of embryogenesis in this group. In conclusion, it could be suggested that the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine may trigger an unknown gene reactivation during early embryogenesis possibly affecting the cell and tissue differentiation in developing mammalian embryos.",

In this study, the mutagenic potential of this drug was tested in the G10 and G12 transgenic Chinese hamster cell lines, which have a single bacterial gpt gene integrated into the genome at different sites, with its expression driven by a simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter. We show that the mutation frequencies following a 48-h exposure to different concentrations of 5-AzaC were 10 to 20 times higher than those of any of the other numerous mutagens that have been tested in the G10-G12 system. Moreover, the mutation frequencies were much higher in the G10 cell line than in the G12 cells. Detailed molecular analysis of the 6-thioguanine (6-TG)-resistant variants demonstrated that transgene silencing by de novo DNA methylation and increased chromatin condensation in the SV40 promoter was the major factor responsible for this high level of 6-TG resistance. As would be expected, exposure to 5-AzaC lowered the overall genomic DNA methylation levels, but it unexpectedly caused hypermethylation and increased chromatin condensation of the transgene in both the G10 and G12 cell lines. These results provide the first evidence that 5-AzaC may also induce transgene-specific DNA methylation, a phenomenon that can further be used for the elucidation of the mechanism that controls silencing of foreign DNA.",

We report that this effect can be efficiently prevented by in vivo administration of the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (aza-C). We engineered the U937 human cell line with a retroviral vector consisting of the thymidine kinase suicide gene (tk), which induces sensitivity to ganciclovir (gcv) and through an IRES sequence, the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) as a marker gene. About 90% of the U937 cells expressed the transgene. By injecting the transduced U937 cells in severe combined immunodeficient disease (SCID) mice, we generated a tumor which, during in vivo treatment with aza-C, maintained the high expression of lacZ and tk genes at the baseline values. LacZ-positive cells in the tumour masses after death was weak (1-2%) in the control group, while in mice treated with aza-C it was maintained at 90%. The delay in tumour onset was significantly longer when animals were treated with both aza-C and gcv (P < 0.0001) compared with animals treated with gcv or with aza-C alone. The prevention of silencing phenomena has important implications for gene therapy, because an efficient transduction associated with appropriate drug therapy, might be a powerful strategy for successful application of gene therapy protocols.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

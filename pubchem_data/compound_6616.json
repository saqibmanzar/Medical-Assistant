When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A topical application assay was employed for the contact toxicity study and filter paper impregnation for the fumigant assay. A treated diet was also used to evaluate the repellent activity and a flour disk bioassay for the feeding deterrent action and nutritional index alteration. The essential oil of the leaves contained mainly monoterpenoids, with alpha-phellandrene, 3-carene and camphene predominant, whereas that from the fruits contained mainly alpha-phellandrene, 3-carene and beta-myrcene. The leaf essential oil showed repellent effects, whereas that from the fruit was an attractant. Both oils produced mortality against larvae in topical and fumigant bioassays, but fumigant toxicity was not found against adults. Moreover, both essential oils produced some alterations in nutritional index. These results show that the essential oils from S. areira could be applicable to the management of populations of Tribolium castaneum. /Schinus areira oil/",

The short-term exposure (also called acute exposure) is a short contact with a chemical. It may last a few seconds or a few hours. For example, it might take a few minutes to clean windows with ammonia, use nail polish remover or spray a can of paint. The fumes someone might inhale during these activities are examples of acute exposures.",

It is used in the manufacture of synthetic camphor and as a camphor substitute. Also used as a fragrance, plasticizer for resins and lacquers. Chlorination of camphene produces toxaphene (a persistent organochlorine pesticide of complex composition). HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Camphene is not a sensitizer for human skin. Camphene dissolved in dimethylformamide and water at 1, 10, and 100 ug/mL showed no cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells in monolayer culture. ANIMAL STUDIES: Camphene has low toxicity; the oral LD50 for rats is greater than 5 g/kg. Camphene applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was slightly irritating. It was considered as irritating for the rabbits' eyes, but all symptoms were fully reversible within 7 days. Male rats were used in a 14-day feeding study with daily administration of 0.5% and 1% concentration of camphene in food. 0.5% was the concentration at which no toxic effects were observed after 14 days of exposure. Camphene at 1% concentration in the diet slightly reduced body weight gain. Pregnant rats were administered doses of 250-1000 mg/kg bw camphene from the 6th to 15th day of gestation by oral gavage. No toxic effect observed in treated dams nor in the fetuses at the dose of 250 mg/kg bw for 10 days. Camphene at 1000 mg/kg bw/day caused slight but not significant increase of the resorption rate, and consequently of the implantation loss. No further influence on the prenatal development was detected. Camphene was negative in the Ames test of Salmonella typhimurium TA 98, TA 100 with and without activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Camphene adversely affected larval growth rate and pupal weight of western spruce budworm (Choristoneura occidentalis).",

A combination of camphene and geraniol (CG; 1:1), when pre-administered in rats (10 mg/kg BW), accorded protection against nimesulide hepatotoxicity in vivo, as evident from normalized serum biomarkers and histopathology. mRNA expression and activity of key antioxidant and redox enzymes along with oxidative stress were also normalized due to CG pre-treatment. Downstream effects like decreased mitochondrial swelling, inhibition in release of apoptotic proteins, prevention of mitochondrial depolarization along with reduction in oxidized NAD(P)H and increased mitochondrial electron flow further supported protective action of selected terpenes against nimesulide toxicity. Therefore CG, a combination of natural terpenes prevented nimesulide induced cellular damage and ensuing hepatotoxicity.",

In this study, two terpenoids camphene and geraniol were assessed for their cytoprotective and antioxidant potential using t-BHP stressed rat alveolar macrophages. Effect of these test substances along with a known plant derived antioxidant quercetin was seen on cell viability, some oxidative stress markers as well as on mitochondrial membrane potential. Both the test substances geraniol and camphene increased the cell viability significantly as indicated by MTT assay and LDH release assay, during pre-treatment of test compound. Camphene and geraniol showed 29% (P<0.05) and 45% (P<0.05) increase in SOD activity, 28% and 120% (P<0.001) increase in GSH content and restored the mitochondrial membrane potential during pre-treatment as compared to stressed cells. Camphene and geraniol were found to significantly decrease lipid peroxidation, inhibit NO release (83.84% and 64.61%) and ROS generation in the pre-treated cells as compared to stressed cells. The test compounds also showed significant protection against ROS during post-treatment of the test compounds. ...",

C. indicum flower oil contains 1,8-cineole, germacrene D, camphor, alpha-cadinol, camphene, pinocarvone, beta-caryophyllene, 3-cyclohexen-1-ol, and gamma-curcumene. We evaluated the safety of C. indicum flower oil by conducting acute oral toxicity, bone marrow micronucleus, and bacterial reverse mutation tests. Mortality, clinical signs and gross findings of mice were measured for 15 days after the oral single gavage administration of C. indicum flower oil. There were no mortality and clinical signs of toxicity at 2,000 mg/kg body weight/day of C. indicum flower oil throughout the 15 day period. Micronucleated erythrocyte cell counts for all treated groups were not significantly different between test and control groups. Levels of 15.63~500 ug C. indicum flower oil/plate did not induce mutagenicity in S. typhimurium and E. coli, with or without the introduction of a metabolic activation system. These results indicate that ingesting C. indicum flower oil produces no acute oral toxicity, bone marrow micronucleus, and bacterial reverse mutation. /Chrysanthemum indicum flower oil/",

Camphene is present in the emissions of various plant and tree species. It is found in several fruits and vegetables and in essential oils of various plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates camphene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase camphene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone molecules; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 0.6 days and 1 day, respectively. The atmospheric lifetime of camphene with nitrate radicals is estimated to be 1.7 hours. Camphene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, camphene is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.098 atm-cu m/mole. Camphene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil may attenuate volatilization. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 2% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not a fast environmental fate process in soil and water. Results however from screening studies in which aqueous aerobic systems were prepared with soil and sludge inocula indicate camphene is expected to biodegrade in soils and water. If released into water, camphene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 5 days, respectively. Experimental BCF values ranging from of 432 to 1290 suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to camphene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where camphene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to camphene via inhalation of ambient air, and dermal contact with consumer products containing camphene. The general population may also be exposed to camphene due to its natural emission from plants and presence in some foods. (SRC)",

Volatilization of camphene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.098 atm-cu m/mole(3) based upon its vapor pressure, 2.5 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 4.6 mg/L(5). Camphene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test,2% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not a fast environmental fate process. However, based on screening studies under aerobic conditions in which aqueous landfill leachate containing camphene was incubated with soil and sludge inocula and demonstrated approximately 80% degradation after 14 to 70 hours, camphene may biodegrade in aerobic soils under certain environmental conditions(6,7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant estimated as 0.098 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 2.5 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 4.6 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a BCF range of 432 to 1,290(7) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Based on screening studies under aerobic conditions in which aqueous landfill leachate containing camphene was incubated with soil and sludge inocula and demonstrated approximately 80% degradation after 14 to 70 hours, camphene may biodegrade under certain environmental conditions(8,9).",

Vapor-phase camphene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.6 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(6). Vapor-phase camphene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is calculated to be 1 day(SRC) from its rate constant of 1.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec(3). The atmospheric lifetime of camphene, from experimental calculations, for reaction with hydroxyl, ozone and nitrate radicals is estimated to be 2.6 hours, 18 days and 1.7 hours respectively(4). Camphene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Camphene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Camphene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of camphene with ozone has been estimated as 1.1X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1 day at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). The atmospheric lifetimes of camphene, from experimental calculations, for reaction with hydroxyl, ozone and nitrate radicals is estimated to be 2.6 hours, 18 days and 1.7 hours, respectively(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The emission rates of camphene in forested areas of Baton Rouge, Louisiana from loblolly pine, shortleaf pine, sweet gum, sweet gum (from separate environment), elm, cypress, water hickory, and hackberry were 170, 200, 60, 1300, 20, 140, and 390 ug/kg-foliage/hr, respectively(2). Camphene was identified as a volatile emission from balsam poplar, European larch, Scots Pine, Siberian pine, common juniper, European fir, and silver fir(3,4). Camphene was detected in Scots pine emissions from boreal forests in Finland and Sweden(1). Concentrations were not reported. Balkan pine (Pinus peuce) twig oil and needle oil contain 0.24 percent and 5.52 percent camphene, respectively; samples were collected from 25 to 100 year old tress in the forests of northern Greece during November 1997(6). Camphene was detected in the emissions of 35 out of 63 vegetation species in forests near Atlanta, GA, Rhinelander, WI, and Hayden CO(7). Measured camphene emission rates from these species ranged from 0.1 to 39 ug/hr-gdw with an average rate of 3.1 ug/hr-gdw during the summer of 1993. The mass percentage of camphene in Douglas Fir trees from Socorro, NM and from the nearby Magdalena Mountains during the summer of 1996 was 20 percent(8). In June 1996 camphene was detected in emissions from the remote forest region of Achenkirch/Tyrol, Austria with concentrations of 10 ppbC at the valley station and 6 ppbC at the middle and peak stations(9).",

Camphene was identified but not quantified as an emission from agricultural crops such as pistachio, tomato, carrot, cotton, lemon, orange and walnut, in California's Central Valley during the spring and summer of 1988 and 1989(3). Camphene was detected in the emissions of red maple (Acer rubrum), paper birch (Betula papyrifera), narrowleaf cottonwood (Populus angusstifolia), big-tooth aspen (Populus grandidentata), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and Red oak (Quercus rubra)(4). Camphene was identified in the volatile emissions of Eucalyptus viminalis, Eucalyptus grandis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, and Eucalyptus globulus from southern Australia at rates less than 1.5 nmol/m sq-min(5). In samples taken in May and June 2000, trace amounts of camphene were detected from Eucalyptus salinga grown in a nursery farm in Barba Negra in Brazil cultivated at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada; camphene was not detected in Eucalyptus citriodora and inconsistently detected from samples of Eucalyptus dunni(6).",

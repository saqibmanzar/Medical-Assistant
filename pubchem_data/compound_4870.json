This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Thiazides like polythiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of polythiazide may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle.",

The 'OECD PFAS definition' (no salts) and 'PFAS breakdowns by chemistry' (with salts/mixtures) nodes contain PubChem content matching the OECD PFAS definition of saturated CF2 (Report ENV/CBC/MONO(2021)25). Other nodes explore 'organofluorine compounds'; 'other diverse fluorinated compounds'; 'PFAS and fluorinated compound collections' (including CompTox; NORMAN-SLE; NIST; OntoChem PFAS lists) and 'regulatory PFAS collections' (including Stockholm Convention/EU regulations for PFOS; PFOA; PFHxS; LC-PFCAs). Expand each node for more detailed content.

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The involvement of ADH in the metabolic activation was additionally shown by inhibition experiments with rat liver extracts. Pyrazole, an inhibitor of ADH, competitively inhibited the oxidation of butynediol ... Cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism can not be excluded, because a low increase of aminopyrine demethylase activity was detected.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL).

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Butynediol aerosol at concentrations of 0, 25, 100 and 300 mg/cu m was head-nose exposed on 5 days (6 hours/day) to five Wistar rats of each sex per group ... The 300 mg/ u m concentration was lethal for one animal of each sex during the exposure period (on study day 2 and 3). Clinical findings were confined to this concentration. They consisted in signs of upper respiratory tract irritation (bloody nasal crusts, accelerated respiration) and reduction of general health (piloerection, tremor, squatting posture). Urine samples of males and females exposed to 300 mg/cu m were discoloured from dark yellow to light orange. Body weight development was slightly retarded in the male and female animals. The body weight gain in these animals was significantly reduced compared to the control animals. Clinical pathology showed increased gamma-GT activities, bilirubin and cholesterol levels and decreased urea levels in the serum of both sexes. Increased levels of urobilinogen were detected in the urine of male and female animals. The two animals that died prematurely showed mucosal erosions/ulcers in the glandular stomach (male and female), erosions/ulcers of the forestomach and prominent acinar pattern in the liver, black red discoloration of the jejunal content, and few red brown foci in the adrenal cortex (female). No abnormal gross findings were observed in the remainder animals of the 300 mg/cu m groups. Histopathology of the liver revealed slight to moderate single cell necrosis (four females), liver cell dystrophy (two males and one female) and increased mitotic figures (one female). Inflammation and/or epithelial changes in nasal cavity and/or larynx were present in all animals of the high dose groups. They consisted of hyperaemia, increased/bloody mucus deposition, purulent rhinitis, focal unilateral or bilateral disarrangement of the olfactory epithelium (at levels III and IV of the nasal cavity), or atrophy of olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity (one male only). Mixed cellular inflammation, hyperplasia and focal/diffuse metaplasia of the transitional epithelium of the larynx. Focal disarrangement of the olfactory epithelium occurred at levels III and IV of the nasal cavity; they were characterised by the loss of polar arrangement of the nuclei and by reduced/missing cytoplasma at the apical cell rim. Microscopic findings in the premature died animals were: congestion of liver, nasal cavity, lungs, kidneys, mediastinal lymph nodes, severe liver dystrophy, vacuolar degeneration and dystrophic calcification of the cortico-medullary area in the kidneys, severe lymphocytic necrosis in the thymus, severe lymphocytic depletion in the spleen, erosions/ulceration in the glandular stomach and/or forestomach, increased mucus in the nasal cavity, disarrangement of the olfactory epithelium, inflammation in the epiglottis (larynx level I), and blood resorption in the mediastinal lymph nodes. At 100 mg/cu m butynediol increased urobilinogen levels in urine, inflammation, increased/bloody mucus, focal disarrangement of olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity, and inflammation, hyperplasia and focal/diffuse metaplasia of the laryngeal mucosa were observed. The 25 mg/cu m butynediol concentration caused a higher incidence of increased urobilinogen levels in urine incidence as well as increased/bloody mucus in the nasal cavity, inflammation and metaplasia of the laryngeal mucosa.[European Chemicals Bureau; European Union Risk Assessment Report, BUT-2YNE-1,4-DIOL (CAS No: 110-65-6) (2005).

Its use as a defoliant (not registered for this application in the US) will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.56X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,4-butynediol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,4-butynediol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours. 1,4-Butynediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,4-butynediol is expected to have very high mobility based upon a estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is  not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. 1,4-Butynediol has been shown to biodegrade 90% in 4 days using a sewage sludge; therefore, biodegradation is expected to be important in soil and water. If released into water, 1,4-butynediol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 0.12 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,4-butynediol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,4-butynediol is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1,4-butynediol via dermal contact with products containing 1,4-butynediol. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 0.12(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 1,4-Butynediol has been shown to biodegrade 90% in 4 days using a sewage sludge(6); therefore, biodegradation is expected to be an important environmental fate profcess in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase 1,4-butynediol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 1,4-Butynediol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

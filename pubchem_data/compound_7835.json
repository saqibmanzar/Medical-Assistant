At high levels of exposure, nausea, vomiting, cough, labored breathing, inflammation of the lung, pulmonary edema, and renal lesions may be observed in humans. Chronic (long-term) occupational exposure of humans to epichlorohydrin in air is associated with high levels of respiratory tract illness and hematological effects. Damage to the nasal passages, respiratory tract and kidneys have been observed in rodents exposed to epichlorohydrin by inhalation for acute or chronic duration. An increased incidence of tumors of the nasal cavity has been observed in rats exposed by inhalation. EPA has classified epichlorohydrin as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The tracheal connection of the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract was interrupted. The upper respiratory tract was exposed to propylene-glycol- monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, epichlorohydrin, cmpd which include vapors while the rat spontaneously breathed from a stream of air. Intact rats were exposed nose only to the same compound and the percentages of vapor absorbed were determined for comparison purposes. Attempts were made to correlate the results with the water solubility of the compounds. The data were compared to predictions of two compartment mathematical models. More than 50 to 70% of the epichlorohydrin, vapors passing through the isolated upper respiratory tacts were absorbed. With the exception of styrene and methylene chloride, the percentage of vapors absorbed by the upper respiratory tract approximated that observed in the lower respiratory tract and nose only exposed animals. There was no correlation between absorption in the URT and water solubility. The mathematical models generally predicted the absorption of vapors by the lower respiratory tract and intact animals accurately. The models seriously underestimated absorption of epichlorohydrin, by the upper respiratory tract. /Results indicate/ that blood air partitioning can account for absorption of chemicals by the upper respiratory tract, but only if other metabolic and physiological parameters are considered.",

In a similar study reported here, 1,2-dibromo-3- chloropropane was metabolized to at least 20 radioactive urinary metabolites. N-acetyl-S-(3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)-L-cysteine was only a minor metabolite (4%) of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane. Epichlorohydrin was metabolized in vitro by rat liver microsomes to alpha-chlorohydrin, but 1,2-dibromo-3-chloroproane was not metabolized to epichlorohydrin or alpha-chlorohydrin under similar conditions. Covalent binding of radioactivity to liver microsomal proteins occurred for both substrates, but was less for (14)C-epichlorohydrin than for (14)C-1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane. Addition of 3,3,3-trichloropropylene oxide, an inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase, increased the extent of protein binding of epichlorohydrin, but decreased the amojnt of (14)C-1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane which was bound. The data indicate the epichlorohydrin is not a significant in vivo nor in vitro metabolite of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane in the rat, and is unlikely to be responsible for the toxicity of 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane.",

Glycerine can run to 10-15% of demand while other end uses, such as water and paper treatment resins, and elastomers, account for the remainder.",

Over 90% of global capacity is based on allyl chloride which offers better economics if the site is fully integrated with incineration and co-product hydrochloric acid demand.",

Incubation of erythrocyte lysate from human blood with ECH or d(5)-ECH yielded two reaction products, with CHPV being the major component. The GC-tandem MS method is based on a modified Edman degradation procedure with subsequent O-acetylation. The limits of detection and quantification of this method are 10 and 25pmol/g globin, respectively.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Phosgene, hydrogen chloride and carbon monoxide are liberated while burning. Acids, caustic solutions and halide salts initiate polymerization reactions. The compound is very reactive with metals such as zinc, aluminum, anhydrous metal halides, strong acids and bases along with alcohol containing materials. In the presence of moisture epichlorohydrin is corrosive to steel. Epichlorohydrin has a chloroform like odor. It is soluble in water. Epichlorohydrin is used for the manufacture of glycerine and unmodified epoxyresins. It is also used in the production of elastomers, glycidil ether, cross linked food starch, wet strength resins for the paper industry, water treatment resins, surfactants, ion exchange resins, plasticizers, dyestuffs, pharmaceutical products, emulsifiers, lubricants and adhesives. HUMAN EXPOSURE: On the basis of use patterns and the chemical and physical properties of epichlorohydrin, human exposure is mainly occupational, through vapor inhalation, direct skin contact and a slight exposure resulting from food consumption. Five human volunteers showed significant electroencephalogram changes in the voltage spikes of the alpha rhythm when they were exposed to a vapor of epichlorohydrin. Burning of the eyes and nasal mucosa was reported along with throat irritation. Seven cases of epichlorohydrin spills on the hands, thighs or feet have been described. In two cases epichlorohydrin was mixed with methanol. All spills resulted in protracted chemical burns with a latent period  of between 10 minutes and several hours before the first symptoms appeared.  Redness, swelling,  edema, erosion and ulceration. One case was reported of a 39 year old man who inhaled a few deep breaths of epichlorohydrin vapor occured. Initially only a slight irritation of the eyes and throat was experienced with headache, nausea and vomiting; later chronic asthmatic bronchitis developed. Several biopsies over 2 yr period showed fatty degeneration together with functional disturbances of the liver. ANIMAL/FISH/PLANT/BACTERIAL/ PROTOZOAN/ STUDIES: When the tails of mice were immersed in undiluted epichlorohydrin for 15-60 minutes, most died exhibiting severe systemic poisoning. Within 7 days, 50% of the rabbits died after the application of epichlorohydrin on an occluded patch of shaved skin for 24 hr. Eight hours after oral administration of epichlorohydrin to rats less than 10% of the dose was recovered in the gastrointestinal tract; peak tissue levels occurred approximately 2 hr after dosing in the males and 4 hr in the females. Almost all orally ingested epichlorohydrin was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of rats. After absorption by rats, epichlorohydrin was distributed widely through out many tissues. Concentrations of epichlorohydrin found in the blood, 2-4 hr after oral ingestion were subsequently exceeded by a factor of 2 or more in the stomach and intestines, kidneys, prostate and lacrimal glands and the liver. Directly after inhalation, such levels occurred mainly in the epithelium of the nasal turbinates, lacrimal glands, kidneys, liver and large intestine. The following metabolites have been identified in the urine of rats: 2,3-dihydroxypropyl-S-cysteine and its mercapturic acid, beta-chloroacetic acid, oxalic acid and 1,3-bis-mercaptylpropanol-2-ol. Epichlorohydrin is an alkylating agent and has been found to react with nucleic acid bases deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine in vitro. After acute intoxication through oral, inhalation or skin exposure death was due to respiratory failure. At lethal doses, histopathological changes were found in the lungs, liver, kidneys, adrenals and thyroid gland of mice and rats. Acute respiratory irritation with hemorrhage and severe edema occurred in rats after inhalation or oral dosing. Rats injected once sc with epichlorohydrin showed nephrotoxic degeneration of the epithelium of the proximal tubules with ischemic cortex necrosis in the first days after exposure. This phase was accompanied by anuria or oliguria then death. Renal insufficiency was noted along with functional disturbances such as proteinuria, increased sodium ion concentration in the urine and an increased potassium ion concentration in the serum. The activity of the enzymes cytochrome c-oxidase, catalase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase and to a lesser extent alkaline phosphatase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase was inhibited in renal tissue, while catalase activity was increased in the urine. Regeneration of the kidneys in surviving rats started 5 days after exposure. Slight histological liver changes were also found in mice after 2 hr inhalation exposure to epichlorohydrin which included increased pentobarbital sleeping time in mice and a dose related decrease in histaminases activity in rats. Application of 80% solution  epichlorohydrin in cottonseed oil caused corneal damage in the rabbit eye. A 20% solution induced definitive conjunctival and palpebral irritation with edema. Severe  skin irritation was seen in a 24 hr occluded patch test on the shaved back of rabbits using a 5% solution of epichlorohydrin in cotton seed oil. Groups of 20 male Wistar rats received epichlorohydrin in water by stomach tube five times a week for 12 weeks. Reduced body weight was noted. From the first week onwards, time and dose related increase was observed in the changes in the basal cell layer of the forestomach such as thickening of the stomach wall, hemorrhaging, hyperplasia and increased number of mitotic figures and nuclei. After 12 weeks some of the rats had papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Each group of 30 female ICR/HCA Swiss mice received an ip dose of epichlorohydrin in tricaprylin once a week for up to 450 rats. A group of 100 mice did not receive any treatment and a group of 50 mice received the vehicle only. Papillary tumors were observed in the lungs of 11 exposed mice and 10 vehicle control mice. A group of 40 C3H mice was painted three times a week with a brushful of undiluted epichlorohydrin on the clipped midline of the back for up to 25 months. At month 17, 30 mice were alive and at moth 24 only 1 . No tumors were found. Female rats received orally epichlorohydrin in cotton seed oil between the 6th and 15th day of pregnancy. Higher dose levels were toxic to the dams, no embryotoxic, fetotoxic or teratogenic effects were observed. Similar negative results were obtained when female rats and rabbits inhaled vapors of epichlorohydrin 7 hr/day between the 6th and 15th or the 18th day of pregnancy. Epichlorohydrin is acutely toxic to blue and green algae, bacteria, crustacea  and fish.",

Chromosomal aberrations were noted to consist of overt breakage and rearangements of chromosomes visualized in the metaphase plate. Chromosomal aberrations were most sensitive to agents that directly break the DNA duplex, such as ionizing radiation and radiomimetic chemicals. Sister chromatid exchanges involved breakage of double stranded DNA in both chromatids followed by an exchange of whole DNA duplexes. Usually, less than 7 to 8% values of chromosomally damaged lymphocytes have no significance as such to the health of the individual. Exposure to carcinogenic genotoxic chemicals and induced cytogenetic damage correlated with cancer risk. In a Finnish cohort, a statistically significant positive trend for cancer risk and chromosome aberrations, whereas no such trend was noted for sister chromatid exchanges. Increased frequencies of chromosomal damage serves as an indicator of exposure to genotoxic agents and signals the potential of cancer risk at the group level. Cytogenetic surveillance of people exposed to ionizing radiation has been carried out for many years. Experience has also been gained with agents such as benzene, ethylene oxide, vinyl chloride, sytrene, epichlorohydrin, and some alkylating anticancer drugs. The available cytogenetic test systems are still too insensitive and tedious for use as a routine surveillance procedure.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 16.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates epichlorohydrin will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase epichlorohydrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 36 days. If released to soil, epichlorohydrin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 40. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Epichlorohydrin may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Epichlorohydrin is expected to undergo hydrolysis in moist soil surfaces. Limited data suggest that epichlorohydrin may undergo biodegradation in acclimated soil and surface waters. If released into water, epichlorohydrin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 hours and 12 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process based upon hydrolysis half-lives of 8.2 days and 5.3 days in distilled water and simulated seawater, respectively. Occupational exposure to epichlorohydrin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where epichlorohydrin is produced or used. Use data suggest that the general population may be exposed to epichlorohydrin via inhalation and dermal contact with products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization of epichlorohydrin from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from a vapor pressure of 16.4 mm Hg(4) and water solubility of 65,900 mg/L(5). The potential for volatilization of epichlorohydrin from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon the vapor pressure(4). Epichlorohydrin may undergo hydrolysis in moist soil surfaces based on a hydrolysis half-life of 8.2 days in distilled water(6). Epichlorohydrin achieved 3% of the theoretical BOD in a sewage sludge over a 5 day incubation period, but achieved 14% of the theoretical BOD following acclimation(7), suggesting that biodegradation in acclimated soils may be important(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure of 16.4 mm Hg(4) and water solubility of 65,900 mg/L(5). Using this estimated Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 19 hours and 12 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The hydrolysis half-life of epichlorohydrin is 8.2 days in distilled water and 5.3 days in simulated seawater(8). Epichlorohydrin achieved 3% of the theoretical BOD in a sewage sludge over a 5 day incubation period, but achieved 14% of the theoretical BOD following acclimation(9); thus biodegradation in acclimated water may be important(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 36 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Epichlorohydrin hydrolyzes in distilled water to yield 1-chloro-2,3-propanediol, with a half-life of 8.2 days(2). Acid catalysis contributes less than 10% to the rate of hydrolysis and base catalysis is not detectable at pH<10(2). The hydrolysis half-life of epichlorohydrin in 3% sodium chloride (simulated seawater) is 5.3 days(2). The reported hydrolysis half-life of epichlorohydrin in acidic waters (pH = 2.5) was reported as 3.3 days and in alkaline waters (pH = 12) 2.6 days(3). Anions such as chloride attack the epoxide ring producing 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol(4). When irradiated in the presence of 5 ppm nitric oxide to simulate photochemical smog conditions, the half-life of epichlorohydrin was 16 hours(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

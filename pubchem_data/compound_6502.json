PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.7X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 30 hours. Particulate-phase 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1,1,1-Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of less than 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1,1-Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane is unlikely to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. 1,1,1-Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane, present at 100 mg/L, reached 4 percent of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane is produced or used.

Vapor-phase 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 30 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). 1,1,1-Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

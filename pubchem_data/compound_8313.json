                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

FOR THIS REASON OBSERVE THE FOLLOWING PRECAUTIONS: (1) IF THE VICTIM IF UNCONSCIOUS OR OBTUNDED & FACILITIES ARE AT HAND, INSERT AN ENDOTRACHEAL TUBE (CUFFED, IF AVAILABLE) PRIOR TO GASTRIC INTUBATION. (2) KEEP VICTIM'S HEAD BELOW LEVEL OF STOMACH DURING INTUBATION & LAVAGE /PRC: TAP WATER IN CHILDREN, ISOTONIC SALINE IN ADULTS/ (TRENDELENBURG, OR LEFT LATERAL DECUBITUS, WITH HEAD OF TABLE TIPPED DOWNWARD). KEEP VICTIM'S HEAD TURNED TO THE LEFT. (3) ASPIRATE PHARYNX AS REGULARLY AS POSSIBLE TO REMOVE GAGGED OR VOMITED STOMACH CONTENTS. /PESTICIDES OF LOW OR MODERATE TOXICITY/",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

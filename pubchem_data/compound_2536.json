It has a role as an anticoronaviral agent, a serine protease inhibitor, an antifibrinolytic drug, an anti-inflammatory agent, an antiviral agent, an antihypertensive agent and an antineoplastic agent. It is a tertiary carboxamide, a carboxylic ester, a diester, a member of guanidines and a benzoate ester. It is functionally related to a 4-guanidinobenzoic acid. It is a conjugate base of a camostat(1+).",

Upon oral administration, camostat and its metabolite 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxyl)phenyl acetic acid (FOY 251) inhibit the activities of a variety of proteases, including trypsin, kallikrein, thrombin and plasmin, and C1r- and C1 esterases. Although the mechanism of action of camostat is not fully understood, trypsinogen activation in the pancreas is known to be a trigger reaction in the development of pancreatitis. Camostat blocks the activation of trypsinogen to trypsin and the inflammatory cascade that follows. Camostat may also suppress the expression of the cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1b), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), along with alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). This reduces inflammation and fibrosis of the pancreas. In addition, camostat may inhibit the activity of transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a host cell serine protease that mediates viral cell entry for influenza virus and coronavirus, thereby inhibiting viral infection and replication.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

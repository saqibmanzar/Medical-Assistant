Carbamate pesticides are derived from carbamic acid and kill insects in a similar fashion as organophosphate insecticides. They are widely used in homes, gardens and agriculture. The first carbamate, carbaryl, was introduced in 1956 and more of it has been used throughout the world than all other carbamates combined. Because of carbaryl's relatively low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and broad control spectrum, it has had wide use in lawn and garden settings. Most of the carbamates are extremely toxic to Hymenoptera, and precautions must be taken to avoid exposure to foraging bees or parasitic wasps. Some of the carbamates are translocated within plants, making them an effective systemic treatment. (L795)",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Carbamates form unstable complexes with chlolinesterases by carbamoylation of the active sites of the enzymes.  This inhibition is reversible. A cholinesterase inhibitor suppresses the action of acetylcholine esterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholine esterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses.  Headache, salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are often prominent at higher levels of exposure. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Chronically high (>10 years) exposure leads to neuropsychological consequences including disturbances in perception and visuo-motor processing (A15321).",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

When given alone at a dose of 25 mg/kg, SKF525-A did not alter behavioral response or brain cholinesterase levels. When it was given 30 min prior to eserine, a 4- to 8-fold increase in the number of shocks normally taken after eserine alone was observed with a similar enhancement of inhibitory effects of cholinesterase. Similar schedules with /(Phenol, 3-(1-methylethyl)-methylcarbamate)/ or carbaryl revealed about a 2-fold enhancement of the behavioral effects of these agents. Concomitant potentiation of anticholinesterase effects was obtained with /(Phenol, 3-(1-methylethyl)-methylcarbamate)/  but not with carbaryl.",

Animals were given from 1 to 100 milligrams per kilograms of Zectran (315184), o-isopropoxyphenyl-methylcarbamate, m-isopropylphenyl-methylcarbamate,  /(Phenol, 3-(1-methylethyl)-methylcarbamate)/ 2,3-dihydro-2-methylfuran-7-yl-methylcarbamate, 2-methyl-2-methyl-thiopropionaldehyde-O-(methylcarbamoyl)-oxime, ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylacrylate-diethyl-phosphate, and O,O-diethyl-S-(methylcarbamoylethyl)-phosphorodithioate by stomach intubation. Therapeutic doses of atropine or TEAB were given at the same time or 5 to 10 minutes after the insecticide. ... The onset of signs of poisoning after dosing with carbamates was very rapid. Both atropine and TEAB were effective in controlling the effects of the carbamates. Atropine tended to control symptoms and produce recovery faster than TEAB. TEAB was as effective as atropine against 2,3-dihydro-2-methylfuran-7-yl-methylcarbamate only. Atropine was greatly superior to TEAB as a therapeutic agent following dosing with organophosphorus compounds. TEAB had little or no effect.",

Pay careful attention to respiratory weakness; sudden respiratory arrest may occur. This is often preceded by increasing weakness of neck flexion muscles. If intubation is required, note the potential for interaction between neuromuscular blockers and cholinesterase inhibitors. Administer supplemental oxygen. Treat hydrocarbon pneumonitis, seizures, and coma if they occur. Observe asymptomatic patients for at least 8-12 hours to rule out delayed onset symptoms especially after extensive skin exposure or ingestion of a highly fat-soluble agent. Specific treatment includes the antimuscarinic agent atropine and the enzyme reactivator pralidoxime. ... Do not induce vomiting because of the risk of abrupt onset of toxicity. ... Administer activated charcoal (cathartics are not necessary if the patient already has diarrhea ). Consider inserting a small flexible gastric tube to aspirate liquid gastric contents, if this procedure can be carried out safely and within 1-2 hours of ingestion. The inadvertent introduction of hydrocarbon solvents into the lungs through overly aggressive gastric lavage may kill the patient.) /Organophosphorus and Carbamate insecticides/",

None of these eye signs,  however, is dependable for diagnosis. Mydriasis may be seen secondary to sympathoadrenal discharge.  5. Loss of muscle coordination, slurring of speech, fasciculations and twitching of muscles. 6.  Difficulty in breathing, excessive secretions of saliva and of respiratory tract mucus, oronasal  frothing, cyanosis, pulmonary rales and rhonchi and hypertension (presumably due to asphyxia). 7.

(b) Nicotinic manifestations - fasciculation of fine muscles (in severe cases, diaphragm and respiratory muscles also involved); and tachycardia. (c) Central nervous system manifestations- headache, dizziness, anxiety, mental confusion, convulsions, and coma; and depression of respiratory center. All these signs and symptoms can occur in different combinations and can vary in onset and sequence, depending on the chemical, dose, and route of exposure. The duration of symptoms is usually shorter than that observed in organophosphorus poisoning. Mild poisoning might include muscarinic and nicotinic signs only. Severe cases always show central nervous system involvement; the clinical picture is dominated by the respiratory failure sometimes leading to pulmonary edema due to the combination of the above mentioned symptoms. /Carbamate pesticides/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.0044 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours. 3-Isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm needed to make direct photolysis an important environmental degradation process. While data specific to 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate are lacking, numerous genera of carbamate-hydrolyzing bacteria have been identified, including Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Nocardia, Achromobacter, Flavobacterium, Streptomyces, Alcaligenes, Azospirillum, Micrococcus, and Rhodococcus. If released to soil, 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 640. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. 3-Isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 21 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 3.0 L/mole-sec was estimated, corresponding to half-lives of 27 and 2.7 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate since it is no longer produced or used in the US (April, 2005). In the past, 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate was applied directly to the environment as an insecticide and exposure to this compound was primarily by inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate was produced or used.

A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 3.0 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(7); this corresponds to half-lives of 27 days and 2.7 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(7). While data specific to 3-isopropylphenyl methyl carbamate are lacking(SRC), numerous genera of carbamate-hydrolyzing bacteria have been identified, including Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Nocardia, Achromobacter, Flavobacterium, Streptomyces, Alcaligenes, Azospirillum, Micrococcus, and Rhodococcus(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

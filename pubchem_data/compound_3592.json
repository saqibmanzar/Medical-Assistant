The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Heroin use by a nursing mother is generally considered to be a contraindication to breastfeeding.

She continued to use the snuff and became dependent. Her breastfed (extent not stated, but probably nearly exclusive) infant slept excessively, but when awake would curl up with abdominal cramps and cry continuously until breastfed. When the mother was deprived of the drug, the infant would yawn, sneeze, sweat, cry and have cramps in addition to occasional diarrhea. The mother was arrested and the infant was examined by the prison physician. Upon examination, the infant was \"pale and flabby looking.\" with almost colorless lips and pinpoint pupils that did not react to light. The infant slept for most of the day then awoke with sweating and cramps. The infant was treated with camphorated tincture of opium (paregoric) and tincture of nux vomica (containing strychnine) three times daily. After 4 days of therapy, the infant reportedly appeared more cheerful and had no more cramps.",

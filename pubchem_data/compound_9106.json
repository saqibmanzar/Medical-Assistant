PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil. They can occur in the air, either attached to dust particles or as solids in soil or sediment. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

The variability of the PAH concentrations determined between different tires was large; a factor of 22.6 between the lowest and the highest. The relative abundance of the analytes was quite similar regardless of tire. Almost all (92.3%) of the total extractable PAH content was attributed to five PAHs: benzo[ghi]perylene, coronene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo[e]pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene. The difference in the measured PAH content between summer and winter tires varied substantially across manufacturers, making estimates of total vehicle fleet emissions very uncertain. However, when comparing different types of tires from the same manufacturer they had significantly (p = 0.05) different PAH content. Previously, there have been no data available for carcinogenic dibenzopyrene isomers in automobile tires. In this study, the four dibenzopyrene isomers dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene constituted <2% of the sum of the 15 analyzed HMW PAHs. These findings show that automobile tires may be a potential previously unknown source of carcinogenic dibenzopyrenes to the environment.",

In this article, we combine solid-phase nano-extraction (SPNE) and 4.2 K laser-excited time resolved Shpol'skii spectroscopy (LETRSS) into a valuable alternative for the water analysis of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene and naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene. In comparison to the original SPNE procedure, the present method improves PAH recoveries and reduces extraction time from 30 to 20 min per sample. Quantitative release of HMW-PAH into the Shpol'skii matrix (n-octane) is best accomplished with a mixture of 48 uL of methanol and 2 uL of 1-pentanethiol. Their migration into the 50 uL layer of n-octane provides highly resolved spectra with distinct fluorescence lifetimes for unambiguous isomer determination. Complete analysis takes less than 30 min per sample and consumes only 100 micro-liters of organic solvents. 500 uL of water are sufficient to obtain limits of detection ranging from 16 ng/L (dibenzo[a,l]pyrene) to 55 ng/L (dibenzo[a,i]pyrene), relative standard deviations better than 3% and analytical recoveries above 90%. Although a straightforward comparison to chromatographic methods is not possible because of the lack of analytical figures of merit on HMW-PAH, the excellent precision of measurements, limits of detection and overall recoveries makes SPNE-LETRSS an attractive approach to water analysis of HMW-PAH.",

The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated with two isomers of molecular weight 302 with identical mass fragmentation patterns, namely dibenzo[a,i]pyrene and naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene. Qualitative and quantitative analysis is carried out via laser-excited time-resolved Shpol'skii spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. Unambiguous identification of co-eluted isomers is based on their characteristic 4.2 K line-narrowed spectra in n-octane as well as their fluorescence lifetimes. Pre-concentration of HPLC fractions prior to spectroscopic analysis is performed with the aid of gold nanoparticles via an environmentally friendly procedure. In addition to the two co-eluted isomers, the analytical figures of merit of the entire procedure were evaluated with dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene and dibenzo[a,e]pyrene. The analytical recoveries from drinking water samples varied between 98.2 +/- 5.5 (dibenzo[a,l]pyrene) and 102.7 +/- 3.2% (dibenzo[a,i]pyrene). The limits of detection ranged from 51.1 ng/L (naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene) to 154 ng/L (dibenzo[a,e]pyrene). The excellent analytical figures of merit associated to its HPLC compatibility makes this approach an attractive alternative for the analysis of co-eluted isomers with identical mass spectra.",

Extraction of SRM 2975 using toluene/methanol (9:1, v/v) at maximum instrumental settings (200 \u00b0C, 20.7 MPa, and five extraction cycles) with 30-min extraction times resulted in the following elevations of the measured concentration when compared with the certified and reference concentrations reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): benzo[b]fluoranthene, 46%; benzo[k]fluoranthene, 137%; benzo[e]pyrene, 103%; benzo[a]pyrene, 1,570%; perylene, 37%; indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, 41%; benzo[ghi]perylene, 163%; and coronene, 361%. The concentrations of the following PAHs were comparable to the reference values assigned by NIST: indeno[1,2,3-cd]fluoranthene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, and picene. The measured concentration of dibenzo[a,e]-pyrene was lower than the information value reported by the NIST. The measured concentrations of other highly carcinogenic PAHs (dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene) in SRM 2975 are also reported. Comparison of measurements using the optimized ASE method and using similar conditions to those applied by the NIST for the assignment of PAH concentrations in SRM 2975 indicated that the higher values obtained in the present study were associated with more complete extraction of PAHs from the diesel particulate material. Re-extraction of the particulate samples demonstrated that the deuterated internal standards were more readily recovered than the native PAHs, which may explain the lower values reported by the NIST. The analytical results obtained in the study demonstrated that the efficient extraction of PAHs from SRM 2975 is a critical requirement for the accurate determination of PAHs with high molecular masses in this standard reference material and that the optimization of extraction conditions is essential to avoid underestimation of the PAH concentrations. ...",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The variability of the PAH concentrations determined between different tires was large; a factor of 22.6 between the lowest and the highest. The relative abundance of the analytes was quite similar regardless of tire. Almost all (92.3%) of the total extractable PAH content was attributed to five PAHs: benzo[ghi]perylene, coronene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo[e]pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene. The difference in the measured PAH content between summer and winter tires varied substantially across manufacturers, making estimates of total vehicle fleet emissions very uncertain. However, when comparing different types of tires from the same manufacturer they had significantly (p = 0.05) different PAH content. Previously, there have been no data available for carcinogenic dibenzopyrene isomers in automobile tires. In this study, the four dibenzopyrene isomers dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene constituted <2% of the sum of the 15 analyzed HMW PAHs. These findings show that automobile tires may be a potential previously unknown source of carcinogenic dibenzopyrenes to the environment.[Sadiktsis I et al; Environ Sci Technol 46 (6): 3326-34 (2012)]",

It is used as an experimental carcinogen. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: DB(a,i)P is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. DB(a,i)P was mutagenic in the Ames test, in the presence of hepatic post-mitochondrial preparations isolated from man. ANIMAL STUDIES Groups of 20 female mice received 10 dermal applications of DB(a,i)P (total doses, 100 ug and 500 ug). Ten days after initiation had been completed, all animals received applications of 2.5 ug 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 20 weeks. Mice treated with 100 ug DB(a,i)P had a 40% skin tumor incidence (average of 0.5 skin tumors/mouse), whereas the group treated with 500 ug DB(a,i)P had an 85% skin tumor incidence (average of 5.8 skin tumors/mouse). A group of 20 female rats received intramamillary injection of 4 umol (1.2 mg)/gland DB(a,i)P and another was untreated. At the end of the study, 18/19 rats in the DB(a,i)P-treated group had developed fibrosarcomas (2.4 tumors/tumor-bearing rat), 11/19 rats had mammary adenocarcinomas (1.4 tumors/tumor-bearing rat) and 1/19 had mammary adenofibromas (two tumors). In contrast, 2/20 rats in the untreated group had developed mammary epithelial tumors (one adenofibroma and one adenocarcinoma) but no fibrosarcomas. Dermal exposure to DB(a,i)P caused benign or malignant skin tumors (papilloma or epithelioma) in mice, and subcutaneous injection caused cancer at the injection site (sarcoma) in mice and hamsters. DB(a,i)P was mutagenic in the in the Ames test, in the presence of hepatic post-mitochondrial preparations isolated from the mouse, rat, hamster, and pig. It did not induce DNA damage in mammalian cells in vitro. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: DB(a,i)P induced 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase activity in the rainbow trout liver cell line.",

Although the biological properties of many pure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been investigated, less is known about their effects when present as components of mixtures. As the ability to form DNA adducts in vivo is generally indicative of carcinogenic activity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ...  DNA binding potencies of dibenzo[a,e]pyrene (DB(a,e)P), dibenzo[a,h]pyrene (DB(a,h)P), dibenzo[a,i]pyrene (DB(a,i)P), dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB(a,l)P) and benzo[a]pyrene (B(a)P) /were measured/ when /they were/ applied topically, either singly or in combination, to the skin of male Parkes mice. DNA isolated from the skin and lungs was analyzed by 32P-postlabelling. The adducts formed by each polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exhibited markedly different chromatographic mobilities on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates. The relative binding potencies of the compounds in both skin and lungs were: dibenzo[a,l]pyrene > dibenzo[a,i]pyrene > dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, in good agreement with their reported carcinogenicities in mouse skin. The majority of adducts were removed from DNA within 21 days of treatment, but low levels of adducts were found to persist for at least 3 months in both tissues. When dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene were applied together to mouse skin, a total binding 31% lower than expected was detected, while with a mixture of dibenzo[a,e]pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene the binding to DNA in skin was 65% higher than expected from the binding levels of the carcinogenes when applied singly. Other binary combinations of these three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons gave adduct levels similar to the sum of the binding levels of the individual components when applied singly. The results demonstrate the usefulness of 32P-post-labelling for the assessment of the DNA binding potencies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in mouse tissues, and for the detection of interactions between components of mixtures of carcinogens.",

The mutagenicity of 0.05 nmol of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in strain TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium is inhibited 50% by incubation of the bacteria and the diol epoxide with 150 nmol of ferulic acid, 75 nmol of caffeic acid, 50 nmol of chlorogenic acid or, most strikingly, 1 nmol of ellagic acid in the 0.5-ml incubation mixture. A 3-nmol dose of ellagic acid inhibits mutation induction by 90%. Ellagic acid is also a potent antagonist of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 in Chinese hamster V79 cells. Mutations to 8-azaguanine resistance induced by 0.2 uM diol epoxide are reduced by 50% when tissue culture media also contains 2 uM ellagic acid. Similar to results obtained with the bacteria, ferulic, caffeic, and chlorogenic acids are approximately two orders of magnitude less active than ellagic acid in the mammalian cell assay. The antimutagenic effects of the plant phenols result from their direct interaction with B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2, because a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of diol epoxide disappearance in cell-free solutions of 1:9 dioxane/water, pH 7.0, is observed with all four phenols. In parallel with the mutagenicity studies, ellagic acid is 80-300 times more effective than the other phenols in accelerating the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2. Ellagic acid at 10 uM increases the disappearance of B[a]P 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide-2 by approximately 20-fold relative to the spontaneous and hydronium ion-catalyzed hydrolysis of the diol epoxide at pH 7.0. Ellagic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of the mutagenic activity of bay-region diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, and dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, but higher concentrations of ellagic acid are needed to inhibit the mutagenic activity of the chemically less reactive bay-region diol epoxides of benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benzo[c]phenanthrene. These studies demonstrate that ellagic acid is a potent antagonist of the adverse biological effects of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolites of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and suggest that this naturally occurring plant phenol, normally ingested by humans, may inhibit the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.",

Dibenzo(al)pyrene was nearly 50-fold more potent than benzo(a)pyrene in human cells, but only 60% more mutagenic in Salmonella. The carcinogenic isomer dibenzo(ah)pyrene, though nonmutagenic in bacteria, was active in human cells.",

Benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene and benz[a]anthracene gave a positive mutagenic response only in the presence of activation systems derived from the hamster. With the exception of the pig, activation systems derived from all animal species could convert 3-methylcholanthrene to mutagens, the hamster being the most efficient. With the exception of the rat and pig, all animal species activated 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene to mutagens, the human preparation being the most effective followed by the hamster and mouse. Dibenz[a,h]anthracene was not activated by any of the hepatic preparations. It is concluded that, among the animal species studied the hamster is generally the most efficient in activating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to mutagens in the Ames test.",

No CYP1A induction was observed with benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, acenaphthene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, and fluorene and low induction was found with fluoranthene and phenanthrene. All other PAHs with three and more benzene rings led to a concentration-related induction of CYP1A, with rebound decreases at high concentrations resulting in bell-shaped concentration-activity curves. Fish-related induction equivalency factors (IEFs) were estimated for all PAHs on the basis of EC50 values of their EROD activities and are reported here for the first time. The following order of decreasing IEFs was found: dibenz[a,h]anthracene > dibenzo[a,i]pyrene > benzo[k]fluoranthene > 3-methylcholanthrene > benzo[a]pyrene > benzo[e]pyrene > chrysene > 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene > perylene > benz[a]anthracene > pyrene. In contrast to the EROD activity, the immunodetectable protein content determined by ELISA showed a concentration-dependent increase. The interaction of PAHs in mixtures of up to eight individual compounds was additive based on their EROD activities. In landfill leachates, determined induction equivalents (IEQ) were significantly higher than calculated IEQs based on analytical measurements, which indicates additional unknown inducing compounds present in leachates. This study shows that the PLHC-1 cell in vitro system serves as an integrative bioanalytical tool in the ecotoxicological evaluation of aquatic environmental samples contaminated with CYP1A-inducing compounds.",

When the duration and cell density of exposure were increased, the EC(50) for EROD induction was relatively constant for TCDD, but increased for PAHs. Regardless of exposure conditions, EROD activity was not induced by 9 PAHs: naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, perylene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, fluorene, and fluoranthene. Two PAHs, benzo[g,h,i]perylene and coronene, induced EROD activity inconsistently. The remaining 13 PAHs consistently induced EROD activity. The EC(50)s for induction exhibited approximately a 110-fold range. The order of potency, from most to least potent, was benzo[k]fluoranthene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, dibenzo [a,h]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, pentacene, benzo[b]anthracene, benzo[b] fluorene, chrysene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[e]pyrene, and triphenylene. When the induction potency was expressed relative to TCDD, the toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) ranged from 0.001 to 0.000 01. When expressed relative to benzo[a]pyrene, the TEFs ranged from 3.44 to 0. 03.",

It is present as a component of the total content of PAHs in the environment. Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene occurs in tobacco smoke, gasoline and diesel engine exhaust, stack emissions of waste incinerators, in coal combustion stack emissions, and in curing smoke. Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene occurs in fossil fuels and is released to air from volcanoes and forest fires. There is no commercial production or known use for dibenzo(a,i)pyrene. If released to air, an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 1.8X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenzo(a,i)pyrene will exist almost entirely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. However, a small percentage may exist is the vapor phase. Vapor-phase dibenzo(a,i)pyrene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Particulate-phase dibenzo(a,i)pyrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is expected to have no mobility based upon an experimental Koc of 5.1X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene had biological degradation half-lives of 371 days and 232 days in soil die-away tests using two sandy loam soils. PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,i)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation. Photolysis may occur on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. If released into water, dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9600 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dibenzo(a,i)pyrene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenzo(a,i)pyrene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Volatilization of dibenzo(a,i)pyrene from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(3). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.8X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene had biological degradation half-lives of 371 days and 232 days in soil die-away tests using two sandy loam soils(4). In general, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with five or more benzene rings may not biodegrade readily(5). PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,i)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation(6). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC). Photodegradation of dibenzo(a,i)pyrene was observed in a soil degradation test(4).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 9600(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 7.28(4) and a regression-derived equation(4), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(6). In general, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with five or more benzene rings may not biodegrade readily(7). PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,i)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation(8). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(9) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3).",

Based on an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 1.2X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(2), a small percentage of dibenzo(a,i)pyrene may exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere(1). Similar PAHs have been detected in the vapor phase in ambient air(3,4). Vapor-phase dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase dibenzo(a,i)pyrene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5,6) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

In general, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with five or more benzene rings may not biodegrade readily(2). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene contains six benzene rings. In one biodegradation study, the half-life for the largest PAH studied, benzo(a)pyrene, was 875 days in petroleum-contaminated sediment; rates in pristine sediment were 10 to 400 times slower(3). On this basis, dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is expected to be resistant to biodegradation. PAHs with four or more rings, such as dibenzo(a,i)pyrene, are expected to be resistant to biodegradation(4).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(3,4) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). While no photolysis rates in air or water have been located for dibenzo(a,i)pyrene, photolysis in aqueous media may be rapid in view of the fact that larger polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons tend to photolyze more rapidly than smaller ones(5) and that larger PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene, have a photolysis half-life of 1 hr in sunlight(6). In soil degradation studies using sterilized soil (via bio-inhibiting mercuric chloride), abiotic removal of dibenzo(a,i)pyrene was determined to be 10.3% from Kidman sandy loam and 9.3% from McLaurin sandy loam(7); however, in soils where photodegradation was controlled, loss via abiotic processes did not occur(7).",

However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(3). Some marine organisms have no detectable aryl hydrocarbons hydroxylase enzyme systems, namely: phytoplankton, certain zooplankton, mussels (Mytilus edulis), scallops (Placopecten sp), and snails (Litternia littorea)(4). Those organisms which lack a metabolic detoxification enzyme system, tend to accumulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.1 days has been reported for the analogous compound benzo(a)pyrene(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene was identified but not quantified in sediment samples collected in September, 1995 from the estuaries of the Shinano River, which flows through Nagano and Niigata Prefectures to the Sea of Japan draining both cultivated and urban areas, and Niigata East Port (Japan) which is located in an industrial area(2). Dibenzo(a,i)pyrene was detected, not quantified in sediment from the Black River, Ohio, at 2.8% of total polyaromtaic hydrocarbons present; samples were collected near the outfall of coking ovens used for the production of steel, near Lorain, OH(3). Interface and upper layer bottom sediments collected from the Baltic Sea contained dibenzo(a,i)pyrene concentrations of 51 and 27 ug/kg dry weight respectively(4).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In addition, this section contains information on appropriate engineering controls (e.g., use local exhaust ventilation, or use only in an enclosed system) as well as recommendations for personal protective measures to prevent illness or injury from exposure to chemicals, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., appropriate types of eye, face, skin or respiratory protection needed based on hazards and potential exposure).",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Ronnel is found on List B. Case No: 2590; Pesticide type: Insecticide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): O,O-Dimethyl O-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl) phosphorothioate; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

Ronnel has not been manufactured in the U.S. since 1979. EPA cancelled the registration of all products containing ronnel as the active ingredient on Jan 22, 1991. If released to soil, the loss of ronnel will occur by biodegradation. Loss of ronnel from soil due to volatilization, photolysis, and hydrolysis will be relatively slow. Ronnel is expected to have low mobility in most soils. The major pathway for the loss of ronnel from water appears to be adsorption to suspended solids and sediment. Other losses in water may occur as a result of biodegradation, hydrolysis, and photolysis. The bioconcentration of ronnel in aquatic organisms may be important. Reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals will be an important loss process for vapor phase ronnel in the atmosphere. The half-life of ronnel due to this reaction has been estimated to be 2.1 hrs. Partial removal of ronnel will also occur as a result of dry deposition. Those who apply may be exposed to trace amounts of ronnel from contaminated food consumption. Ronnel is not registered for use in the U.S. and therefore exposure of applicators, other workers will be limited. (SRC)",

There are currently no EPA-registered products and EPA does not believe there are any existing stocks(2). Therefore there should not be any release of ronnel to the environment at the present time. Between its introduction in 1954 and the time when stocks were depleted, ronnel was released to the environment during its primary use for controlling insects on lifestock and other uses, such as controlling insects in food storage areas(1-2).",

Hydrolysis of ronnel was not accelerated by sediment-sorption which suggests that soil catalyzed hydrolysis should not be important(2,SRC). The Koc values estimated from water solubility and Kow(3-4), and regression equations(5) indicate that the leaching potential of ronnel from soil is low. Based on its low vapor pressure(3), moderate Henry's Law constant(3) and high Koc value, volatilization should not be important for the dissipation of ronnel from soil(SRC). In soil the biodegradation of ronnel may be fast since the mean half-life in surface waters is 8.4 days(6).",

The hydrolysis is faster at alkaline pH(1,7) and the hydrolysis half-life is reduced to 6 hrs in the presence of 0.1 mmole copper (II) catalyst(3). Although ronnel readily photolyses with light of wavelength less than 290, the rate of photolysis is slow in water with natural sunlight(4-5) and the half-life due to sunlight photolysis at near surface of a water body is 17.5 days based on 12 hr daylight(5). Biodegradation of ronnel in surface waters has a mean half-life of 8.4 days and the rate can be accelerated by adding inorganic nutrients to water(6).",

This and the Koc values of 3.64-4.09 estimated from regression equations(3) indicate that ronnel would remain strongly adsorbed to suspended solids and sediment in water. Based on the Henry's Law constant value of 3.2X10-5 atm-cu m/mole estimated from the ratio of the vapor pressure and water solubility(2), volatilization half-life from a model river is estimated to be 1.4 days and from a model pond to be 24.8 days considering the effect of adsorption(2,5,SRC). However, the importance of volatilization from water will substantially decrease due to strong adsorption of ronnel to suspended solid and sediment(SRC). A lipid weight basis bioconcentration factor of 43650 in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)(4) indicates that bioconcentration of ronnel in aquatic organisms will be important(SRC).",

Both the higher temperature and the presence of ethanol increased the rate of hydrolysis(5). In aqueous solution and at room temperature, the hydrolysis rate is several hundred times slower(5). When ronnel was dissolved in equimolar KOH in 95% ethanol, it was found to hydrolyze both at the alkyl-phosphate and aryl-phosphate bonds with the formation of dimethyl phosphoric acid, dimethyl phosphorothioic acid and O-methyl-O-trichlorophenyl phosphorothioic acid(4).",

The neutral hydrolysis rate in the sediment-sorbed phase was the same as the neutral hydrolysis rate in the aqueous phase. In contrast, the alkaline hydrolysis in the sediment-sorbed phase was much slower than in the aqueous phase(1-2). The hydrolysis of ronnel in water is accelerated in the presence of copper(II) catalysts(3). Ronnel decomposed readily with low wavelength (less than 290 nm) UV lights(4-5). When irradiated with a low pressure mercury lamp, the first order photodecomposition half-life of a 50 ppb solution of ronnel was about 12 mins. However, the photodecomposition of ronnel with sunlight was slow(4,6) and the estimated half-life near the surface of a water body during summer was 17.5 days(6). Photolysis of ronnel is 22 times faster in the presence of algae found in natural waters(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

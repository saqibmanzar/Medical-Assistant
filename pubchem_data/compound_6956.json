When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If released to soil, phthalamide should have very high mobility. Volatilization of phthalamide may not be important from moist or dry soil surfaces. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of phthalamide in soil or water. If released to water, phthalamide would not adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Phthalamide would be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces. An estimated BCF value of 0.03 suggests that phthalamide will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. If released to the atmosphere, phthalamide will exist primarily in the particulate phase. Vapor-phase phthalamide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 3.4 days. Particulate-phase phthalamide may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

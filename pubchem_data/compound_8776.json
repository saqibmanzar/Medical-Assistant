The high and low concentrations of nithiazide utilized were, respectively, 1,250 and 625 ppm for rats and 5,000 and 2,500 ppm for mice. /Due to shortage, nithiazide was not administered for 9 of the 104 weeks./ ...Twenty animals of each sex and species were placed on test as controls. ...There was no significant positive association between dosage and mortality for either rats or mice. Compound-related mean body weight /gain/ depression occurred in both sexes of each species. Statistically significant incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas were found in high dose male mice but not in female mice. ...Statistically significant increased incidences of a combination of mammary and skin fibroadenomas and cystadenomas NOS were found in the high dose female rats. ...Under the conditions of this bioassay, nithiazide was carcinogenic in male and probably female B6C3F1 mice, causing a combination of hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatocellular adenomas. Nithiazide was also carcinogenic in female Fischer 344 rats, causing an increase in the incidence of mammary neoplasms. The compound was not carcinogenic in male Fischer 344 rats.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.3X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates nithiazide will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase nithiazide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.1 days. Particulate-phase nithiazide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, nithiazide is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 670. The pKa of nithiazide is 7.3, indicating that this compound will partially exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-15 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, nithiazide is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 90 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to nithiazide may occur by dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where nithiazide is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-15 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). The pKa of nithiazide is 7.3(2), indicating that this compound will partially exist in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 90(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

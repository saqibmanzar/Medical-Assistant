On September 22, 1981, ipodate was submitted again by the company Schering AG but it is currently under an inactive status.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

This includes pKa (the negative logarithm of the acid dissociation constant) and pKb (the negative logarithm of the base dissociation constant).",

It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia. Butalbital has a low degree of selectivity and a narrow therapeutic index. Typically indicated to manage tension (or muscle contraction) headaches, butalbital is often combined with one or more therapeutic agents, such as acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. There have not been clinical trials that evaluate the clinical efficacy of butalbital in migraines thus it is not indicated for such condition. As with other barbiturates, butalbital carries a risk of abuse or misuse potential, intoxication, hangover, tolerance, dependence, and overdosage possibly leading to death. Butalbital\u2010containing analgesics can also produce a drug\u2010induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The butalbital-containing compounds are efficacious in placebo-controlled trials among patients with episodic tension-type headaches. Despite their frequent clinical use for migraine, they have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials among patients with migraine. Barbiturates can produce intoxication, hangover, tolerance, dependence, and toxicity. Butalbital can result in intoxication that is clinically indistinguishable from that produced by alcohol. Butalbital-containing analgesics can produce drug-induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Higher doses can produce withdrawal syndromes after discontinuation. Butalbital-containing analgesics may be effective as backup medications or when other medications are ineffective or cannot be used. Because of concerns about overuse, medication-overuse headache, and withdrawal, their use should be limited and carefully monitored.",

Barbiturates exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties and they are capable of producing all levels of CNS mood alteration from excitation to mild sedation, hypnosis, and deep coma. The sedative dose of butalbital in nontolerant individuals is 5-100 mg and the hypnotic dose is 100-200 mg. Pain perception and reaction are relatively unimpaired until the moment of unconsciousness. In some cases, an unwanted paradoxical response of excitement may be observed instead of sedation with barbiturate treatment, which may be due to their depressant effects on inhibitory centers of the CNS. At sufficiently high therapeutic doses, barbiturates induce anesthesia; however, barbiturates are reported to lose their effectiveness for sleep induction and sleep maintenance after 2 weeks. Barbiturates are habit-forming; they can produce tolerance and both dependence and addiction, which is partly explained by decreased drug concentration at the site of action due to enhanced drug metabolism by induced enzymes, or to cellular adaptive changes. In addition, butalbital may lead to analgesic overuse headache.   While butalbital is expected to mediate similar actions as other members of the barbiturate drug class, the effects of butalbital in isolation are not well understood. It is suggested that butalbital is added in combination products to antagonize the unwanted central stimulating effect of stimulatory ingredients such as caffeine. Butalbital may decrease blood pressure and heart rate when administered at sedative and hypnotic doses.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Barbiturates primarily mediate suppressive actions on polysynaptic neuronal responses by diminishing facilitation while enhancing inhibition. Inhibition occurs at GABAergic synapses that express GABA-A receptors, which are transmembrane chloride ion channels that bind an inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neurosteroids, and ethanol. Upon activation, GABA-A receptors allow Cl- influx and K+ efflux into the postjunctional terminal, resulting in inhibition of the postsynaptic neuron. It is suggested that barbiturates, including butalbital, enhances GABA binding to the GABA-A receptors by binding to the \u03b1+/\u03b2\u2212 interface in the intracellular domain (ICD) as an allosteric modulator. Additionally, barbiturates promote benzodiazepine binding to the receptor. Barbiturates potentiate GABA-induced increases in chloride conductance and depress voltage-activated calcium currents while prolonging the duration of GABA-induced chloride channel opening. Butalbital may also inhibit the excitatory effects mediated by AMPA receptors by reducing glutamate-induced depolarizations of the receptor. It is also proposed that barbiturates and opioids may potentiate the analgesic effects of each other when co-administered, although there are inconsistencies across preclinical data.",

Robust c-fos-LI was observed within nuclei of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis after capsaicin (329 +/- 35). Butalbital dose-dependently reduced the number of labeled cells to a maximum of 66% (1000 micrograms/kg intraperitoneally [i.p.], P < .01) in lamina I, IIo but not within area postrema, medial reticular nucleus, or the nucleus of the solitary tract. Pretreatment with bicuculline (30 micrograms/kg i.p.) blocked the effect of butalbital, thereby suggesting the importance of the GABAA receptor to activation involved in the transmission of nociceptive information. Our studies suggest the possibility that GABAA receptors might provide an important therapeutic target in migraine and related headache disorders.",

Blood concentrations of her antidepressant, imipramine, were within normal range and consistent with past concentrations. Her medical history was significant for a chronic headache disorder for which she was given a prescription containing butalbital on admission. The patient's depressive disorder was quickly controlled but relapsed 2 weeks later. Concentrations of imipramine showed a decrease of approximately 50%. Imipramine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 (CYP 1A2) system, and barbiturates are known inducers of this enzyme subset.",

The average daily dose for the barbiturate addict is usually about 1500 mg. As tolerance to barbiturates develops, the amount needed to maintain the same level of intoxication increases; tolerance to a fatal dosage, however, does not increase more than two-fold. As this occurs, the margin between an intoxication dosage and fatal dosage becomes smaller. The lethal dose of a barbiturate is far less if alcohol is also ingested. Major withdrawal symptoms (convulsions and delirium) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these drugs. Intensity of withdrawal symptoms gradually declines over a period of approximately 15 days. Treatment of barbiturate dependence consists of cautious and gradual withdrawal of the drug. Barbiturate-dependent patients can be withdrawn by using a number of different withdrawal regimens. One method involves initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and gradually decreasing the daily dosage as tolerated by the patient."

She developed a florid withdrawal delirium following the discontinuation of a drug she purchased online. The medication, which contained butalbital, was self-administered in escalating doses for the treatment of chronic headaches. Daily doses of up to 750 mg to 1000 mg were reported. The patient was admitted to the hospital for the treatment of unexplained seizures that were followed by several days of an intense withdrawal syndrome. Little improvement was noted after the administration of benzodiazepines and phenothiazine. After parenteral phenobarbital administration, her symptoms resolved. The withdrawal state from barbiturates is similar to that from ethanol. Tolerance can develop with prolonged abuse, leading to escalating drug doses to achieve the desired effect.",

Particulate-phase butalbital will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Butalbital does contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, butalbital is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 26. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Boidegradation data were not available. If released into water, butalbital is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to butalbital may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where butalbital is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to butalbital via ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Exposure to butalbital among the general population may be limited to those administered the analgesic drugs containing this compound. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It was detected in 83% of samples (maximum concentration = 0.08 ug/L) from twenty-three plants across the US that were analyzed once between 2004 and 2009 as part of a National Survey; more than half of these plants receive hospital discharge.

The enantiomers of DBAJAC-3,4-DHD were prepared from the separable diastereoisomeric esters with (+)-endo-1,4,5,6,7,7-hexachlorobicyclo(2.2.1)hept-5-ene-2-carboxyl ic acid (HCA). The absolute configuration of trans-3(R),4(R)-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrodibenz[a,j]acridine was assigned by conversion to the bis[p-(dimethylamino)benzoate] and examination of the exciton coupling in its circular dichroic (CD) spectrum. The 3(R),4(R)-tetrahydrodiol was converted to DBAJAC-3(R),4(R)-DHD. The enantiomers of DBAJAC 5,6-oxide were partially resolved by chiral stationary-phase chromatography, and subsequent methoxide attack afforded two enantiomerically enriched isomeric ethers from each fraction. The structures of the two ethers from each enantiomer were determined, and from their 1H NMR spin-spin coupling between the H5 and H6 signals and the CD spectra of the ethers, the absolute configuration of the ethers, and hence the 5,6-oxides, was determined. The enantiomeric composition of the 3,4-dihydrodiol and 5,6-oxide formed as microsomal metabolites of rat liver preparations was 69% 3R,4R and 81% 5R,6S, respectively. When rats were pretreated with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), these percentages were 70% and 5%, indicating a reversed stereochemical preference for oxide formation in the MC-induced preparation. ...",

No-treatment, acetone and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-treated animals were used as negative and positive control groups. DBC (50 nmol), DBA (50 nmol), BaP (50 nmol) or DBC plus BaP (25 nmol + 25 nmol) were applied twice weekly in 50 uL acetone to the backs of 50 female mice/group for 99 weeks or until the appearance of a tumor. DBC, DBA, BaP and DBC plus BaP produced skin tumors in 43, 32, 49 and 42 of 50 mice each based on weekly visual observations with latent periods of 55.1, 62.2, 33.4 and 33.8 weeks, respectively. The histopathology data indicated primary skin lesions in 42, 27, 48 and 47 mice for DBC, DBA, BaP and DBC plus BaP, respectively. ...",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.1X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenz(a,j)acridine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase dibenz(a,j)acridine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Dibenz(a,j)acridine absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dibenz(a,j)acridine is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 7.7X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenz(a,j)acridine may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing activated sludge from 3 municipal treatment plants, 0-10.4% of the theoretical oxygen demand was reached in 144 hours, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in  soil or water. If released into water, dibenz(a,j)acridine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Based on a measured BCF of 100 for analogous dibenz(a,h)acridine, bioconcentration of dibenz(a,j)acrdine in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to dibenz(a,j)acridine is by inhalation due to the release of this substance from combustion fuels, incineration effluent, automobile exhaust, and cigarette smoke.

At a sludge concentration of 5000 mg/L, 0.8 and 4.9% of the theoretical oxygen demand was reached at 24 and 144 hours, respectively. Nashville at 2500 mg/L activated sludge gave 0.6%, 3.3%, and 4.7% of the theoretical oxygen demand at 24, 72, and 144 hours, respectively. At a sludge concentration of 5000 mg/L; 0.2 and 10.4% of the theoretical oxygen demand was reached at 24 and 144 hours, respectively. Dibenz(a,j)acridine was toxic to the Franklin sludge.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The concentration of dibenz(a,j)acridine in the average American urban atmosphere was determined to be 0.3 ug/g airborne particles or 0.04 ug/1000 cu m air(2). Dibenz(a,j)acridine was detected during the measurement of aerosols in Belgium at two monitoring stations from 1976-1979. The mass median equivalent diameter ranged from 0.61-1.2 um(3). Urban atmospheric air from Tokyo showed dibenz(a,j)acridine at a concentration of 0.43 ug/g of particulates; this compares to a concentration of 0.3 ug/g of particulates as measured in the United States and a concentration of 6 ug/g of particulates as measured for coal tar pitch polluted air(4). Dibenz(a,j)acridine was measured at concentrations of 0.2 and 0.07 ng/cu m air for a residential area and a busy street, respectively, in Copenhagen in February in 1976-1982(5).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Km and Vmax values were determined for nasal and liver microsomal metabolism of benzyl cyanide to cyanide. 4. Vmax values were all greater in nasal microsomes than in liver microsomes. Except for acrylonitrile, butyronitrile and isobutyronitrile metabolism, the ethmoturbinate microsomes had higher activities than the maxilloturbinate microsomes. 5. Two methods for determining Vmax values indicate that rat liver, but not the nose, contains at least two cytochrome P-450 isozymes involved in metabolism of benzyl cyanide to cyanide. 6. These results, and previously reported nasal rhodanese activity data, indicate that inhaled organonitriles are substantially detoxicated in the nasal cavity.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate) may be followed by respiratory depression. Lung hemorrhage and pulmonary edema may occur. Headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, giddiness, salivation, nausea, and vomiting may be followed by combative behavior, convulsions, and coma. Isobutyronitrile is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as intermediate for insecticides, solvent, as a catalyst in the polymerization of ethylene. HUMAN STUDIES: Potential symptoms of overexposure are irritation of eyes, skin, nose, throat; headache, dizziness, weakness, giddiness, confusion, convulsions, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. Cases of inhalation exposure included loss of consciousnesses, tonic-clonic movements of the arms, dilated pupils, weak pulse, shallow and gasping breathing, and cyanosis. ANIMAL STUDIES: Local effects in rabbit's eyes included reddening of eyelids and conjunctiva, edema, and tearing. Vapor inhalation at a calculated concentration of 5500 ppm for approximately 1 hr killed all rats. In rats and mice exposed orally the symptoms were those of weakness, vasodilation, tremors, and convulsions. Thiocyanate was present in the urine. Rats exposed at 38.6 mg/kg orally showed definite parenchymatous degeneration of the liver, with male rats showing a greater degree of degeneration than females. Increased weight of stomach, liver, and adrenal glands were found at doses of 200 mg/kg orally. It was concluded that 2-methylpropanenitrile causes hepatic damage. In rabbits the direct cause of death after iv administration was respiratory arrest from depression of the central mechanism of ventilation control. The mice showed central nervous system signs such as respiratory paralysis, slight hyperkinesia, increase in frequency and amplitude of respiration, clonic movements of limbs, diminution of pain sensitivity, and decreased frequency in respiration with cessation and death at 20-30 min after injection.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 32.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methylpropanenitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methylpropanenitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 days. 2-Methylpropanenitrile does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methylpropanenitrile is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 37. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Methylpropanenitrile is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 53.9% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 2-methylpropanenitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 hours and 7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-methylpropanenitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methylpropanenitrile is produced or used especially at coal gasification and shale oil processing facilities. The general population is likely to be exposed to 2-methylpropanenitrile from smoking cigarettes and inhalation of cigarette smoke. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 hours and 7 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

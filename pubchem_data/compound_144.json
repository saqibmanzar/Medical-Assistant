An accumulation of 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan in cerebrospinal fluid occurs in Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (OMIM 608643), accompanied by an increased excretion in the urine of the patients, which are indicative of the disorder but not specific 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is also increased in other disorders such as in Parkinson's patients with severe postural instability and gait disorders. Confirmation of the diagnosis AADC deficiency is then required by enzyme activity measurement or genetic analysis. The amount of endogenous 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan available for serotonin synthesis depends on the availability of tryptophan and on the activity of various enzymes, especially tryptophan hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.4), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.52), and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. (EC 1.13.11.11, TDO). 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been used clinically for over 30 years. In addition to depression, the therapeutic administration of 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan has been shown to be effective in treating a wide variety of conditions, including fibromyalgia, insomnia, binge eating associated with obesity, cerebellar ataxia, and chronic headaches. 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and effectively increases central nervous system (CNS) synthesis of serotonin. Supplementation with 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan is hypothesized to normalize serotonin synthesis, which is putatively related to its antidepressant properties.  (A3384, A3385, A3386).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

An increase of intrasynaptic serotonin tends to reduce food consumption.

There are few studies on the effects of 5-HTP on obesity and they suggest an anorectic effect of 5-HTP.",

Chronic subcutaneous infusion L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP, 12.6 mg/day) by osmotic minipumps significantly decreased the elevated systolic blood pressure of DS rats on a 4% NaCl diet. Blood pressures of DR rats were unaffected by treatment with L-5-HTP. Cardiac hypertrophy was associated with Dahl salt-induced hypertension. However, treatment with L-5-HTP failed to reduce the weight of the heart significantly. These results suggest that chronic administration of L-5-HTP was effective in reducing the elevated blood pressure in the DS model. The specific mechanisms by which L-5-HTP reduces the elevated blood pressure in DS rats is not clear and remains for further study.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Decreases in both the metabolic rate (rate of oxygen consumption) and colonic temperature also occur. These responses are similar to those observed following acute administration of angiotensin II. However, both drinking and the increase in tail skin temperature are unaffected by prior administration of the non-peptide angiotensin II, AT-1 receptor antagonist, losartan potassium, but are partially attenuated by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol. This suggests that the responses are independent of the angiotensin AT-1 receptor but may be mediated, in part at least, by the beta-adrenoceptor.",

In the present study, undernourished pigeons with previously consolidated dominance were submitted to subchronic and chronic 5-HTP treatment. Adult males (n = 28) were kept at 80% of their body weight by a restricted diet. These were divided in pairs made of a previously ranked dominant subject (total time spent in aggression higher than 200 sec/20 min) and a submissive one of similar body weight (time spent in aggression between 90 and 150 sec/20 min). The same pairs were exposed to a daily 20 min interaction during each experiment in an observation chamber bearing a central feeder. The time spent in aggressive behavior, feeder control behavior and eating behavior was recorded. Intratest body weight gain was also recorded. In Experiment 1, 8 pairs of pigeons were exposed to a daily trial for 4 successive days (pretreatment-scores). The dominant subjects were then injected subcutaneously, 30 min before trials, with 7.5 mg/kg 5-HTP from day 5 to day 8 (Treatment scores). The Recovery scores were obtained through a 4-trial post-treatment schedule. In Experiment 2 different pigeons were used. The pretreatment and recovery scores were obtained according to a 16-trial schedule (16 days). Both 4-day (subchronic) and 16-day (chronic) 5-HTP treatments attenuated aggression by the dominant subjects and reduced their intra-test body weight gain but did not decrease dominance for feeder control. The recovery scores of total aggression in subchronic experiments returned to pretreatment scores. In chronic experiments, instead, the recovery scores of aggression remained lower than pretreatment scores, whereas body-weight-gain scores came back to pretreatment values. This suggests that dominant subjects submitted to chronic 5-HTP might have learned to maintain dominance and feeder control in a virtual absence of aggressive behavior.",

Live fetuses were dissected from the uterus & evaluated for live litter size, body weight, sex & gross morphological abnormalities. All live fetuses were examined for visceral malformations employing the Staples' fresh tissue dissection method. Half of the fetuses were decapitated prior to dissection & the heads were fixed in Bouin's solution for free-hand sectioning & exam (Wilson's technique). All fetal carcasses were stained with Alizarin Red S & examined for skeletal malformations. The maternal mortality rate in the present study was 0.0% for all dose groups. A significant dose-response trend (p<0.05) for reduction in maternal body weight was observed on gestational days 11, 15 & 17, but not on gestational days O or 6 (immediately prior to onset of dosing), with no significant pairwise comparisons. There was also a downward significant trend for maternal weight gain during gestation period & during treatment period but no significant pairwise comparisons. At sacrifice on gestational day 17 a dose-response trend was evident for reduction in maternal liver weight, with the values from L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-150 & L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-450 dams significantly reduced relative to controls. Relative maternal liver weight & absolute & relative kidney weight values did not vary among dose groups. The following clinical signs: maternal weight loss of 1 gram or more/day (considered to be an indication of toxicity in individual dams), alopecia, piloerection, rough coat, unthriftiness, diarrhea & hyperactivity were all exhibited by dams in a clear dose-dependent manner. Data concerning the status of uterine implantation sites exhibited a variable response. There were no statistically significant dose- related differences for number of implantation sites/dam, number or % of resorptions, fetal deaths, nonlive fetuses (dead plus resorbed) or affected fetuses (non-live plus malformed)/litter, or for the number or proportion of litters with one or more resorptions, fetal deaths, non-live, or affected fetuses. In live litters (i.e. litters with one or more live fetuses) there was no difference in the number of live fetuses/litter or in the proportion of males to females/litter across treatment groups. Body weights of live fetuses in toto, or for male & female fetuses separately, from L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-treated litters exhibited a significant downward dose-response trend, with values from L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-300 & L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-450 dams significantly reduced relative to controls. There were no significant differences among treated & control litters in the number or percentages of males, females or live fetuses malformed nor in the number or percentages of litters with malformed fetuses. Exam of malformation incidence by category produced no evidence of overall dose-response trends, although exencephaly & trilateral open eye were seen in fetuses only from L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-150, L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-300 & L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-450 dose groups. In conclusion, no evidence for teratogenicity of L-5- hydroxytryptophan was seen in pregnant CD-1 mice when administered in corn oil by gavage during the time of organogenesis at doses which produced marginal evidence of maternal toxicity (clinical signs & trends for reduced body weights & weight gain), & evidence of fetal toxicity as indicated by a highly significant dose-response trend toward decreased fetal weight, with significantly lower values in the L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-300 & L-5-Hydroxytryptophan-450 groups relative to controls.",

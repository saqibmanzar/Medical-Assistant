Chemical analysis is performed via laser-excited time-resolved Shpol'skii spectroscopy with the aid of a cryogenic fiber-optic probe, pulsed tunable dye laser, spectrograph, and intensified charge-coupled device. Unambiguous identification is accomplished via wavelength time matrix formats, which give simultaneous access to spectral and lifetime information. Prior to spectroscopic analysis, HPLC fractions are pre-treated with liquid-liquid extraction or solid-liquid extraction at the tip of the fiber-optic probe. Solid-liquid extraction gives the best limits of detection, which vary from 40 pg/mL (dibenzo[a,l]pyrene) to 0.2 ng/mL (dibenzo[e,l]pyrene).",

Its four isomers, which include dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]pyrene, and dibenzo[e,l]pyrene, are also carcinogenic and, therefore, a potential threat to humans. The method presented here provides a direct way for their determination in water samples. The entire procedure--from water extraction to LETRSS analysis--takes less than 15 min/sample and it consumes only 100 uL of organic solvent. This fact makes our approach environmentally friendly and cost-effective. Unambiguous isomer determination is accomplished via multidimensional data formats, namely, wavelength time matrixes, excitation-emission matrixes, and time-resolved excitation-emission matrixes. The analytical figures of merit demonstrate precise and accurate analysis at the sub-parts-per-billion level. Limits of detection are at the parts-per-trillion level. The potential of this approach for real-world analysis is illustrated with a heavily contaminated water samples.",

The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated with two isomers of molecular weight 302 with identical mass fragmentation patterns, namely dibenzo[a,i]pyrene and naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene. Qualitative and quantitative analysis is carried out via laser-excited time-resolved Shpol'skii spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. Unambiguous identification of co-eluted isomers is based on their characteristic 4.2 K line-narrowed spectra in n-octane as well as their fluorescence lifetimes. Pre-concentration of HPLC fractions prior to spectroscopic analysis is performed with the aid of gold nanoparticles via an environmentally friendly procedure. In addition to the two co-eluted isomers, the analytical figures of merit of the entire procedure were evaluated with dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene and dibenzo[a,e]pyrene. The analytical recoveries from drinking water samples varied between 98.2 +/- 5.5 (dibenzo[a,l]pyrene) and 102.7 +/- 3.2% (dibenzo[a,i]pyrene). The limits of detection ranged from 51.1 ng/L (naphtho[2,3-a]pyrene) to 154 ng/L (dibenzo[a,e]pyrene). The excellent analytical figures of merit associated to its HPLC compatibility makes this approach an attractive alternative for the analysis of co-eluted isomers with identical mass spectra.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Although the biological properties of many pure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been investigated, less is known about their effects when present as components of mixtures. As the ability to form DNA adducts in vivo is generally indicative of carcinogenic activity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we have compared the DNA binding potencies of dibenzo(a,e)pyrene (DB(a,e)P), dibenzo(a,h)pyrene (DB(a,h)P), dibenzo(a,i)pyrene (DB(a,i)P), dibenzo(a,l)pyrene (DB(a,l)P) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), when applied topically, either singly or in combination, to the skin of male Parkes mice. DNA isolated from the skin and lungs was analyzed by (32)P-postlabelling. The adducts formed by each polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exhibited markedly different chromatographic mobilities on polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates. The relative binding potencies of the compounds in both skin and lungs were: dibenzo(a,l)pyrene > dibenzo(a,i)pyrene > dibenzo(a,e)pyrene, in good agreement with their reported carcinogenicities in mouse skin. The majority of adducts were removed from DNA within 21 days of treatment, but low levels of adducts were found to persist for at least 3 months in both tissues. When dibenzo(a,l)pyrene, dibenzo(a,e)pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene were applied together to mouse skin, a total binding 31% lower than expected was detected, while with a mixture of dibenzo(a,e)pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene the binding to DNA in skin was 65% higher than expected from the binding levels of the carcinogenes when applied singly. Other binary combinations of these three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons gave adduct levels similar to the sum of the binding levels of the individual components when applied singly. The results demonstrate the usefulness of (32)P-post-labelling for the assessment of the DNA binding potencies of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in mouse tissues, and for the detection of interactions between components of mixtures of carcinogens.",

In order to better assess the health risks associated with this class of compounds, a total of 67 polycyclic aromatic compounds that either have been identified (55) or are suspected to be present (12) in urban aerosol samples were tested for mutagenicity in a forward mutation assay based on human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The cell line used (designated hlAlv2) constitutively expresses the cytochrome p4501Al, which is known to be necessary for the metabolism of many promutagens. The polycyclic aromatic compounds tested included 39 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), 19 oxygen-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxy-PAH) and nine NO2-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAH). A total of 26 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were mutagenic. In comparing the minimum mutagenic concentrations of the mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with that of benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P) it was found that dibenzo(a,l)pyrene (DB(al)P), cyclopenta(c,d))pyrene (CPP), naphtho(2,1-a)pyrene, dibenzo(a,e)pyrene (DB(ae)P) and l-methylbenzo(a)pyrene were 24 + or - 21, 6.9 + or - 4.2, 3.2 + or - 3.0, 2.9 + or - 2.9 and 1.6 + or - 1.4 times, respectively, more mutagenic than benzo(a)pyrene, and that dibenzo(a,k)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene were approximately equally mutagenic. The 19 other mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were between tested only phenalenone, 7H-benz(d,e)anthracen-7-one, 3-nitro-6H-dibenzo(b,d)pyran-6-one, cyclopenta(c,d)pyren-3(4H)-one, 6H-benzo(c,d)pyren-6-one (BPK) and anthanthrenequinone were mutagenic; however, with the exception of 6H-benzo(c,d)pyren-6-one, these were over 50 times less active than benzo(a)pyrene. 6H-benzo(c,d)pyren-6-one was benzo(a)pyrene. Seven of the nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were mutagenic including 9-nitroanthracene, l-nitrofluoranthene, 3-nitrofluoranthene, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene (1,6-DNP) and 1,8-dinitropyrene. 1,6-dinitropyrene wasnic nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were between 20 and 380 times less active than benzo(a)pyrene. These results are discussed in terms of their relevance for determining the most important mutagens in ambient air. Based on reported concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds in ambient aerosols, it is possible that cyclopenta(c,d))pyrene, dibenzo(a,e)pyrene, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene and 6H-benzo(c,d)pyren-6-one could account for a greater proportion of the mutagenicity than benzo(a)pyrene in some aerosols.",

The primary objectives of this study are to investigate the risk of 22 combined atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and to find major contributing compounds that can act as adequate indicators for estimating the risk. The average lifetime cancer risk for all 22 PAHs in winter was 1.7 x 10(-4) in the Yokohama residential area. Although benzo[a]pyrene has been considered to be a useful indicator in many countries, the present study also showed that benzo[a]pyrene contributed only ca. 40% of the total cancer risk for all 22 PAHs, as calculated by unit risk. Six PAHs (dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]perylene, dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene) contributed 93% of the overall risk. Therefore, these six PAHs, including the high molecular ones, would be better indicators of the risk than benzo[a]pyrene alone. The secondary objective of this study is to reveal the PAHs that are major contributors to the deposition that contribute to the total deposition of PAHs in the human respiratory tract. The results revealed that the same six PAHs identified using unit risk evaluation were large contributors in all five parts of the respiratory tracts in adult males in spite of deposition process. It was concluded that the reason for this was that these six PAHs had the same size distributions, of which the 0.43-1.1 um fraction was the largest, about 57-70% of the whole concentration.",

It is present as a component of the total content of PAHs in the environment. Dibenzo(a,e)pyrene occurs in tobacco smoke, gasoline and diesel engine exhaust, stack emissions of waste incinerators, in coal combustion stack emissions, and in curing smoke. Dibenzo(a,e)pyrene occurs in fossil fuels and is released to air from volcanoes and forest fires. There is no commercial production or known use for dibenzo(a,e)pyrene. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.2X10-11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenzo(a,e)pyrene will exist almost entirely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. However, a small percentage may exist is the vapor phase. Vapor-phase dibenzo(a,e)pyrene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Particulate-phase dibenzo(a,e)pyrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dibenzo(a,e)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dibenzo(a,e)pyrene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6.5X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenzo(a,e)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available; however, PAHs with five or more benzene rings may not biodegrade readily. Photolysis may occur on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. If released into water, dibenzo(a,e)pyrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9700 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dibenzo(a,e)pyrene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibenzo(a,e)pyrene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenzo(a,e)pyrene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 9700(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 7.28(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).

Based on an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 1.3X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(2), a small percentage of dibenzo(a,e)pyrene may exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere(1). Similar PAHs have been detected in the vapor phase in ambient air(3,4). Vapor-phase dibenzo(a,e)pyrene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase dibenzo(a,e)pyrene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Dibenzo(a,e)pyrene has been detected in dry atmospheric deposition(5). Dibenzo(a,e)pyrene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(6,7) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

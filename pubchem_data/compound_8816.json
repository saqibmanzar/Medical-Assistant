When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Cetylpyridinium bromide is found on List C. Case No: 3013; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide, rodenticide, antimicrobial; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered ... The case /is characterized/ as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): Cetylpyridinium bromide; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered pesticide products ... \"cancelled.\"",

If released to air, cetylpyridinium bromide will exist in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere as an ion. Particulate-phase cetylpyridinium bromide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, cetylpyridinium bromide is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 240. However, quaternary ammonium compounds are known to sorb strongly, and rapidly in well-mixed systems, to a wide variety of materials (such as sewage sludge, sediment, clay) and the mobility of cetylpyridinium bromide in soil may be considerably less than the estimated value. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process as this compound is expected to exist in the environment in the dissociated form. Cetylpyridinium bromide will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Cetylpyridinium bromide is expected to biodegrade rapidly in aerobic soil and water environments based on studies using sewage; rates of biodegradation increased with acclimation of the microbial population. If released into water, cetylpyridinium bromide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc; however, it is a quaternary ammonium compounds and based on this is expected to adsorb strongly to suspended solids and sediment in the water. Volatilization from water surfaces will not be an important fate process as this compound is expected to exist in the dissociated form in the environment. BCF values of 21, 22, and 13, measured for clams, fathead minnows, and tadpoles, respectively suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis of cetylpyridinium bromide is not expected due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to cetylpyridinium bromide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cetylpyridinium bromide is produced or used. The general population will most likely be exposed to cetylpyridinium bromide via dermal contact with consumer products containing cetylpyridinium bromide. (SRC)",

However, quaternary ammonium compounds are known to sorb strongly, and rapidly in well-mixed systems, to a wide variety of materials (such as sewage sludge, sediment, clay)(5) and the mobility of cetylpyridinium bromide in soil may be considerably less than estimated. Volatilization of cetylpyridinium bromide from moist soil surfaces is not expected as this compound is a salt(SRC). Cetylpyridinium bromide is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 4.3X10-7 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(4). Cetylpyridinium bromide is expected to biodegrade rapidly in the environment(SRC) based on studies using sewage(5,6); rates of biodegradation increased with acclimation of the microbial population(5,6).",

However, quaternary ammonium compounds are known to sorb strongly, and rapidly in well-mixed systems, to a wide variety of materials (such as sewage sludge, sediment, clay)(7); therefore, cetylpyridinium bromide should be strongly adsorbed to suspended solids and sediment in water. This compound is expected to exist in the dissociated form in the environment and therefore volatilization from water surfaces will not be an important fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(4), BCF values of 21, 22, and 13, measured for clams, fathead minnows, and tadpoles, respectively(5), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Cetylpyridinium bromide is expected to biodegrade rapidly in the environment(SRC) based on studies using sewage(7,8); rates of biodegradation increased with acclimation of the microbial population(7,8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The Koc of cetylpyridinium bromide is estimated as 240(SRC), using a measured log Kow of 1.83(2) and a regression-derived equation(3). According to a classification scheme(4), this estimated Koc value suggests that cetylpyridinium bromide is expected to have moderate mobility in soil. However, quaternary ammonium compounds are known to sorb strongly, and rapidly in well-mixed systems, to a wide variety of materials (such as sewage sludge, sediment, clay)(5) and the mobility of cetylpyridinium bromide in soil may be considerably less than estimated(SRC).",

It is an antibiotic produced by Streptomyces garyphalus or S. orchidaceus and is used as part of a multi-drug regimen for the treatment of tuberculosis when resistance to, or toxicity from, primary drugs has developed. An analogue of D-alanine, it interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis in the cytoplasm by competitive inhibition of L-alanine racemase (which forms D-alanine from L-alanine) and D-alanine--D-alanine ligase (which incorporates D-alanine into the pentapeptide required for peptidoglycan formation and bacterial cell wall synthesis). It has a role as an antitubercular agent, an antiinfective agent, an antimetabolite, a metabolite and a NMDA receptor agonist. It is an organooxygen heterocyclic antibiotic, an organonitrogen heterocyclic antibiotic and a 4-amino-1,2-oxazolidin-3-one. It is a conjugate base of a D-cycloserine(1+). It is an enantiomer of a L-cycloserine. It is a tautomer of a D-cycloserine zwitterion.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

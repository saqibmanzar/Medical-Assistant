Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Investigations have been undertaken with MDI and TDI to assess dermal uptake and resulting systemic exposure. Absorption, distribution and excretion of MDI was studied in rats using a single dermal administration of (14)C-MDI dissolved in acetone at nominal 165 mg/kg body weight and 15 mg/kg bw (4.0 and 0.4 mg/sq cm) and intradermal injection of (14)C-MDI dissolved in corn oil at nominal 1.4 mg/kg bw. Dermal absorption of (14)C-MDI (at both doses) was low; at or below 1% of the applied dose. Considerable amounts of the applied radioactivity were found at the application site which could not be washed off. By intradermal administration of (14)C-MDI approximately 66% of applied radioactivity remained at the application site with approximately 26% recovered in excreta, cage wash, tissues and carcass. The absorption, distribution and excretion of 2,4-TDI was studied in rats following a single dermal administration of radiolabelled (14)C-2,4-TDI at nominal 350 mg/kg body weight (12 mg/sq cm). Dermal absorption of (14)C-2,4-TDI was at or below 1% of the applied dose. Considerable amounts of the applied radioactivity were found at the application site which could not be washed off. In summary the results show that dermal uptake of MDI and TDI is very low. Due to the chemical reactivity of isocyanates it can be expected that small amounts which might be absorbed will react with tissue constituents directly at the exposed skin area, or will be converted to adducts with biomacromolecules or to biologically inactive oligoureas. Overall it is concluded that, following dermal exposure to MDI and TDI, systemic exposures and resulting toxicity, other than the known sensitization, can be expected to be very low. In addition studies were performed with dermal application of unlabelled 2,4 and 2,6 TDI to check the availability and fate of this chemical on rat skin surface and to assess possible tissue damage. These experiments showed that unchanged test material can be detected on rat skin for up to 8 hr if not washed off. Dermal treatment with 2,4 or 2,6 TDI was associated with irritation with increased severity over a 48 hr period after washing with a decontaminant solution.",

Hemoglobin adducts of these metabolites were also detected. The dose-response relationships for hemoglobin adducts and urinary metabolites were non-linear over this dose range. The amounts of 4,4'-methylenedianiline and, to a lesser extent, N-acetyl-4,4'-methylenedianiline found in urine correlated well with the corresponding amount determined as hemoglobin adducts for all dose groups. Similar results were obtained with rats exposed for three and 12 months, indicating that a steady state had been reached by three months. Hemoglobin adducts from rats after a one-week recovery period decreased by approximately 40% for all dosed groups, suggesting that erythrocytes containing modified hemoglobin have a shorter lifespan.",

Quantification of adducts as toluene diamines (TDAs) and methylenedianiline (MDA) was performed on perfluoroacylated derivatives by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in negative chemical ionisation mode. TDI-derived adducts were found in 77% of plasma and in 59% of globin samples from exposed workers manufacturing flexible polyurethane foam. The plasma levels ranged from 0.003 to 0.58 nmol mL(-1) and those in globin from 0.012 to 0.33 nmol g(-1). The 2,6-isomer amounted to about two-thirds of the sum concentration of TDA isomers. MDI-derived adducts were detected in 3.5% of plasma and in 7% of globin samples from exposed workers manufacturing rigid polyurethane foam. A good correlation was found between the sum of TDA isomers in urine and that in plasma. The relationship between globin adducts and urinary metabolites was ambiguous. Monitoring TDI-derived TDA in plasma thus appears to be an appropriate method for assessing occupational exposure. Contrary to TDI exposure, adducts in plasma or globin were not useful in assessing workers' exposure to MDI. An important outcome of the study was that no amine-related adducts were detected in globin samples from TDI- or MDI-exposed workers, alleviating concerns that TDI or MDI might pose a carcinogenic hazard.",

MDA could be identified in hydrolyzed hemoglobin from 10 of 26 workers exposed to MDI (all but three <0.3 ppb; values for the other three were 1.0, 1.8 and 2.9 ppb). After alkaline extraction there were measurable amounts of acetyl-MDA (AcMDA) and lesser amounts of MDA in urine from 18 of the 26, MDA alone in 4 samples, and neither substance in 4. After acid hydrolysis the MDA levels were on average about 1/3 higher that the total of AcMDA and MDA in the previous analysis. The levels of hemoglobin adducts had no correlation to metabolites in urine. In a polyurethane production facility where air concentrations of MDI were usually below the detection limit, measurable amounts of 4,4'-MDA (0.035-0.83 pmol/mL) and AcMDA (0.13-7.61 pmol/mL) could be found in urine in 15 of 20 workers after alkaline extraction, and MDA values were 6.5 times higher after acid hydrolysis. MDA was found as hemoglobin adducts in all the examined workers, and one worker also had adducts of AcMDA. Plasma levels of 4,4'-MDA ranged from 0.25 to 5.4 pmol/mL, up to 120 fmol/mg of which was covalently bound to albumin.",

MDI has been observed to irritate the skin and eyes of rabbits. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to MDI has been shown to cause asthma, dyspnea, and other respiratory impairments in workers. Respiratory effects have also been observed in animals. No adequate information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of MDI in humans.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The product is used to make rigid and semi-rigid polyurethane foams. Pure MDI is distilled from the reaction mixture and is used for reaction injection molding, thermoplastic elastomers, and adhesives. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: MDI is irritating to skin, eyes, and respiratory passages.  Nose and throat irritation has also been observed. A few cases of alveolitis have been reported in workers exposed to MDI vapors. Contact allergy and allergic contact eczema have been reported in workers exposed to MDI. Cases of asthmatic breathing have been observed in workers.  Lung fibrosis is also been observed in workers exposed to MDI. Children living in proximity of an accidental MDI release had signs of sore throat, dizziness, nausea and breathing difficulties MDI is an allergic sensitizer. Workers in occupational settings have the potential for inhalation or skin contact with particles of MDI.  There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of MDI in humans. ANIMAL STUDIES: There is limited evidence in experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of MDI. MDI has low oral toxicity in rats. Repeated doses of MDI for 5 days in corn oil produced slight spleen enlargement in rats. In male and female rats exposed to polymeric MDI aerosol there was increased incidences of pulmonary adenomas in high dose males.  Accumulation of alveolar macrophages containing polymeric MDI were associated with retractile yellowish material, localized fibrosis and alveolar duct epithelialization and increased alveolar bronchiolization were observed in the lungs of the high dose group. A 2 yr inhalation study using a mixture of MDI and higher weight oligomers showed both male and female rats had treatment related histological changes in the nasal cavity, lungs and lymph nodes. In female rats exposed by inhalation to MDI on days 6-15 of gestation, there was a slight increase in asymmetric sternbrae at the highest dose but no adverse effect was observed on maternal weight gain, number of corpea lutea, implantation sites, pre and post- implantation loss, fetal or placental weight, gross abnormalities or degree of ossification. MDI was tested for mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537 in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. The chemical was negative for mutagenicity. MDI in the micronucleus assay was negative for mutagenicity.",

It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Under U.S. EPA's 1996 Proposed Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment, the carcinogenic potential of MDI/PMDI would be characterized as \"cannot be determined, but for which there is suggestive evidence that raises concern for carcinogenic effects\" on the following basis. The increased incidence of pulmonary adenomas in male (6/60) and female (2/59) Wistar rats [strain Cpu:WU] and one pulmonary adenocarcinoma in a male rat, all exposed to the highest concentration in a lifetime chronic inhalation study involving PMDI, suggest that PMDI has tumorigenic potential. However, the tumorigenic results, coupled with evidence that methylene diphenyl aniline (MDA) a known animal carcinogen and the principal reaction product of MDI, is found in blood of MDI-exposed rats and nonhydrolyzed urine of PMDI/MDI-exposed humans increases concern about the carcinogenic potential of PMDI/MDI. The available human evidence is inadequate to describe the carcinogenic potential of PMDI/MDI. HUMAN CARCINOGENICITY DATA: Inadequate. ANIMAL CARCINOGENICITY DATA: Limited.",

In all cases RAST and/or skin-test investigations revealed the presence of IgE antibodies reacting specifically with HSA conjugated with those isocyanates to which workers were exposed as well as with other isocyanates with which they had not been in contact. By the RAST inhibition technique, moderate to strong mutual cross-reactivities between all tested isocyanate-HSA conjugates--even between aromatic and aliphatic ones--could be demonstrated in tests with five sera. The magnitudes of cross-reactivities differed, however, from one patient to another. One serum contained IgE antibodies that were almost completely specific to TDI-HSA; with this serum only weak cross-reactivities with other isocyanate conjugates could be demonstrated. These results indicate the predominance of closely related antigenic determinants in HSA conjugated with different isocyanates. The common antibody-binding regions are obviously recognized to different extents by antibodies of clinically sensitized workers, indicating individual differences in specificities and avidities of antibody populations. Nearly complete lack of IgE binding of ovalbumin-bound TDI in RAST and RAST inhibition indicates carrier-specific antigenicity of isocyanate-protein conjugates. In addition, since unmodified HSA did not bind IgE, antigenic determinants of the conjugates studied should be predominantly formed by the isocyanate-protein bond regions and concurrently by neighboring amino acid residues of the HSA molecule. /Isocyanates/",

Concentrations varied from 0.12 to 12.7 mg/cu m using a highly respirable aerosol. In regard to the concentration of the monomeric fraction of MDI contained in pMDI, the lowest concentration was in the range of the current workplace limit of MDI which is 0.05 mg/cu m. Biomarkers of exposure were determined in hydrolyzed urine (collection started after cessation of exposure for approximately 18 hr; acid hydrolysis) and hydrolyzed hemoglobin (collection of blood approximately 20 hr after cessation of exposure; alkaline hydrolysis). The determination revealed two-order of magnitudes higher yields of the biomarkers in urine when compared to hemoglobin. The concentration of analytes from the respective biological matrix was highly correlated with the airborne concentration of pMDI whilst their yields exhibited a reciprocal relationship to the airborne concentration of pMDI. A linear relationship could only be demonstrated by using a logarithmic transformation of data. With respect to the amount of 4,4'-methylenediphenyldianiline creatinine (MDA/g creatinine) in hydrolyzed urine of rats at an exposure level similar to the current workplace concentration of MDI, this marker of exposure was approximately 10-times lower in rats than predicted for humans. This suggests that the extrapolation of animal data to man as well as from one exposure regimen to another, without taking into consideration the different deposition/retention patterns of vapors (<or=0.05 mg/cu m) or aerosols of MDI, might be error prone. In summary, taking into account previous and current experimental evidence, these data substantiate further that the formation of MDI-related biomarkers appear to be governed by spontaneously occurring, scavenging reactions at the portal-of-entry. Comparison of MDI with its corresponding amine support that the analytes determined stem from conjugated MDI rather than in vivo hydrolyzed MDI.",

The types of polyisocyanates examined included aliphatic homopolymers and mixed aliphatic-aromatic polyisocyanates consisting of the following monomers: HDI (hexamethylene 1,6-diisocyanate), IPDI (isophorone diisocyanate), MDI (methylene-diphenyl-4,4'-diisocyanate) and TDI (toluene diisocyanate). For reference purposes, the pulmonary irritant polyisocyanate aerosols were compared with monomeric IPDI, a semi-volatile respiratory tract (airway) irritant. In the substances tested, the concentration of free isocyanate moieties ranged from 11% to 38%. The relative potency to elicit pulmonary irritation was assessed by measurements of lung weights and total protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) following a single 6-hr exposure of male rats. The time course of changes was analysed 3 hr and 1, 3 and 7 days after exposure. When exposed to irritant concentrations of aerosol, BALF protein was maximal on post-exposure day 1 and returned to the level of the controls on post-exposure day 7. In contrast, rats exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of monomeric IPDI experienced a time-related increase in BALF protein. Based on this most sensitive endpoint, extrapolated no-observed-effect concentrations (NOECs) were in the range of 2-3 mg /per/ cu m for most polyisocyanates examined. The NOECs from all the substances investigated were in the range 1-50 mg /per/ cu m. Thus, this methodology is adequate to rank the pulmonary irritant potency of polyisocyanate aerosols and to differentiate pulmonary from airway irritants. For pulmonary irritants the estimated acute NOECs were essentially similar to the no-observed-adverse effect concentrations (NOAECs) from long-term, repeated-exposure inhalation studies available for some of the polyisocyanates. A clear dependence of the NOAECs on the content of free isocyanate moieties was not observed. In summary, it is concluded that pulmonary irritation caused by polyisocyanate aerosols can be quantified readily in an acute rat bioassay by analysis of total protein in BALF. Moreover, this experimental evidence suggests that the NOECs of pulmonary irritants based on this endpoint are predictive of the NOAECs observed after subacute/subchronic inhalation exposure, suggesting that acute pulmonary irritation governs the outcome of repeated inhalation studies with such aerosols. However, for isocyanates where airway irritation predominates the pulmonary irritation, long(er)-term inhalation studies appear to be indispensable. The content of free NCO per se appears to be a poor predictor of the pulmonary irritant potency of polyisocyanate aerosols.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.0X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate will be  degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hrs. Particulate-phase 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 4,4'-Methylenediphenyl diisocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to water or moist soil, 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate is not expected to leach or adsorb to solids due to its rapid hydrolysis. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. Since 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate reacts with water to form amines and urea, accumulation in the food chain should be low or non-existent. Occupational exposure to 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate occurs through inhalation of vapors and aerosols and through dermal contact with this compound and other compounds containing 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate via inhalation and dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Reaction with atmospheric water vapor(4) may increase the atmospheric degradation rate several fold(SRC). Particulate-phase 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition(SRC). 4,4'-Methylenediphenyl diisocyanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5), and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Based on available data and analogy to other isocyanates, the hydrolysis half-life is on the order of a few minutes to a few hours(5). Reaction with water is complex and usually involves several mechanisms(1); an initial unstable intermediate (acid) is formed that decomposes to the amine with liberation of carbon dioxide, and the amine can react with more 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate to form a polyurea(1). Atmospheric chamber studies with the similar compound TDI (toluene diisocyanate) have shown that vapor-phase degradation increased from 15% to about 20% per hour as a result of OH radical attack(6); the 15% per hour rate occurred in the dark (no hydroxyl radical) with a relative humidity of 7-70%(6); therefore, reaction with water vapor in air may be more important than OH radical reaction for 4,4'-methylenediphenyl diisocyanate but this could also be a surface reaction in the chamber(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

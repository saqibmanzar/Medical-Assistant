PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.0X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine will exist solely in the vapor-phase. Vapor-phase N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. N,N-Diethyl-p-phenylenediamine absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum and has the potential for direct photolysis. If released to soil, N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 470. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. The pKa of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine is 7.96, indicating that this compound will exist in the cation form. Cations generally adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because the cation is not expected to volatilize. If released into water, N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The general population may be exposed to N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine via dermal contact with this compound and consumer products containing N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(4), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

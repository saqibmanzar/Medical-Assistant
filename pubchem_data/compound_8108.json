PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For the analysis of solid waste, a representative sample (solid or liquid) is collected in a standard 40 ml glass screw-cap VOA vial equipped with a Teflon-faced silicone septum. Sample agitation, as well as contamination of the collected sample with air, must be avoided. Two VOA vials are filled per sample location, then placed in separate plastic bags for shipment and storage. Samples can be analyzed by direct injection or purge-and trap gas chromatography. A temperature program is used in the gas chromatograph to separate the organic compounds. Column 1 is an 8-ft by 0.1-in I.D. stainless steel or glass column packed with 1% SP-1000 on Carbopack-B 60/80 mesh or equivalent. Column 2 is a 6-ft by 0.1-in I.D. stainless steel or glass column packed with n-octane on Porasil-C 100/120 mesh (Durapak) or equivalent. Detection is achieved by a flame ionization detector (FID).

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Mice pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine were sensitive to the potential toxicity of 4-Nitrophenyl vinyl ether. These results showed that aryl vinyl ethers, 4-Nitrophenyl vinyl ether and phenyl vinyl ether, are more toxic than the alkyl vinyl ether, n-Butyl vinyl ether, and that glutathione plays an important role on the protection of hepatic injury by reactive metabolite(s) derived from vinyl ethers.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 49 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates butyl vinyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase butyl vinyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours. The vapor phase reactions of butyl vinyl ether with photochemically produced ozone corresponds to a half-life of 6.5 days. Direct photolysis will not be an important removal process since aliphatic ethers do not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm. If released to soil, butyl vinyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 53. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may be important given the vapor pressure of this compound. If released into water, butyl vinyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based on its estimated Henry's Law constant. The volatilization half-life from a model river and a model lake is estimated as approximately 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Limited data are present in the scientific literature regarding the biodegradation of butyl vinyl ether. Butyl vinyl ether will be susceptible to appreciable hydrolysis in certain environmental waters, especially at acidic pH, with calculated half-lives for hydrolysis of 9.5 hr, 40 days, and 10.9 yr at pH 5, 7, and 9, respectively. The most probable route of general population exposure to butyl vinyl ether is via inhalation of contaminated air. Exposure through dermal contact may occur in occupational settings. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase butyl vinyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours(3,SRC). Butyl vinyl ether may be susceptible to photooxidation via vapor phase reaction with ozone; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.5 days(4,SRC). Direct photolysis will not be an important removal process since butyl vinyl ether does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

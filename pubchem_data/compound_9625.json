For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Patients must be removed from the exposure environment, and high-flow supplemental oxygen should be utilized.

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin and countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40 to 42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb and standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation and slit-lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

A 43 year old male was found to have a serum creatine-kinase activity of 650 international units per liter, normal range 10 to 200 international units/liter, suggesting that he was susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. He was tested because his daughter had experienced an episode of malignant hyperthermia during general anesthesia. His susceptibility was confirmed by in vitro testing of a muscle specimen with halothane and caffeine. The subject was subsequently employed in a factory that made fire extinguishers where one of his jobs consisted of discharging bromochlorodifluoromethane from fire extinguishers before refilling them. Although discharging was done in open air, some gas was commonly inhaled. Eighteen months after beginning this work, he was examined for complaints of malaise and stiffness and weakness in the forearms and hands. The symptoms progressively worsened during the week and improved the weekends. Serum creatine-kinase activity was 1056 IU/l on one Saturday and 544 IU/l the following Monday. Because of the similarity in structure between bromochlorodifluoromethane and halothane, the effects of the former on contractions of a muscle specimen were examined. Bromochlorodifluoromethane induced contractions identical to those of halothane. The patient was advised to change jobs. After he did so his symptoms immediately improved. It was concluded that the patient's rhabdomyolysis is due to recurring exposures to bromochlorodifluoromethane. They recommended that persons susceptible to malignant hyperthermia avoid exposure to similar halogenated hydrocarbons.",

Ten men, recruited from an ongoing screening program for firefighters, were exposed to 1000 ppm Halon-1211 or a placebo by a mask inhalation system during three 10 to 16 minute exercise protocols and their 5 minute rest periods. Measurements of carboxyhemoglobin and serum potassium levels were taken before the exposure sessions. The subjects completed a questionnaire pertaining to caffeine, alcohol, and cigarette consumption. Ventricular ectopy rates during exercise and recovery were low. Six of the ten subjects demonstrated two or fewer total ventricular premature beats during the exposure period and subsequent 8 hours during both halon and placebo sessions. Two subjects displayed increased ventricular ectopy during halon exposure but two had decreased ectopy rates. All subjects demonstrated an increase in blood pressure in response to the exercise protocol; eight of ten subjects exhibited a smaller elevation in systolic blood pressure during halon exposure. No significant differences were noted in arrhythmia or blood pressure effects in the first exposure compared with the second exposure. There was no evidence of a carry over effect. Blood pressure and measures of ectopy were not linked to recent fire fighting exposures, age, smoking status, resting blood pressure, potassium level, or carboxyhemoglobin levels. /It was/ concluded that currently permissible occupational exposures to halogenated hydrocarbons may increase cardiac arrhythmias in susceptible individuals.",

Two Israeli soldiers serving as gunner and driver inside a battle tank extinguished a small fire ignited by an electrical short circuit 1.36 kg portable fire extinguishers containing bromochlorofluoromethane. Within a few seconds of releasing the contents of the fire extinguishers both soldiers experienced dizziness and shortness of breath. The gunner who was seated at the turret immediately left the tank and his symptoms disappeared within 60 seconds. A physical examination revealed no abnormalities. Blood samples analyzed 20 hours after the accident showed no methemoglobin, cyanide or bromochlorofluoromethane. The driver was unable to extricate himself from the tank and could not inhale fresh air since his compartment was isolated by closed hatches. He was taken out unconscious with no pulse or spontaneous breathing a few minutes after the fire was extinguished. He died within 2 hours despite intensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts. Brain edema with heavy congestion were seen at autopsy. The alveoli were suffused with heavy blood fluid. His blood contained 0.7% methemoglobin. Bromochlorofluoromethane was detected. No cyanide or carboxyhemoglobin was observed. A simulation experiment in an identical tank using the same type of fire extinguishers indicated that bromochlorofluoromethane concentrations reached 1.9% in the driver's compartment within one minute and 5.8% in the turret within 30 seconds. The concentrations gradually decreased to 0 over the next 5 minutes. /It was/ concluded that all personnel should be evacuated to the open air before bromochlorofluoromethane is used.",

Pregnant female rats were exposed by inhalation to 1000, 10,000, or 50,000 ppm bromochlorodifluoromethane for six hours a day on days six to 15 of gestation (day of mating = day 0). Exposure to 50,000 ppm bromochlorodifluoromethane caused a reduction in maternal weight gain over the exposure period but there was no evidence of either teratogenicity or embryo/ fetotoxicity at any concentration. In a study designed to assess the potential effect of bromochlorodifluoromethane during a complete reproductive cycle male and female rats were exposed to 5000 ppm or 25,000 ppm bromochlorodifluoromethane for six hours a day for five days a week for 10 weeks (males) or three weeks (females) before mating. Exposure to bromochlorodifluoromethane continued during mating and up to day 20 of gestation for half the females which were subsequently allowed to litter and the development of their offspring monitored. The remaining females were removed from exposure to bromochlorodifluoromethane after mating and killed on day 20 of gestation for examination of their uterine contents. There were no effects on adult fertility, pup numbers, survival, or pup development.",

Hearts were perfused through the aorta. Left ventricular mechanical activity was monitored concurrently with action potentials recorded from left ventricular myocardial fibers. In the first series, mechanical performance curves were determined for each of 7 hearts using intraventricular balloons to control end diastolic pressure. The relative effectiveness of these compounds as negative inotropic agents was bromochlorodifluoromethane > dichlorodifluoromethane > bromotrifluoromethane. In the 2nd series of experiments, hearts were exposed to increasing concentrations of each fluorocarbon. Controls were exposed to equivalent concentrations of nitrogen. Exposure to increasing concentrations of bromotrifluoromethane decreased peak left ventricular pressure, the integral of the pressure curve, and the time to 20% repolarization of the action potential. Exposure to increasing concentrations of bromochlorodifluoromethane reduced peak left ventricular pressure and the maximal rate of rise of the pressure curve ... Exposure to increasing levels of dichlorodifluoromethane decreased peak left ventricular pressure and the maximal rate of rise of the pressure curve.",

However, the production of bromochlorodifluoromethane has to be stopped in accordance with the Montreal Protocol of 1987 as it plays an important role in the destruction of the earth's ozone layer. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.07X10+3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bromochlorodifluoromethane will exist solely in the gas phase in the ambient atmosphere. Gas phase bromochlorodifluoromethane will slowly be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 44 years. Bromochlorodifluoromethane absorbs very little UV radiation above 290 nm and is not expected to photolyze at a significant rate in the ambient atmosphere. Since bromochlorodifluoromethane exists as a gas, it is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.4X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Bromochlorodifluoromethane will volatilize rapidly from dry soil surfaces since it exists as a gas in the ambient environment. If released into water, bromochlorodifluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.3 hrs and 5.1 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5.8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Given its high degree of halogenation, it is not expected to be an important degradation pathway for bromochlorodifluoromethane. Occupational exposure to bromochlorodifluoromethane may occur through inhalation of this compound at workplaces where bromochlorodifluoromethane is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to bromochlorodifluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air and use of portable fire extinguisher products containing bromochlorodifluoromethane. Bromochlorodifluoromethane is widely detected in the atmosphere. (SRC)",

Gas-phase bromochlorodifluoromethane is slowly degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 44 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of <1.0X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Bromochlorodifluoromethane absorbs very little UV radiation above 290 nm(4). In the troposphere, it has an estimated photolysis half-life of 12.4 years(4). Therefore, photolysis is not expected to be a significant degradation pathway for bromochlorodifluoromethane in the troposphere(SRC). The stratospheric half-life of bromochlorodifluoromethane has been estimated to range from 20 to 29 years with direct photolysis being the dominant removal mechanism(5). Therefore, when bromochlorodifluoromethane is released into the atmosphere, it will diffuse gradually into the upper limits of the troposhere, and eventually, into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will degrade slowly via photolysis(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of greater than 44 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). In general, polyhalomethane compounds undergo hydrolysis with highly substituted halo compounds hydrolyzing more slowly than lower substituted halo compounds(3). Therefore, although hydrolysis may occur it is not expected to be an important degradation pathway for bromochlorodifluoromethane(3). Bromochlorodifluoromethane absorbs very little UV radiation above 290 nm(4). In the troposphere, it has an estimated photolysis half-life of 12.4 yrs(4). Therefore, photolysis is not expected to be a significant degradation pathway for bromochlorodifluoromethane in the ambient troposphere(SRC). In the stratosphere, the half-life of bromochlorodifluoromethane has been estimated to range from 20 to 29 years with direct photolysis being the dominant removal mechanism(5). Stratospheric ozone is depleted by halogenated compounds (including bromochlorodifluoromethane) through the reaction of the halogen atoms with ozone. As bromochlorodifluoromethane degrades, halogens enter the atmosphere and can degrade ozone in such a way that the halogen atom is recycled while the ozone molecules are constantly broken down to oxygen(6). By this process, the existence of one halogen atom can have a devastating effect on the concentration of ozone in the strosphere. Bromochlorodifluoromethane has been assigned an Ozone Depleting Potential(ODP) of 3(7). The term ODP refers to the relative ozone depletion potential of a compound compared to that of CFC-11, which is arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.0.(8). It is the numerical quantity describing the extent of ozone depletion calculated to arise from the release to the atmosphere of 1 kg of a compound relative to the ozone depletion calculated to arise from a similar release of CFC-11(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

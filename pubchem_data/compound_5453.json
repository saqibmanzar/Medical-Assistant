For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

For controlling intracavitary effusions secondary to diffuse or localized neoplastic diseases of various serosal cavities. 4. For the treatment of superficial papillary carcinoma of the urinary bladder.  While now largely superseded by other treatments, thiotepa has been effective against other lymphomas, such as lymphosarcoma and Hodgkin's disease. /Included in US product label/",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Although TEPA is the only metabolite detected and identified in plasma, there is evidence that other unidentified metabolites also are formed. Following rapid IV injection of thiotepa in adults with normal renal and hepatic function, plasma concentrations of the drug appear to decline in a biphasic manner with a half-life of approximately 6-12 minutes in the initial phase and 1.2-2.9 hours in the terminal phase. The plasma elimination half-life of TEPA is about 10-21 hours.",

The thioTEPA dose was 40 or 60 mg/sq m in short infusions, twice daily, during 4 days. Urine samples were collected after each voiding on each day of drug administration until 24-48 h after the last thioTEPA infusion. ThioTEPA, TEPA and monochloroTEPA concentrations were determined with gas chromatography and thioTEPA--mercapturate with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with direct sample injection. ThioTEPA was present in urine 30 min after infusion and was still excreted 18 hr after the last infusion. All metabolites were detected in urine 1 hr after infusion. Patients with a creatinine clearance above 140 ml/minl showed higher excretion of TEPA than patients with a creatinine clearance below 140 mL/min (12.8 versus 4.9%, p=0.01). The excretion of monochloroTEPA relative to the excreted amount of TEPA increased at lower pH values of the urine. The excretion of thioTEPA--mercapturate relative to the dose was higher in patients treated with 60 mg/sq m. Excretion of thioTEPA and monochloroTEPA both accounted for only 0.5% of the dose, while TEPA and thioTEPA--mercapturate both accounted for 11.1%.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The blood platelet number, platelet production (measured by (35)S incorporation into platelets), mean platelet volume, and the number and DNA content of bone marrow megakaryocytes were observed. The blood platelet counts, platelet production, and total megakaryocytes number decreased to low values following the administration of thio-tepa, and stayed low until regeneration started around day 10. The mean platelet volume increased from the normal 6.6 fL to 7.8 fL during the early regeneration days 8-14. The megakaryocytes were divided into four ploidy classes: 2N-4N, 8N, 16N, and 32N-64N. The number of megakaryocytes within all ploidy classes decreased to nearly zero within four days after the injection of thio-tepa. The regeneratin started around day 10 with increasing numbers of 2N-4N and 8N megakaryocytes, while the number of 16N and 32N-64N megakaryocytes increased more than four days later.

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Thiotepa is known to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence from studies in humans. The major adverse effect of thiotepa is hematologic toxicity, which is usually dose related and cumulative. Adverse hematopoietic effects include leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia which is sometimes fatal. Hematologic status must be carefully monitored in patients receiving thiotepa. Although the leukocyte nadir may occur at 10-14 days when thiotepa is given once weekly IV, initial effects on bone marrow may not be evident for up to 30 days. Because of absorption through serous membranes, intracavitary and intravesical instillation of thiotepa can produce systemic adverse effects of varying severity; and deaths resulting from bone marrow depression secondary to systemic absorption of the drug, have occurred following intravesical instillation of the drug. ln high-dose therapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation, central nervous system disturbances, hepatic damage, infections, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, skin rashes, hemorrhagic cystitis and cardiomyopathy may be severe. Hematopoietic toxicity can occur following overdose, manifested by a decrease in the white cell count and/or platelets. Red blood cell count is a less accurate indicator of thiotepa toxicity. Bleeding manifestations may develop. The patient may become more vulnerable to infection, and less able to combat such infection.  Dosages within and minimally above the recommended therapeutic doses have been associated with potentially life-threatening hematopoietic toxicity. Thiotepa has a toxic effect on the hematopoietic system that is dose related. Treatment with thiotepa of cultured human lymphocytes resulted in significant increase in frequency of chromosome aberrations. Thiotepa can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ANIMAL STUDIES: Intravitreal injection of thiotepa in rabbits at a concentration of 8 mg/mL has been reported to be tolerated without excessive inflammation or alteration of the electroretinogram. Weanling rats treated with 1:445 or 1:1000 thiotepa eyedrops during six weeks have developed corneal vascularization and cataract. Thiotepa was administered to rats at 1 mg/kg bw once weekly for 52 weeks. Malignant tumors developed in 30% treated animals; in controls, malignant tumors were found in 6% animals. Thiotepa was teratogenic in pregnant mice injected intraperitoneally with single doses of 0.5-30 mg/kg bw on various days of gestation. The minimum teratogenic dose was 1 mg/kg bw; after administration of 10 mg/kg bw all fetuses were malformed. After rats were given 5 mg/kg bw thiotepa, gross developmental abnormalities and skeletal defects were observed in fetuses. Thiotepa interfered with spermatogenesis in hamsters and mice. Thiotepa induced dominant lethal mutations, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges in rodents treated in vivo. It induced sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in rodent cells in vitro. It was mutagenic to Chinese hamster cells in vitro and to mouse lymphoma cells in a host-mediated assay. Thiotepa induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila, caused sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in plant cells and was mutagenic to fungi and to bacteria in vitro and in host-mediated assays.",

The pattern of serum enzyme elevations is usually hepatocellular, with marked increases in serum aminotransferase and lactic dehydrogenase levels and minimal increase in alkaline phosphatase. In severe instances, there are elevations in prothrombin time and progressive hepatic failure. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are uncommon. The fatality rate is high.

However, when vitamin C was tested at 0.02 mM and 0.2 mM a rather protective effect on sister chromatid exchange rates induced by thiotepa or L-ethionine was identified. Vitamin C (2 mM) caused a cell division delay in cultures treated with thiotepa or L-ethionine. Division delays caused by thiotepa or L-ethionine were reversed in the presence of 0.02 mM or 0.2 mM vitamin C. Mitotic indices in cultures treated with thiotepa or L-ethionine continued to be suppressed in the presence of 2 mM vitamin C. However, vitamin C at 0.02 mM reversed suppression of mitotic indices caused by L-ethionine or thiotepa. These findings illustrate the complexity of the interactions of vitamin C in biological systems and indicate that with different concentrations vitamin C can cause or prevent genetic toxicity.",

Adverse hematopoietic effects include leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia which is sometimes fatal. Hematologic status must be carefully monitored in patients receiving thiotepa. Although the leukocyte nadir may occur at 10-14 days when thiotepa is given once weekly IV, initial effects on bone marrow may not be evident for up to 30 days. Because of absorption through serous membranes, intracavitary and intravesical instillation of thiotepa can produce systemic adverse effects of varying severity, and deaths resulting from bone marrow depression secondary to systemic absorption of the drug, have occurred following intravesical instillation of the drug.",

Groups of 31-39 rats of each sex were admin thio-TEPA in phosphate buffered saline at one of three doses, either 0.7, 1.4 or 2.8 mg/kg body weight, three times per wk for a maximum of 52 wk, then observed for an additional periods of time. The maximum time on study (admin of chemical and observation) was 86 wk. The groups at the low dose were started 69 wk after those at the mid and high doses, because of high mortalities observed in the groups at the higher doses. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated rats and 10 vehicle control rats of each sex. Pooled control groups were also used. Surviving control rats were /sacrificed/ at 82-87 wk; surviving dosed rats were /sacrificed/ at 81 or 82 wk. Groups of 35 mice of each sex were admin thio-TEPA at one of two doses 1.15 or 2.3 mg/kg body wt, three times per wk for a maximum of 52 wk, then observed for a maximum additional period of 34 wk. Matched controls consisted of groups of 15 untreated mice and 15 vehicle control mice of each sex. Pooled controls also were used. Surviving control and dosed mice were /sacrificed/ at 86 or 87 wk. Thio-TEPA was toxic to both rats and mice, causing decr mean body wt gains and early deaths in the mid and high dose rats and in the high dose mice. Because of early deaths, statistical analyses were based only on time adjusted incidences of tumors. Since all high dose male and female rats died by 21 wk, microscopic evaluation of tissues was performed only on the low and mid dose animals. ... It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, thio-TEPA was carcinogenic in both Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F1 mice. In the rats, the chemical induced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or ear canal in both males and females, and hematopoietic neoplasms in the males; in the mice, it induced lymphoma or lymphocytic leukemia in both sexes and squamous cell carcinoma in the skin and associated glands of males.

Thiotepa is metabolized by cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase enzymes. Polymorphisms of these enzymes may affect elimination of thiotepa and tepa, its main metabolite. The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of known allelic variants in CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GSTA1 and GSTP1 genes on pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa. White patients (n = 124) received a high-dose regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa and carboplatin as intravenous infusions. Genomic DNA was analysed using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Plasma concentrations of thiotepa and tepa were determined using validated GC and LC-MS/MS methods. Relations between allelic variants and elimination pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (nonmem). RESULTS: The polymorphisms CYP2B6 C1459T, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3, GSTA1 (C-69T, G-52A) and GSTP1 C341T had a significant effect on clearance of thiotepa or tepa. Although significant, most effects were generally not large. Clearance of thiotepa and tepa was predominantly affected by GSTP1 C341T polymorphism, which had a frequency of 9.3%. This polymorphism increased non-inducible thiotepa clearance by 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 41, 64, P < 0.001] and decreased tepa clearance by 32% (95% CI 29, 35, P < 0.001) in heterozygous patients, which resulted in an increase in combined exposure to thiotepa and tepa of 45% in homozygous patients. This study indicates that the presently evaluated variant alleles explain only a small part of the substantial interindividual variability in thiotepa and tepa pharmacokinetics. Patients homozygous for the GSTP1 C341T allele may have enhanced exposure to thiotepa and tepa.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.4X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates thiotepa will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase thiotepa will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.2 days. Thiotepa does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, thiotepa is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Thiotepa is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, thiotepa is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis does not occur in dilute solutions but at higher concentrations, aziridinyl phosphoramides are formed. Occupational exposure to thiotepa may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where thiotepa is produced or used. The general public is not likely to be exposed to thiotepa unless by direct medical treatment. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

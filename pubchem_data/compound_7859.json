For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Approximately 60% of the dose was excreted in the urine by 96 hr. Major metabolites were identified in the urine by 1- and 2-D NMR and confirmed by isolation and purification of the individual metabolites followed by (13)C FT-NMR and mass spectometry. The proposed pathway involves oxidation of propargyl alcohol to 2-propynoic acid and glutathione conjugation, the first example of multiple glutathione additions to a triple bond. The following final products were identified: 3-((2-(acetylamino)-2-carboxyethyl)thio)-2-propenoic acid, S-S-(3-hydroxypropylidene)-bis(N-acetylcysteine), and 3-((2-(acetylamino)-2-carboxyethyl)-sulfinyl)-3-((2-(acetylamino)-2-carboxyethyl)thio)1-propanol.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The vapors tested included chloroform, benzene, epichlorohydrin, acrylonitrile, propargyl alcohol, 1,2-dibromoethane, acrolein, chloromethyl-methyl-ether, and N-nitrosodimethylamine. The challenge concentration was 50 times the assigned TLV or 50 times the lowest practical concentration where no TLV was assigned. A flow rate through the canisters corresponding to 49 standard l/min was used. Tests were conducted at relative humidities of 80% and less than 15%, and all tests continued for 16 hr or until 1% penetration or half the TLV was detected downstream of the canisters. A moderate breathing rate was assumed. The canister, under the experimental conditions, afforded adequate worker protection against chloroform, benzene, and acrylonitrile for a minimum of 4 hr and epichlorohydrin for at least 8 hr. The canister provided adequate worker protection for propargyl alcohol, 1,2-dibromoethane, and acrolein for a minimum of 16 hr. Sixteen hour protection was also adequate for N-nitrosodimethylamine at the 1 ppm challenge level. It is recommended that the canister not be used in a chloromethyl-methyl-ether environment.",

Acetyl bromide reacts violently with alcohols or water [Merck 11th ed. 1989]. Mixtures of alcohols with concentrated sulfuric acid and strong hydrogen peroxide can cause explosions. Example: An explosion will occur if dimethylbenzylcarbinol is added to 90% hydrogen peroxide then acidified with concentrated sulfuric acid. Mixtures of ethyl alcohol with concentrated hydrogen peroxide form powerful explosives. Mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and 1-phenyl-2-methyl propyl alcohol tend to explode if acidified with 70% sulfuric acid [Chem. Eng. News 45(43):73 1967]; [J. Org. Chem. 28:1893 1963]. Alkyl hypochlorites are violently explosive. They are readily obtained by reacting hypochlorous acid and alcohols either in aqueous solution or mixed aqueous-carbon tetrachloride solutions. Chlorine plus alcohols would similarly yield alkyl hypochlorites. They decompose in the cold and explode on exposure to sunlight or heat. Tertiary hypochlorites are less unstable than secondary or primary hypochlorites [NFPA 491 M 1991]. Base-catalysed reactions of isocyanates with alcohols should be carried out in inert solvents. Such reactions in the absence of solvents often occur with explosive violence [Wischmeyer 1969].",

Hydroxyacetone was being prepared on half the scale by treating propargyl alcohol as a 30% aq soln with mercury sulfate and sulfuric acid (6 g and 0.6 g/mol of alcohol, respectively). On stirring and warming the mixture to 70 \u00b0C a violent exothermic eruption occurred. Quartering the scale of operations to 1 g/mol and reducing the amount of acid to 0.37 g/mol gave a controllable reaction at 70 \u00b0C. Adding the alcohol to the other reactants at 70 \u00b0C is an alternative possibility to avoid the suspected protonation and polymerization of the propargyl alcohol.",

Its former use as a soil fumigant would have resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 15.6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propargyl alcohol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase propargyl alcohol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 hours. Propargyl alcohol can also be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone; however, the rate of this reaction is too slow to be environmentally relevant. Propargyl alcohol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, propargyl alcohol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 14. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Propargyl alcohol may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its extrapolated vapor pressure. The biodegradation half-life of propargyl alcohol was 12.6 and 13 days in an alkaline sandy silt loam from Texas and an acidic sandy loam from Mississippi, respectively. If released into water, propargyl alcohol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 176 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to propargyl alcohol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propargyl alcohol is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its extrapolated vapor pressure, 15.6 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 1X10+6 mg/L (miscible) (5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 176 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation in aerobic water may occur for propargyl alcohol based on biodegradation half-lives of 12.6 and 13 days in two soils(8). In addition, propargyl alcohol achieved 95% of its theoretical BOD in a screening study using an activated sludge inoculum(9), suggesting this compound will degrade under aerobic condictions.",

Vapor-phase propargyl alcohol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C (SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Propargyl alcohol is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone; however, the half-life of this reaction is long compared to the reaction with hydroxyl radicals and is not environmentally relevant(SRC). The half-life for this reaction in air is estimated as 380 days from its theoretical rate constant of 3X10-20 cu cm/molecule-sec(SRC), that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Propargyl alcohol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to/may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

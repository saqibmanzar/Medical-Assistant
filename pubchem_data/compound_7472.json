When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A direct reaction occurred between DMPD and oxyhemoglobin under the formation of ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin) and the N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine radical cation (DMPP.+). Quinonediimine could not be excluded as the ultimate ferrihemoglobin forming oxidant. Addition of excess DMPD shifted the reaction towards the radical side, increasing ferrihemoglobin formation. This showed that the radical was the responsible oxidant. Reactions with glutathione occurred predominantly with the quinonediimine. In corresponding reactions with N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine radical cation, the disproportionation reaction of DMPD.+ was very fast. The formation of glutathione disulfide was negligible. Two isomeric glutathione adducts represented the main reaction products. DMPD in human erythrocytes produced many equivalents of ferrihemoglobin, diminished glutathione, and produced both thioethers. DMPD and glutathione disappearance as well as thioether appearance occurred only after a marked lag phase. At increasing concentrations of ferrihemoglobin, higher steady state concentrations of the radical were attained. Preformed ferrihemoglobin in red cells accelerated DMPD and glutathione disappearance significantly; ferrihemoglobin complexing cyanide completely prevented this effect. The authors emphasize the metabolic competency of blood for the biotransformation of aromatic amines.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

It is used in microscopy, as a reagent in some chemical and biochemical tests, as a base for production of methylene blue, and as a photodeveloper. It is also used in laboratories to screen bacterial culture plates for Neisseria gonorrheae. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine is a severe skin irritant. There have been occasional reports of positive patch tests. In human erythrocytes it produced ferrihemoglobin (methemoglobin), diminished glutathione, and thioethers. ANIMAL STUDIES: Studies on the carcinogenic activity of N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine in rats gave  no indications that the substance has carcinogenic potential. The substance was shown to be a severe skin irritant in the rabbit and caused systemic toxicity after absorption through the skin. Subcutaneous injection of N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine at 25 mg/100 g in rats produced focal necrosis and  myofibrillar contracture in skeletal muscles. In the red muscle fibers, band-shaped injury foci accompanied by rapid and intensive plasma cell infiltration was observed. In the white muscle fibers, nodular foci were accompanied by slow, mild plasma cell infiltration. N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine is not embryotoxic, fetotoxic or teratogenic in rats. It was positive in bacterial mutagenicity assay with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98 with or without activation, and in vitro in CHO cell cytogenetics-sister chromatid exchange assay with or without activation. It was negative  in vitro in CHO cell cytogenetics-chromosome aberrations assay with or without activation. Phenolic metabolites and a nitrosamine have been found in the urine and the feces following the oral administration of N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine to rats.",

Dyes were administered by gavage to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats on gestation Days 6 through 15 at doses ranging from 12.5 to 500 mg/kg. No overt signs of toxicity were observed during the treatment period. A significant reduction in mean maternal weight gain was noted during the treatment period at the high dose for 4,4'-diaminodiphenylene sulfate, N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-nitro-O-phenylenediamine, and 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene. The high dose for N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and resorcinol, which exceeded a 100-fold exaggeration of human exposure, did not produce a significant reduction in maternal weight gain. An evaluation of fetal external, visceral, and skeletal anomalies revealed no statistically significant differences between dye-treated and vehicle control groups. Administration of 100,000 units of vitamin A, the positive control, on Day 9 of gestation resulted in a significant increase in abnormal fetuses.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.9X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates N,N-dimethyl-p-benzenediamine will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase N,N-dimethyl-p-benzenediamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, N,N-dimethyl-p-benzenediamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 38. The pKa of N,N-dimethyl-p-benzenediamine is 6.59, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group; therefore, mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, N,N-dimethyl-p-benzenediamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. N,N-Dimethyl-p-benzenediamine in the water column may be susceptible to photo-oxidation via hydroxyl and peroxy radicals; half-lives for these photo-oxidations may be on the order of 19-30 sunlight hours. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to N,N-dimethyl-p-benzenediamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where N,N-dimethyl-p-benzenediamine is produced or used.

Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

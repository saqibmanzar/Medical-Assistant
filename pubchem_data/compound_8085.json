When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.27 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diisobutylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase diisobutylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. If released to soil, diisobutylamine is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 640. The pKa of diisobutylamine is 10.91, indicating that this compound will exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because the cation is not expected to volatilize. Diisobutylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. 63 to 87% of the theoretical BOD was achieved for diisobutylamine using activated sludges over a 4 week incubation period. If released into water, diisobutylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since this compound is expected to exist in the protonated form at environmental pH. An estimated BCF of 21 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to diisobutylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diisobutylamine is produced or used. (SRC)",

A pKa value of 10.91(4) indicates that the protonated form of diisobutylamine will be the dominant species in moist soil surfaces and cations generally adsorb strongly to soils. Volatilization of diisobutylamine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since the cation will not volatilize. Diisobutylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 7.27 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). 63 to 87% of the theoretical BOD was achieved for diisobutylamine using activated sludges over a 4 week incubation period(6), which suggests that biodegradation in soil is expected to be important(SRC).",

A pKa value of 10.91(4) indicates that the protonated form of diisobutylamine will be the predominant species in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) since the protonated form will not volatilize. According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 21(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). 63 to 87% of the theoretical BOD was achieved for diisobutylamine using activated sludges over a 4 week incubation period(7), which suggests that biodegradation in water is expected to be important(SRC).",

Vapor-phase diisobutylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours(SRC), from its rate constant of 9X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Diisobutylamine is not expected to directly photolyze due to the lack of absorption in the environmental UV spectrum(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

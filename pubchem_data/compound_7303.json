The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In-vitro, no ethylene-carbonate hydrolysis occurred. Male Fischer-344-rats were given 200 mg/kg (14)C labeled ethylene-carbonate or 141 mg/kg radiolabeled ethylene-glycol by gavage. In-vivo, ethylene-carbonate was rapidly metabolized, 60 percent of the dose being recovered as carbon-dioxide in the expired air and 27 percent in the urine after 3 hours. Approximately 90 percent of the ethylene-glycol dose was excreted in the expired air or urine after 24 hours. Ethylene-glycol was the only ethylene-carbonate metabolite detected. Peak blood ethylene-carbonate and ethylene-glycol concentrations in rats dosed with ethylene-carbonate were 0.028 and 2.3 umol/g, respectively. The respective halflives were 0.25 and 2 hours. The peak blood ethylene-glycol concentration in ethylene-glycol dosed rats was 1.1 umol/g. The half life was 3 hours. It was concluded that ethylene-carbonate is rapidly metabolized to ethylene-glycol in-vivo. The systemic toxicity following oral administration of ethylene-carbonate is probably due to its being converted into ethylene-glycol.",

Technical error accounted for solitary maternal lethalities in 1500 and 3000 mg/kg/day groups. Clinical signs of toxicity associated with treatment included post dose salivation (750, 1500, 3000 mg/kg/day), chromodacryorrhea (1500 mg/kg/day), dyspnea (1500, 3000 mg/kg/day), alopecia, decreased body tone, decreased activity and dyspnea (3000 mg/kg/day). Suppressed group mean body weight gain was biologically significant in dams of 3000 mg/kg doses, while food consumption appeared unaffected by treatment. Caesarian section and fetal analyses (at least 24-26 litters, 337-382 fetuses/group) on GD 20 revealed no statistically significant (p</= 0.05) departure from controls in fetal mortality, number of gravid animals per group, total number of implantation sites, viable fetuses, non-viable fetuses, early or late resorptions, corpora lutea, fetal sex distribution, or number and percentage of pre-implantation or post-implantation losses. Group mean fetal body weights were significantly depressed from dams of 1500 and 3000 mg/kg/day dose groups. Fetuses of high-dose (3000 mg/kg/day) dams also exhibited statistically significant increased incidence (10%) of external, soft tissue, and skeletal malformations relative to both current and historical controls. Specifically, increased ossification of the sternebrae 1-4 and non-ossification of the 6th sternebra (1500, 3000 mg/kg/day) and increased incidence of bipartite thoracic vertebra (3000 mg/kg/day) reached statistical significance; fetuses of 3000 mg/kg/day also exhibited an increased, but not statistically significant, incidence of bipartite lumbar vertebra.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.80X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethylene carbonate will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase ethylene carbonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 160 hours. It may also undergo direct photolysis in the environment since this compound contains a functional group that can absorb light >290 nm. If released to soil, ethylene carbonate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 9.2. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.74X10-4 atm-cum/mole. Ethylene carbonate achieved 64.1 percent of its theoretical BOD using an activated sludge inoculum during a 2 week incubation period, in a single screening study. If released into water, ethylene carbonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Ethylene carbonate is expected to undergo hydrolysis due to the presence of hydrolyzable functional groups. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to ethylene carbonate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethylene carbonate is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

If released to the atmosphere, 4-hydroxybiphenyl will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases based on an estimated vapor pressure of 1.8X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 4-hydroxybiphenyl is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 6 hours. Particulate-phase 4-hydroxybiphenyl may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). An estimated Koc of 1300 suggests that 4-hydroxybiphenyl will have low mobility in soil. Volatilization from dry and moist soil surfaces is not expected to be a major fate process for this compound. Based on limited data, this compound may be resistant to aerobic biodegradation in both soil and water. 4-Hydroxybiphenyl at 30 mg/l was inoculated with activated sludge; over 4 weeks, 0% of the theoretical BOD was obtained. A pure Pseudomonas culture, however, was able to utilize 4-hydroxybiphenyl as the sole carbon source. In water, 4-hydroxybiphenyl may adsorb to suspended matter in the water column based on its Koc value. 4-Hydroxybiphenyl is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.2X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is expected to be moderate, not high based on measured BCF values from 30-57 in orange-red killifish. The general population may be exposed to this compound by ingestion of contaminated drinking water, infalation of air and dermal contact with products containing this compound. (SRC)",

The quantum yield of photoxidation for 4-hydroxybiphenyl in water, using a sensitizer, was measured as 0.09, suggesting that this compound may photodegrade under environmental conditions(3). 4-Hydroxybiphenyl has measured pseudo-first-order rate constants of 0.90, <0.076, and 0.72/hr for the dark reaction with MnOx, direct photolysis without MnOx, and the reaction with MnOx in sunlight, respectively at pH 4.2(4). This indicates that sunlight does not enhance the rate of the oxidation reaction between MnOx and 4-hydroxybiphenyl(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "Substance Registry Services (SRS) is the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) central system for information about substances that are tracked or regulated by EPA or other sources. It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

Sequential sampling was performed of 46 human milk-fed white infants; 24 received 400 IU/day of vitamin D2, and 22 received placebo. An additional 12 patients were followed who received standard infant formula. 83% of patients completed a full 6 months of the study. Ultraviolet B light exposure and measurements of growth did not differ between groups. At 6 months, the human milk groups did not differ significantly in bone mineral content or serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, although total 25-hydroxyvitamin D values were significantly less in the unsupplemented human milk group (23.53 + or - 9.94 vs 36.96 + or - 11.86 ng/ml; p< 0.01). However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 serum concentrations were significantly higher in the unsupplemented human milk-fed group compared with the supplemented group (21.77 + or - 9.73 vs 11.74 + or - 10.27 ng/ml, p< 0.01) by 6 months of age. It was concluded that unsupplemented, human milk-fed infants had no evidence of vitamin D deficiency during the first 6 months of life.",

Cholecalciferol, given as an oral bolus in oil, resulted in a rapid elevation of plasma concentration of cholecalciferol followed by a rapid decline. In contrast, 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in plasma increased until day 3 after administration and remained elevated for a further 5 days. When 337 microg of both cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol in oil were given as an oral bolus to 10 cats, the peak plasma concentrations of cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol occurred at 8 or 12 h after administration. Peak concentrations of cholecalciferol were over twice those of ergocalciferol (570 +/- 80 vs. 264 +/- 42 nmol/l). The area under the curve 0-169 h for cholecalciferol was also more than twice that for ergocalciferol. When ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol were administered in a parenteral oil-based emulsion, higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 than 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 were maintained in plasma. When both vitamins were included in the diet in the nutritional range, plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 were 0.68 of those of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Discrimination against ergocalciferol by cats appears to result from differences in affinity of the binding protein for the metabolites of the two forms of vitamin D. These results indicate that cats discriminate against ergocalciferol, and use it with an efficiency of 0.7 of that of cholecalciferol to maintain plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.",

Vitamin D deficiency resulting from malabsorption may be a factor in the etiology of low bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with CF. OBJECTIVE: Absorption of oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and the consequent response of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in 10 adults with CF and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was compared with that of 10 healthy control subjects. DESIGN: In this pharmacokinetic study, CF patients and control subjects were pair-matched on age, sex, and race. Each subject consumed 2500 microg oral vitamin D2 with a meal. The CF group also took pancreatic enzymes that provided > or = 80000 U lipase. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 5, 10, 24, 30, and 36 h after vitamin D2 consumption to measure serum vitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations. RESULTS: Vitamin D2 concentrations in all subjects were near zero at baseline. CF patients absorbed less than one-half the amount of oral vitamin D2 that was absorbed by control subjects (P < 0.001). Absorption by the CF patients varied greatly; 2 patients absorbed virtually no vitamin D2. The rise in 25-hydroxyvitamin D in response to vitamin D2 absorption was significantly lower over time in the CF group than in the control group (P = 0.0012). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D2 absorption was significantly lower in CF patients than in control subjects. These results may help explain the etiology of vitamin D deficiency in CF patients, which may contribute to their low BMD.",

Structural analysis of the calcitriol receptor indicates that it belongs to the same supergene family as the steroid receptors.

Paradoxically, the cells responsible for bone resorption (osteoclasts) are not directly acted upon by calcitriol and do not appear to contain calcitriol receptors. Instead, calcitriol causes an increase in the number of osteoclasts available to resorb bone; this may result from an action upon myeloid hematopoietic precursor cells that are induced to differentiate toward functional osteoclasts. The cells responsible for bone formation (osteoblasts) do contain receptors, and calcitriol causes them to elaborate several proteins, including osteocalcin, a vitamin K-dependent protein that contains gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. The exact role of this protein is not known, but other unidentified substances are also elaborated that appear to stimulate the function of osteoclasts. In addition, calcitriol acts synergistically with gamma-interferon to increase the production of interleukin-1, a lymphokine that promotes bone resorption.",

The placebo group and some in the 28,000 IU group continued to receive their assigned treatment for 26 weeks postpartum while the others stopped treatment after delivery. Baseline maternal vitamin D status was similar across all participants with 65% being biochemically vitamin D deficient. The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 12 to 14 weeks and was similar between each of the groups. Infant vitamin D supplementation was uncommon (<10%). One thousand one hundred sixty-four infants were available for analysis. There were no differences between the groups in infant growth at 1 year postpartum. There were also no differences in infant mortality, hospitalizations, respiratory tract infections, serum calcium status, or early childhood bone mineral density and grip strength. Infant hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria occurred rarely (\u22641%) and did not differ between groups. Radiologically confirmed rickets occurred in 4 infants (0.3%), 3 in the placebo group and 1 in the lowest dose group. However, a difference between the groups could not be determined due to such a low incidence. The frequency of infant biochemical rickets at 6 months of age was significantly higher in the placebo group (7.9%) compared to the high-dose group (1.3%), but not compared to the other groups.",

Eight days after administration of glutethimide, plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase activity rose above the upper limit of normal, peaking at 90 IU/L on days 18-22 of therapy. The plasma calcium concentration fell to within the normal range on day 13. The serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D began to fall within 4 days, and after 8 days it was near the lower limit of the reference range, at 70 pmol/L. The serum concentration of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D did not change appreciably until hepatic enzymes were induced; thereafter it fell gradually. Although the 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration remained high, the concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D did not rise again but remained within the lower part of the normal range.",

Vitamin D2 was administered orally at the dosage of 5X10+4 to 60X10+4 IU/kg, once daily for 4 days. Animals fed cholesterol showed a decrease in mortality due to vitamin D2 treatment. Dietary cholesterol inhibited toxic responses such as a diminished growth rate following anorexia, elevated serum calcium level and calcium deposition in tissues, which were produced by a sublethal dose of vitamin D2 (20X10+4 IU/kg, once daily for 4 days). Animals pretreated with the high cholesterol diet from 2 wk before the first vitamin D2 administration showed much more symptomatic relief than those given this diet after the first vitamin D2 administration. On the other hand, dexamethasone as well as corticosterone remarkably increased the mortality due to vitamin D2. The degree of vitamin D2 toxicity, enhanced by dexamethasone, was correlated with the degree of hypercalcemia and tissue calcification. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of cholesterol is not likely to be due to activation of the cholesterol corticosterone system in the adrenal gland.",

Nine patients were studied before and after treatment with vitamin D2 4000 IU daily for 24 wk and 10 before and after treatment with vitamin D3 in the same dose. Before treatment the serum concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D and 25(OH)D were significantly lower in epileptics than in normal subjects (p< 0.01). Vitamin D2 treatment increased the serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D2, but a corresponding decrease in 1,25(OH)2D3 resulted in an unchanged serum concentration of total 1,25(OH)2D. The serum concentration of 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D increase significantly, whereas there was a small decrease in 25(OH)D3. Vitamin D3 treatment did not change the serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D3 whereas serum 25(OH)D3 increased significantly. The correlation between the serum ratio of 1,25(OH)2D2/1,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D2/25(OH)D3 estimated on vitamin D2 treated epileptic patients and normal subjects was highly significant (p< 0.01). The data indicate that the serum concentration of 1,25(OH)2D2 and 1,25(OH)2D3 are directly proportional to the amount of their precursors 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 and that the concentration of total 1,25(OH)2D is tightly regulated.",

At the end of the final irradiation, histological and analytical studies were performed. Topical application of ergocalcifero significantly prevented wrinkle formation and abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix components. In addition, ergocalcifero suppressed excessive secretion of IL-6 induced by UV irradiation in cultured human normal keratinocytes, in a dose-dependent manner. Ergocalcifero promoted keratinocytes differentiation in the epidermis and showed diverse physiological effects, the same as the active form of VD(3). The results suggested that the suppression of skin photodamage involved the promotion of keratinocytes differentiation and suppression of IL-6 secretion induced by exposure to UV. Topical application of ergocalciferol may become an effective means to suppress solar UV-induced human skin damage.",

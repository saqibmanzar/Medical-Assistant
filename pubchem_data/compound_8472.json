ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used primarily as an intermediate in the manufacture of pesticides. It is also used as a fireproofing agent in the production of textiles, as an intermediate in the production of flame-retardant polymers for polyurethane foams, and as a catalyst. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Examination of 179 employees involved in manufacturing of TMP failed to reveal any indications of ocular changes or other adverse effects on worker health associated with occupational exposure to trimethyl phosphite. It is only moderately toxic by oral ingestion and an irritant to eyes, skin and upper respiratory system. ANIMAL STUDIES: Topical application of trimethyl phosphite produced moderately severe but persistent irritation on rabbit skin. Instillation of undiluted trimethyl phosphite into the rabbit eye caused severe ocular irritation and swelling, which lasted for several days. No permanent damage to the eye could be detected. Marked mortality (> 70%) /was demonstrated/ among rats exposed at 600 ppm, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Ten percent of the rats exposed at 300 ppm also died. Gross histological evidence of lung inflammation was observed in the animals exposed at 600 ppm, but no such changes occurred in those subjected to 300 or 100 ppm. Clinical signs of ocular irritation occurred in the animals exposed at 100 ppm or higher concentrations. Severe cataract developed in the 600 ppm exposure group, and mild cataracts from 300 ppm; 100 ppm exposures caused mild, reversible \"striate opacities\" of the lenses of a few animals. TMP was administered by gavage to pregnant rats at rates of 16, 49, or 164 mg/kg/day, on gestation Days 6 through 15. Acetyl salicylic acid (250 mg/kg/day) was also administered to a group of rats as a positive control. Teratologic evaluation revealed gross fetal abnormalities, skeletal defects, and soft tissue defects at a dose rate of 164 mg/kg/day of trimethyl phosphite, but not at the two lesser rates. An increased frequency of fetal resorption was also observed at 164 mg/kg/day. Trimethyl phosphite was genotoxic in three separate mouse lymphoma assays, either with or without microsomal activation. Trimethyl phosphite was also positive in a battery of Drosophila melanogaster mutagenicity assays and in a bacterial DNA damage/repair suspension assay using various strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Trimethyl phosphite failed to show evidence for genetic toxicity in Salmonella and Saccharomyces strains, in a cell transformation assay, in a bacterial DNA repair assay (Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium) or in two Salmonella/mammalian-microsome preincubation assays.",

LD50 value for trimethyl phosphite following intragastric administration was found to be 2.45 g/kg and following intraperitoneal administration--2.25 g/kg; for triethyl phosphite these values were: 4.00 g/kg after intragastric administration and 1.50 g/kg after intraperitoneal administration, respectively. In local action both phosphites mildly irritate the skin, eye and conjunctiva. A weak sensitizing effect of triethyl phosphite was found. Trimethyl and triethyl phosphites have general toxic effects. A particular direction of their action is demonstrated by acroparalysis. Apart from general action they were found to show systemic action and induce parenchymatous degeneration of the liver and kidneys, whatever route of administration. Administered intragastrically, they result in mucosa necrosis, ulceration and fibrino-purulent exudate, exfoliating the mucosa.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 24 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trimethyl phosphite will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase trimethyl phosphite will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 33 minutes. Trimethyl phosphite does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, adsorption to soil, volatilization from moist soil surfaces, and biodegradation are not expected to be important fate processes due to a rapid hydrolysis of trimethyl phosphite. Trimethyl phosphite may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, adsorption to suspended solids and sediment, volatilization from water surfaces, bioconcentration, and biodegradation are not expected to be important fate processes due to the rapid hydrolysis of triethyl phosphite. Trimethyl phosphite hydrolyzes in water to form dimethyl phosphite and methanol. The hydrolysis product, dimethyl phosphite, reached 48% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks in the Japanese MITI test indicating it is inherently biodegradable, but not readily biodegradable. The hydrolysis rate of trimethyl phosphite is expected to be similar to the hydrolysis rate of triethyl phosphite. In acid solution (pH = 4) triethyl phosphite hydrolyzes immediately forming diethyl phosphite and ethanol. At pH 7, triethyl phosphite hydrolyzes completely within 20 minutes; after 3 hours 89.3% diethyl phosphite and 10.7% monoethyl phosphite are formed. At pH 9, the half-life of triethyl phosphite in water is approximately 5.1 hours; 70% of the substance remains unhydrolyzed after 3 hours. Occupational exposure to trimethyl phosphite may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trimethyl phosphite is produced or used. Exposure of the general population to trimethyl phosphite is unlikely since it is used as a chemical intermediate and it is expected to hydrolyze rapidly in the environment. (SRC)",

The hydrolysis rate of trimethyl phosphite is expected to be similar to the hydrolysis rate of triethyl phosphite(SRC). In acid solution (pH=4) triethyl phosphite hydrolyzes immediately forming diethyl phosphite and ethanol(3). At pH 7, triethyl phosphite hydrolyzes completely within 20 minutes; after 3 hours 89.3% diethyl phosphite and 10.7% monoethyl phosphite are formed(3). At pH 9, the half-life of triethyl phosphite in water is approximately 5.1 hours; 70% of the substance remains unhydrolyzed after 3 hours(3). Trimethyl phosphite is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 24 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). Dimethyl phosphite, an hydrolysis product of trimethyl phosphite, reached 48% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks in the Japanese MITI test indicating it is inherently biodegradable, but not readily biodegradable(1).",

Trimethyl phosphite hydrolyzes in water to form dimethyl phosphite and methanol(1,2). The hydrolysis rate of trimethyl phosphite is expected to be similar to the hydrolysis rate of triethyl phosphite(SRC). In acid solution (pH=4) triethyl phosphite hydrolyzes immediately forming diethyl phosphite and ethanol(3). At pH 7, triethyl phosphite hydrolyzes completely within 20 minutes; after 3 hours 89.3% diethyl phosphite and 10.7% monoethyl phosphite are formed(3). At pH 9, the half-life of triethyl phosphite in water is approximately 5.1 hours; 70% of the substance remains unhydrolyzed after 3 hours(3). Dimethyl phosphite, an hydrolysis product of trimethyl phosphite, reached 48% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks in the Japanese MITI test indicating it is inherently biodegradable, but not readily biodegradable(1).",

Vapor-phase trimethyl phosphite is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 33 minutes(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.1X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Trimethyl phosphite does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

At pH 7, triethyl phosphite hydrolyzes completely within 20 minutes; after 3 hours 89.3% diethyl phosphite and 10.7% monoethyl phosphite are formed(5). At pH 9, the half-life of triethyl phosphite in water is approximately 5.1 hours; 70% of the substance remains unhydrolyzed after 3 hours(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

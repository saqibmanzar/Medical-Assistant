PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The in vitro metabolism of the ergot alkaloid ergotamine in mouse liver microsomes was characterized by LC-MS/MS and compared between both lines before and after exposure to E+ feed. ... Microsomal incubations produced nine predominate peaks in the HPLC assay. The peaks were confirmed by LC-MS/MS to be ergotamine, ergotamine epimer, monohydroxylated metabolites (M1, M2, M1e, M2e) and dihydroxylated metabolites (M3--5). A gender difference for metabolite formation was observed on the E- diet, in that females produced a greater amount of M1, M1e and M3--5 than males. When challenged with the E+ diet, mice showed differences in concentration of M3 for line (resistant > susceptible) and gender (female > male) and of M4 and M5 for gender (female > male). Gender differences in the metabolism of ergotamine have not been shown before in these lines of mice or other species used to study ergot alkaloid metabolism. ...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In therapeutic doses, ergotamine causes peripheral vasoconstriction (if the vascular tone is low) primarily by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors; however, the drug causes vasodilation in very hypertonic vessels. With higher doses, ergotamine is also a competitive alpha-adrenergic blocker, but this effect is somewhat masked by the drug's alpha-adrenergic agonist activity. With therapeutic doses, ergotamine also inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine, thereby maintaining a high concentration of circulating norepinephrine and increasing ergotamine's vasoconstrictor action. Ergotamine has greater vasoconstrictor activity than the other ergot alkaloids but less alpha-adrenergic blocking activity than dihydroergotamine. Ergotamine is a weaker antagonist of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) than is methysergide, but ergotamine does reduce the increased rate of platelet aggregation induced by serotonin. The mechanism by which ergotamine aborts vascular headaches is probably direct vasoconstriction of the dilated carotid artery bed with a concomitant decrease in the amplitude of pulsations; the drug's effects on catecholamines and serotonin are also at least partly involved.",

This study set out to investigate the pharmacological profile of the antinociception produced by intrathecal and intraplantar administration of ergotamine (a 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT5A/5B receptor agonist) and valerenic acid (a partial agonist at 5-HT5A receptors). Intraplantar injection of 1% formalin in the right hind paw resulted in spontaneous flinching behavior of the injected hindpaw of female Wistar rats. Intrathecal ergotamine (15 nmol) or valerenic acid (1 nmol) blocked in a dose dependent manner formalin-induced nociception. The antinociception by intrathecal ergotamine (15 nmol) or valerenic acid (1 nmol) was partly or completely blocked by intrathecal administration of the antagonists: (i) methiothepin (non-selective 5-HT5A/5B; 0.01-0.1 nmol); (ii) SB-699551 (selective 5-HT5A; up to 10 nmol); (iii) anti-5-HT5A antibody; (iv) SB-224289 (selective 5-HT1B; 0.1-1 nmol); or (v) BRL-15572 (selective 5-HT1D; 0.1-1 nmol). Likewise, antinociception by intraplantar ergotamine (15 nmol) and valerenic acid (10 nmol) was: (i) partially blocked by methiothepin (1 nmol), SB-699551 (10 nmol) or SB-224289 (1 nmol); and (ii) abolished by BRL-15572 (1 nmol). The above doses of antagonists (which did not affect per se the formalin-induced nociception) were high enough to completely block their respective receptors. Our results suggest that ergotamine and valerenic acid produce antinociception via 5-HT5A and 5-HT1B/1D receptors located at both spinal and peripheral sites. This provides new evidence for understanding the modulation of nociceptive pathways in inflammatory pain.",

The present study has reanalyzed this suggestion by using more selective antagonists alone and in combination. Fifty-two anesthetized dogs were prepared for ultrasonic measurements of external carotid blood flow. The animals were divided into thirteen groups (n=4 each) receiving an i.v. bolus injection of, either physiological saline (0.3 mL/kg; control), or the antagonists SB224289 (300 ug/kg; 5-HT1B), BRL15572 (300 ug /kg; 5-HT1D), rauwolscine (300 ug /kg; alpha2), SB224289 + BRL15572 (300 ug /kg each), SB224289 + rauwolscine (300 ug /kg each), BRL15572 + rauwolscine (300 ug/kg each), rauwolscine (300 ug/kg) + prazosin (100 ug/kg; alpha1), SB224289 (300 ug /kg) + prazosin (100 ug /kg), SB224289 (300 ug/kg) + rauwolscine (300 ug/kg) + prazosin (100 ug/kg), SB224289 (300 ug/kg) + prazosin (100 ug/kg) + BRL44408 (1,000 ug/kg; alpha2A), SB224289 (300 ug /kg) + prazosin (100 ug/kg)+ imiloxan (1,000 ug/kg; alpha2B), or SB224289 (300 ug /kg) + prazosin (100 ug/kg) + MK912 (300 ug/kg; alpha2C). Each group received consecutive 1-min intracarotid infusions of ergotamine (0.56, 1, 1.8, 3.1, 5.6, 10 and 18 ug/min), following a cumulative schedule. In saline-pretreated animals, ergotamine induced dose-dependent decreases in external carotid blood flow without affecting arterial blood pressure or heart rate. These control responses were: unaffected by SB224289, BRL15572, rauwolscine or the combinations of SB224289 + BRL15572, BRL15572 + rauwolscine, rauwolscine + prazosin, SB224289 + prazosin, or SB224289 + prazosin + imiloxan; slightly blocked by SB224289 + rauwolscine; and markedly blocked by SB224289 + rauwolscine + prazosin, SB224289 + prazosin + BRL44408 or SB224289 + prazosin + MK912. Thus, the cranio-selective vasoconstriction elicited by ergotamine in dogs is predominantly mediated by 5-HT1B receptors as well as alpha2A/2C-adrenoceptor subtypes and, to a lesser extent, by alpha1-adrenoceptors.",

Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral (MCA) and in basilar (BA) arteries were measured. Data from patients were obtained in the interval between migraine attacks, during migraine attacks and following treatment with either ergotamine (0.5 mg im; n = 1O); frunarizine, a calcium overload blocker (20 mg iv; n =13); or a 5-HTl-like agonist (sumatriptan, 4 mg sc; n = 6). Ergotamine and sumatriptan are constrictors of cerebral arteries in animal experiments. The arithmetic mean of flow velocity in the BA was reduced in normal subjects (45 cm/s) as compared with patients with migraine measured in between attacks (53 cm/s). Mean flow velocity in MCA was not different in normals (72.5 cm/s) as compared with migraineurs (75 cm/s). Neither ergotamine nor the 5-HTl agonist and flunarizine resulted in a significant change in blood flow velocity in MCA and BA. This was true irrespective of whether the drugs were given in the headache-free period, during a migraine attack or during the withdrawal phase of drug-induced headache. Ergotamine was effective in improving headache during migraine attacks and sumatriptan attenuated headache during drug withdrawal from chronic analgesic intake. These results indicate that the action of ergotamine and the 5-HTl-receptor agonist is probably not mediated by their vasoconstrictor action on cerebral arteries.",

The common technique today is to grow the fungus in submerged culture. Claviceps paspali (Stevens and Hall) is said to be more productive than C. purpurea (Fries). In this way, ergotamine and ergonovine are produced. Ergotamine is obtained from crude extract by formation of an aluminum complex. Destruction of the aluminum complex with ammonia then permits hydrocarbon extraction of the alkaloid. The alkaloid is subsequently both isolated and used as its tartrate salt.",

The method was based on the application of QuEChERS salts for extraction and modified QuEChERS dispersive SPE for the cleanup step. Alkaloids separation was performed on a C18, 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 um column with the mobile phase containing ammonium carbonate and acetonitrile. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 330 and 420 nm respectively. The method was validated according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and all parameters are in agreement with the requirements of the Decision. Linearity was determined for the concentration range of 25-400 ug/kg. The coefficient of determination (R2) for all curves was from 0.985 to 0.996. The limit of detection (LOD) was in the range 3.23 to 6.53 ug/kg and the limit of quantification (LOQ) from 11.78 to 13.06 ug/kg. The decision limit (CCalpha) ranged from 29.56 to 43.08 ug/kg and detection capability (CCbeta) from 40.65 to 51.01 ug/kg. The highest coefficient of variation (CV) for repeatability was 14.3% and for reproducibility 15.4%.",

The calibration curve was linear over the range 0.03-0.61 mg/L of ET (sufficient for the dissolution tests). Equation of the calibration curve was calculated giving the following values: F=117.7 c+0.80 (n=6); r=0.9998. Detection limit was 0.01 mg/L of ET. The R.S.D. is less than 0.54 and 0.86% (n=10) when determining 0.61 and 0.03 mg/L of ET in standard solution, respectively. The dissolution test of Bellaspon tablets (0.3 mg of ET in 1 tablet) was programmed for 20 min, with a continuous sampling rate of 120 hr(-1) under conditions required by BP 1993. /Ergotamine tartrate/",

Ergotamine and the internal standard, trideuterated lysergic acid diethylamide, were extracted from human urine, blood, and hair by means of liquid-liquid extraction at alkaline pH. Gradient elution on a cyanopropyl column was used for chromatographic separation. Positive ion electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry determination by collision-induced dissociation were performed in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The method was validated and successfully applied to a case of iatrogenic ergotism resulting from the intake of ergotamine tartrate for treating headache. For the first time, ergotamine was identified and quantified in hair. The ergotamine concentrations measured were 320 pg/mL in blood, 100 pg/mL in urine, 24 pg/mg in proximal hair, and 15 pg/mg in distal hair.",

A number of outbreaks of a hyperthermia syndrome in cattle, characterized by severe loss in milk production, loss of body mass and reduced fertility, are described. In one major outbreak in March to April 1994, a milling company reported that 2,646 dairy cows on 29 farms had developed clinical signs. In this outbreak, significant levels of ergotamine, ergosine, ergocornine and ergocryptine were found in the milled dairy rations fed to the affected cows. Barley screenings containing ergotized annual-ryegrass seed was identified as the toxic component and probable source of the ergot alkaloids in the ration. The clinical syndrome was reproduced experimentally by feeding suspected feed to a group of nine high-producing Ayrshire cows. An outbreak of gangrenous necrosis of the extremities in young cattle in the winter of 1987 was also suspected of having been caused by ergot alkaloids in grain screenings.",

It is also used in veterinary medicine. HUMAN STUDIES: There have been reports of drug abuse and psychological dependence in patients on ergotamine tartrate therapy. In addition to the adverse effects which may occur with usual doses or prolonged administration of high doses (especially adverse vasospastic effects, nausea, and vomiting), acute overdosage of ergotamine may cause lassitude, impaired mental function, confusion, depression, drowsiness, delirium, severe dyspnea, hypotension, hypertension, rapid and weak pulse, unconsciousness, spasms of the limbs, seizures (rarely), shock, and death. Ergotism is manifested by intense arterial vasoconstriction, producing signs and symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia. Ergotamine induces vasoconstriction by a direct action on vascular smooth muscle. In chronic intoxication with ergot derivatives, headache, intermittent claudication, muscle pains, numbness, coldness, and pallor of the digits may occur. If the condition is allowed to progress untreated, gangrene can result. Nausea and vomiting, due to a direct effect on CNS emetic centers, occur in approximately 10% of patients after oral administration of ergotamine, and in about twice that number after parenteral administration. Leg weakness is common, and muscle pains that occasionally are severe may occur in the extremities. Numbness and tingling of the fingers and toes are other reminders of the ergotism that this alkaloid may cause. Precordial distress and pain suggestive of angina pectoris, as well as transient tachycardia or bradycardia, also have been noted, presumably as a result of coronary vasospasm induced by ergotamine. Ergotamine has been tested for its ability to induce chromosomal damage in human lymphocyte cells. Treatment with 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 ug/mL significantly increased frequency of aberrations. Ergotamine is contraindicated in pregnant women. ANIMAL STUDIES: It is suggested that dietary ergotamine is atherogenic in the rabbit. Daily oral doses of 1.0 mg/kg of ergotamine tartrate resulted in death of 4 of 6 sheep in 10 days. Postmortem exam revealed intestinal inflammation. 0.5 mg/day over a period of 10 days was not fatal. Extended exposure of bulls to ergotamine appeared to reduce fertilization potential of sperm. Single-day oral treatment of rats with ergotamine (10 mg/kg) causes fetal deaths. In early pregnancy, from days 4-10, mortality was only 0-11%, and on days 14 and 15, 62% and 59% respectively. Typical anomalies resulting from \"edema syndrome\" were seen only on days 13-16. Male mice were injected with 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg ergotamine, and significant number of chromosome aberrations were observed with higher doses. Almost all damage was in form of chromatid aberrations. Dominant lethal test with mice using ergotamine was negative in doses up to 100 mg/kg. Several accidental poisonings in cows were described in the literature.",

Use with sympathomimetics (pressor agents) may cause extreme elevation of blood pressure. The beta-blocker Inderal (propranolol) has been reported to potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine. Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients, predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy. The blood levels of ergotamine-containing drugs are reported to be elevated by the concomitant administration of macrolide antibiotics and vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of the ergotamine-containing drugs when coadministered with these antibiotics.",

The effect on peripheral arteries, measured as a decrease in toe-arm systolic gradients, developed slowly and was well sustained after 29 hr. In contrast, ergotamine was quickly absorbed (half-life = 3 min) and plasma levels (measured by HPLC) declined, with a biologic half-life of 2.5 hr. A hypothetic effect compartment model was adopted and kinetic and dynamic data were simultaneously fitted on a computer. Calculated from mean data, the rate constant for equilibration of the drug between plasma and effector site was 0.07 hr-1, with a half-life of 9.9 hr, and the steady-state plasma concentration resulting in 50% of maximal effect (Cpss50) was 0.24 ng/mL. The largest variability for the estimated kinetic and dynamic parameters among subjects was found for Cpss50 (coefficient of variation = 110%), indicating that, in addition to some kinetic variability, dynamic variability (difference in sensitivity) should be anticipated in the therapeutic use of ergotamine.",

Vasoconstriction may cause coronary insufficiency with precipitation or aggravation of angina pectoris and possibly myocardial infarction and death. Cold, numb, painful extremities with or without paresthesia have occurred; pulses of the affected extremity are often diminished or absent. Claudication of the legs may occur. When the drug is discontinued, symptoms of impaired peripheral circulation are usually reversible. Gangrene of extremities may develop but is rare with usual doses in patients without peripheral vascular disease or other contraindications.",

The possibility of adverse effects from other ingredients in combination products should be considered. Toxicity is likely to occur in patients with sepsis or in those with renal or hepatic impairment. Patients with peripheral vascular disease are especially at risk of developing peripheral ischemia associated with ergotamine. Acute toxicity usually has been reported at ergotamine tartrate dosages exceeding 15 mg in 24 hours or 40 mg in a few days; however, toxicity has been reported in some patients receiving less than 5 mg of the drug. Death occurred in one 14-month-old child who ingested 12 mg of ergotamine tartrate and 1.2 g of caffeine. Another 13-month-old child recovered after ingesting approximately 15 mg of ergotamine tartrate, 1 g of phenobarbital, and 5 mg of belladonna.",

After 6 weeks, serum total cholesterol concentration and the ratio of serum total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were significantly increased by ergotamine in a dose-dependent manner. Dietary ergotamine raised the total level of glycosaminoglycans and the relative proportion of chondroitin sulphate in the abdominal aorta.

The influence of dihydroergotoxine, bromocriptine, and ergotamine was studied on the erection ability in intact, two-grade outbred male Wistar albino rats that were out of their estrous phase. The experimental animals were injected intrapenially with the substances under examination: dihydroergotoxine mesylate (0.1 mg/0.1 mL, 0.3 mg/0.1 mL, and 1 mg/0.1 mL), bromocriptine mesylate (0.3 mg/0.1 mL, 1 mg/0.1 mL, and 3 mg/0.1 mL), and ergotamine tartrate (0.1 mg/0.1 mL, 0.3 mg/0.1 mL, and 1mg/0.1 mL). Every dose was tested on a pattern of 30 rats. These mentioned substances were injected in the amount of 1 mm to the left of the proximal part of the superficial dorsal vein of the penis, in the region of the penis root. After injection, the animals were then observed within the next 90 minutes. In the trial, the following was observed: the number of rats with an erection achieved, the period of time from intrapenial application to the appearance of the first erection, and the duration of the erection. Ultimately, the research results confirm the efficiency of dihydroergotoxine and bromocriptine as erectogenic agents, as well as ergotamine as a detumescent compared with saline solutions.",

Bulls were allotted to a control diet of cracked corn, corn silage, and soybean meal (CON, n = 8) or a diet supplemented daily with 40 ug/kg body weight of ergotamine tartrate (ET, n = 8). Blood samples, average daily gain, scrotal circumference and rectal temperatures were collected every 14 day. Semen samples were obtained every 60 day and evaluated for motility and morphology. Scrotal temperatures were obtained by thermography immediately before electroejaculation. Semen from a subset of bulls from each treatment was also evaluated for in vitro fertilization. Administration of ET increased rectal temperature and resulted in lower scrotal temperatures compared to CON bulls (P < 0.05). However, prolactin, scrotal circumference, testosterone, and semen motility and morphology did not differ between groups throughout the experimental period (224 day). Cleavage rates of embryos derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF) with semen of bulls, fed with ET, were reduced compared to CON (P < 0.05); however, development of cleaved embryos to blastocyst did not differ between treatments. In conclusion, extended exposure of bulls to ET appeared to reduce fertilization potential of sperm.",

Ergotamine is one of many ergot alkaloids produced by the parasitic fungus Claviceps, mainly C purpurea, that infests grains such as rye, wheat, rice, corn, millet and oat. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.6X10-24 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ergotamine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase ergotamine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Ergotamine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ergotamine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 270,000. The estimated pKa of ergotamine is 8.75, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Ergotamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, ergotamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated pKa. An estimated BCF of 23 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to ergotamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ergotamine is extracted or administered, or where grains contaminated with ergotamine are processed and used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to ergotamine via consumption of grain products containing ergotamine and via its use as a drug. (SRC)",

An estimated pKa of 8.75(3) indicates ergotamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). Ergotamine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the absence of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 23(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.53(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2017).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

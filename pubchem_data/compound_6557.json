If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Pharmacokinetic analysis of isoprene inhaled by rats and mice revealed saturation kinetics of isoprene metabolism in both species. For rats and mice, linear pharmacokinetics apply at exposure concentrations below 300 ppm isoprene. Saturation of isoprene metabolism is practically complete at atmospheric concentrations of about 1000 ppm in rats and about 2000 ppm in mice. In the lower concentration range where first-order metabolism applies, metabolic clearance (related to the concentration in the atmosphere) of inhaled isoprene per kilogram body weight was 6200 mL/hr for rats and 12,000 mL/hr for mice. The estimated maximal metabolic elimination rates were 130 umole/hr/kg for rats and 400 umole/hr/kg for mice. This shows that the rate of isoprene metabolism in mice is about two or three times that in rats. When the untreated animals are kept in a closed all-glass exposure system, the exhalation of isoprene into the system can be measured. This shows that the isoprene endogenously produced by the animals is systemically available within the animal organism. From such experiments the endogenous production rate of isoprene was calculated to be 1.9 umole/hr/kg for rats and 0.4 umole/hr/kg for mice. /The/ data indicate that the endogenous production of isoprene should be accounted for when discussing a possible carcinogenic or mutagenic risk of this compound.",

For all exposures, steady-state levels of isoprene were reached rapidly (ie, within 15 to 30 min) after the onset of exposure. The mean (+/- SE) steady-state blood levels of isoprene (identified by headspace analysis) for the 20, 200, and 2000 ppm exposures were 24.8 +/- 3.3, 830 +/- 51, and 6800 +/- 400 ng isoprene/mL blood, respectively. At the two higher exposure concentrations, the increases in blood levels of isoprene were proportional to the increases in air concentrations of isoprene. There was approximately a 2.3-fold decrease in the retained (14)C/inhaled (14)C ratio with increasing exposure concentration. Depending on the exposure concentration, from 52% (20 ppm isoprene) to 73% (2000 ppm isoprene) of the metabolite-associated (nonisoprene) radioactivity was excreted in the urine over a 64-hr postexposure period. (14)C-O2 exhalation after the end of the 6-hr exposure was minimal (2%) at the 20 ppm exposure and increased up to 18% at the higher isoprene exposure concentrations. These data suggest that metabolism of isoprene in mice is nonlinear within the range of exposure concentrations used in this study. Hemoglobin adduct formation reached near-maximum between 200 and 2000 ppm isoprene exposure concentration, consistent with /the/ conclusion that pathways for metabolism of isoprene were saturated. Isoprene metabolites were present in blood after inhalation of isoprene at all concentrations studied. There were substantial differences in the toxicokinetics of inhaled isoprene in mice compared to rats. In mice, fractional retention of inhaled isoprene, which reflects, in part, metabolism of isoprene, was linearly related to exposure concentrations up to 200 ppm but decreased at 2000 ppm; in rats, fractional retention of inhaled isoprene decreased with increasing exposure concentration over a range of exposures from 8 to 1500 ppm.",

Detailed knowledge of the body and tissue burden of inhaled IP and its intermediate epoxides can be gained using a physiological toxicokinetic (PT) model. For this purpose, a PT-model was developed for IP in mouse, rat, and human. Experimentally determined partition coefficients were taken from the literature. Metabolic parameters were obtained from gas-uptake experiments. The measured data could be described by introducing hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism into the model. At exposure concentrations up to 50 ppm, the rate of metabolism at steady-state is 14 times faster in mice and about 8 times faster in rats than in humans (2.5 umol/hr/kg at 50 ppm IP in air). IP does accumulate only barely due to its fast metabolism and its low thermodynamic partition coefficient whole body:air. IP is produced endogenously. This production is negligible in rodents compared to that in humans (0.34 umol/hr/kg). About 90% of IP produced endogenously in humans is metabolized and 10% is exhaled unchanged. The blood concentration of IP in non-exposed humans is predicted to be 9.5 nmol/L. The area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC) following exposure over 8 hr to 10 ppm IP is about 4 times higher than the AUC resulting from the unavoidable endogenous IP over 24 hr...",

In fact, the acute toxicity of isoprene is very similar and also the biotransformation to mono- and diepoxides is qualitatively alike. There is however a difference; isoprene is asymmetric and therefore more metabolic enantiomers are possible. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated species differences (as with butadiene) in the maximum metabolic elimination rate: in mice this was determined to be at least three times higher than in rats which implies a species sensitivity in isoprene metabolism in the mouse.",

The formation of epoxide metabolites was determined by gas chromatographic analysis. CYP2E1 showed the highest rates of formation of the isoprene monoepoxides 3,4-epoxy-3-methyl-1-butene (EPOX-I) and 3,4-epoxy-2-methyl-1-butene (EPOX-II), followed by CYP2B6. CYP2E1 was the only enzyme showing detectable formation of the diepoxide of isoprene, 2-methyl-1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane. Both isoprene monoepoxides were oxidized by CYP2E1 to the diepoxide at similar enzymatic rates. In order to determine the relative role of CYP2E1 in hepatic metabolism, isoprene as well as the two monoepoxides were also incubated with a series of ten human liver microsomal preparations in the presence of the epoxide hydrolase inhibitor cyclohexene oxide. The obtained activities were correlated with activities towards specific substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and CYP3A. The results were supportive for those obtained with single human P450 enzymes. Isoprene (monoepoxide) metabolism sowed a significant correlation with CYP2E1 activity, determined as chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylation. CYP2E1 is therefore the major enzyme involved in hepatic metabolism of isoprene and the isoprene monoepoxides in vitro. To investigae species differences with regard to the role of epoxide hydrolase in the metabolism of isoprene monoepoxides, the epoxidation of isoprene by human liver microsomes was compared to that of mouse and rate liver microsomes. The amounts of monoepoxides formed as a balance between epoxidation and hydrolysis, was measured in incubations with and without the epoxide hydrolase inhibitor cyclohexene oxide. Inhibition of epoxide hydrolase resulted in similar rates of monoepoxide formation in mouse, rat and man. Without inhibitor, however, the total amount of monoepoxides present at the end of the incubation period was twice as high for mouse liver microsomes than for rat and even 15 times as high as for human liver microsomes. Thus, differences in epoxide hydrolase activity between species may be of crucial importance for the toxicity of isoprene in the various species.",

Differences between strains and gender were also investigated. In the production of the isoprene monoepoxides, microsomes from the livers of the male Sprague-Dawley or Wistar rat showed an approximately 2:1 preference for the formation of (S)-2-(1-methylethenyl)oxirane compared with the (R)-enantiomer. No enantioselectivity was observed for mouse or rabbit. In contrast, liver microsomes from dog, monkey or male human preferentially formed (R)-2-(1-methylethenyl)oxirane. There was no enantioselectivity observed with microsomes from female human liver. The significant differences between species in the in vitro metabolism of isoprene indicate that stereochemical and mechanistic data should be taken into account when evaluating the results of animal studies designed to assess the carcinogenic risks to humans that may be associated with exposure to isoprene.",

This route is most viable where ethylene is produced from naphtha or gas oil and where several ethylene plants are located in relatively close proximity to the isoprene plant. Although the yield of isoprene per mass of ethylene is quite low, there is enough ethylene produced to provide a large portion of demand. Because of the presence of n-pentane in these streams which azeotropes with isoprene, extractive distillation must be used to recover pure isoprene. Acetonitrile is the most common solvent, but dimethylformamide is also used commercially.",

Because of the low vapor pressure & low water solubility of these cmpds, the tests were conducted by using ASTM Method F739-85 with a silicone rubber sheeting material as the collection medium. Tests were performed at 20 \u00b0C with butyl, natural, & nitrile rubber glove materials. None of the acrylate cmpds nor mixtures was found to permeate the butyl or nitrile rubber under the test conditions. Permeation through the natural rubber was observed in tests with pure 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, a 50% 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate/50% 2-ethylhexyl acrylate mixture, & a 25% 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate/75% 2-ethylhexyl acrylate mixture. Trimethylolpropane triacrylate permeation through the natural rubber was also detected, but only in one of the triplicate tests after the 360-480 min sampling interval. For pure 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, the breakthrough detection time was 30-60 min & the steady-state permeation rate was 0.92 ug/sq cm-min. For the 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate/2-ethylhexyl acrylate mixtures, permeation of both mixture components was detected during the same sampling interval in each test. The breakthrough detection time was 30-60 min for the 50/50 mixture & from 15-30 to 30-60 min for the 25/75 mixture.",

Commercial glove samples of nitrile rubber (Edmont), natural rubber (Edmont and Baxter), butyl rubber (North), polyvinyl chloride Baxter), a natural rubber/neoprene/nitrile blend (Pioneer), and a natural rubber/neoprene blend (Playtex) were tested according to the ASTM F739-85 permeation test method (open-loop configuration). The liquid formulations examined included a positive photoresist thinner containing 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, and xylene; a positive photoresist containing 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, xylene, polymer resins, and photoactive compounds; a negative photoresist containing 2-methoxyethanol, xylene, and cyclized poly(isoprene); and pure 2-methoxyethyl acetate, which is the solvent used in a commercial electron-beam resist. With the exception of the negative photoresist, butyl rubber provided the highest level of protection against the solvent mixtures tested, with no breakthrough observed after 4 hr of continuous exposure at 25 \u00b0C. Nitrile rubber provided the highest level of protection against the negative photoresist and reasonably good protection against initial exposure to the other solvent mixtures. Gloves consisting of natural rubber or natural rubber blends provided less protection against the mixtures than either nitrile or butyl rubber. For most of the glove samples, permeation of the glycol-ether derivatives contained in the mixtures was faster than that predicted from the permeation of the pure solvents. Increasing the exposure temperature from 25 to 37 \u00b0C did not significantly affect the performance of the butyl rubber glove. For the other gloves, however, exposures at 37 \u00b0C resulted in decreases in breakthrough times of 25-75% and increases in steady-state permeation rates of 80-457% relative to values obtained at 25 \u00b0C. Repeated exposure of nitrile rubber samples resulted in shorter breakthrough times for all mixture components. In fact, exposure for as little as one-half of the nominal breakthrough time followed by air drying overnight resulted in measurable quantities of one or more of the component solvents at the inner surface of the gloves at the beginning of the next exposure. This effect was not observed with the butyl rubber samples. With the exception of the negative photoresist, heating previously exposed nitrile rubber samples at 70 \u00b0C for 20 hr prior to retesting reduced or eliminated the effects of residual solvents, permitting reuse of the gloves. The use of thin polyvinyl chloride or natural rubber gloves adjacent to the nitrile gloves provided moderate increases in permeation resistance.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

It is used in manufacturing butyl rubber, and as copolymer in the production of synthetic elastomers. HUMAN STUDIES: Respiratory irritation is a potential symptom of overexposure. Isoprene may act as a CNS depressant and asphyxiant at high concentrations. Catarrhal inflammation, subtrophic and atrophic processes in the upper respiratory tract, and deterioration of olfaction were noted in isoprene rubber production workers. Prevalence and degree were correlated with increasing length of service. In the comet assay isoprene induced DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the presence of metabolic activation. ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposure of rats of each sex to 0, 438, 875, 1750, 3500 or 7000 ppm isoprene vapors by inhalation for 6 hr a day on 5 days/wk for 2 wk had no effect. In male mice it reduced body weight gain, produced atrophy of the thymus and testis (at 7000 ppm only), olfactory epithelial degeneration, vacuolized liver cytoplasm and forestomach epithelial hyperplasia. In both male and female mice in all exposure groups, there were reductions in erythrocyte numbers, hemoglobin concentration and  volume of packed erythrocytes. An exposure-related increased incidence of liver, lung, Harderian gland and forestomach tumors and hemangiosarcomas and histiocytic sarcomas was reported in mice. In rats, exposed males and females had increased incidences of mammary fibroadenomas. The incidence of renal tubule adenomas was increased in treated males. Some animals also had a renal carcinoma. Treated males also had increased incidence of interstitial-cell adenomas of the testis. Isoprene affected ovarian follicles in 21 day old female mice. In male mice,  there was reduction of testicular weight by 35% in the animals exposed to 7000 ppm, seminiferous tubular atrophy in 20% of animals studied, reduced epididymal weights, lower spermatid headcounts and concentrations, and reduced sperm motility in the 700 and 7000 ppm groups. In developmental studies, there was no treatment-related effect on the incidence of fetal malformations or variations other than a slight increase in the incidence of reduced vertebral ossification. Isoprene was negative when tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome preincubation assay using 5 S. typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, & TA100) with and without metabolic activation. Isoprene did not induce either sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultures of Chinese hamster ovary cells.",

Exposures had durations of 130 min that included alternate periods of rest and light treadmill exercise; breath was sampled pre- and postexposure. For six subjects, breath was resampled 19 +/- 1 hr postexposure. Breath samples were concentrated cryogenically and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. Isoprene output immediately postexposure was significantly reduced by ozone or filtered air (17 and 19%, respectively). These results suggest that exercise alone reduces isoprene levels in breath without an additive ozone effect. However, in the six subjects restudied 19 +/- 1 hr postexposure to ozone, breath isoprene concentrations were now increased above the preexposure output by 99% (P < 0.01) and exceeded the 51% increase in output of isoprene at this time point after filtered-air exposure (P < 0.01)...",

Exposures had durations of 130 min that included alternate periods of rest and light treadmill exercise; breath was sampled pre- and postexposure. For six subjects, breath was resampled 19 +/- 1 hr postexposure. Breath samples were concentrated cryogenically and analyzed by capillary gas chromatography. Isoprene output immediately postexposure was significantly reduced by ozone or filtered air (17 and 19%, respectively). These results suggest that exercise alone reduces isoprene levels in breath without an additive ozone effect. However, in the six subjects restudied 19 +/- 1 hr postexposure to ozone, breath isoprene concentrations were now increased above the preexposure output by 99% (P < 0.01) and exceeded the 51% increase in output of isoprene at this time point after filtered-air exposure (P < 0.01)...",

It is biotransformed to 2-ethenyl-2-methyloxirane (IP-1,2-O) and 2-(1-methylethenyl)oxirane (IP-3,4-O), both of which can be further metabolized to 2-methyl-2,2'-bioxirane (MBO). MBO is mutagenic, but IP-1,2-O and IP-3,4-O are not. While IP-1,2-O has been reported being genotoxic, the genotoxicity of IP-3,4-O and MBO, and the cross-linking potential of MBO have not been examined. In the present study, we used the comet assay to investigate the concentration- and time-dependent genotoxicity profiles of the three metabolites and the cross-linking potential of MBO in human hepatocyte L02 cells. For the incubation time of 1 hr, all metabolites showed positive concentration-dependent profiles with a potency rank order of IP-3,4-O > MBO > IP-1,2-O. In human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human leukemia (HL60) cells, IP-3,4-O was still more potent in inducing DNA breaks than MBO at high concentrations (>200 uM), although at low concentrations (=200 uM) IP-3,4-O exhibited slightly lower or similar potency to MBO. Interestingly, their time-dependent genotoxicity profiles (0.5-4 hr) in L02 cells were different from each other: IP-1,2-O and MBO (200 uM) exhibited negative and positive profiles, respectively, with IP-3,4-O lying in between, namely, IP-3,4-O-caused DNA breaks did not change over the exposure time. Further experiments demonstrated that hydrolysis of IP-1,2-O contributed to the negative profile and MBO induced cross-links at high concentrations and long incubation times. Collectively, the results suggested that IP-3,4-O might play a significant role in the toxicity of isoprene. /Isoprene metabolites/",

Their impact on health, their role in the causation of skin disease, and the measures that can be instituted to regulate, control, and prevent skin problems are receiving increased attention by operating room managers because of the associated costs of skin reactions in operating room nurses and the inherent dangers associated with latex allergy. Latex gloves have become a standard part of operating room attire, and even though they serve as the primary form of hand protection in the operating room, gloves also may serve as one of the key causes of contact or allergic dermatitis in operating room personnel. The high frequency of latex glove allergy, especially in operating room nurses and surgeons, focuses attention on the need to evaluate the type and quality of surgical latex gloves selected for use. When instances of new skin reactions appear in nursing personnel, operating room managers should look for recent changes in glove brands, scrub products, or antimicrobial agents as possible trigger allergens. In such circumstances, managers may wish to use hypoallergenic products as a solution. ..."

Two-week inhalation toxicology studies of isoprene were conducted in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice at exposure concentrations of 0, 438, 875, 1750, 3500, or 7000 ppm. For rats, there were no chemically related changes in survival, body weight gain, clinical signs, hematologic or clinical chemistry parameters, or gross or microscopic lesions. Exposure of mice to isoprene did not produce mortalities and only caused a decrease in body weight gain for male mice in the 7000 ppm exposure group; however, hematologic changes and microscopic lesions including testicular atrophy /(at 7000 ppm)/, olfactory epithelial degeneration /(at 1750, 3500, and 7000 ppm)/, and forestomach epithelial hyperplasia /(all groups)/ were observed in isoprene-exposed mice. Similar toxicologic effects have been previously observed in B6C3F1 mice exposed to 1,3-butadiene. A species difference in susceptibility between rats and mice exposed to isoprene was evident in these short-term exposure studies.",

Animals were evaluated both at 26 weeks and after a further 26-week recovery period. In rats, other than changes to the testes observed at the highest dose  there were no observed effects. For mice, in addition to effects observed in the forestomach and nasal cavity (similar to the 13-week study), changes were observed in the lung following the 26-week recovery period. These were manifested as the increased incidence of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia in the 1950 mg/cu m and higher exposure groups. In addition, the incidence of spinal cord degeneration was significantly increased in all exposure groups following the 26-week recovery period and reversible reduction in hindlimb grip strength was observed in the 613 mg/cu m and higher exposure groups. However, these effects on motor function and spinal cord were not observed in chronic carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats.",

The results showed that isoprene exposure did not cause measurable damage in rats. Exposure of male and female mice to 1950 mg/cu m (700 ppm) isoprene or higher induced haematologic abnormalities and forestomach focal epithelial hyperplasia. In male mice, degeneration of the nasal cavity (olfactory epithelium) was noted following exposure to 19503 mg/cu m (7000 ppm) isoprene.

The potential for isoprene to cause developmental toxicity was assessed in rodents, by exposing 4 groups each of Sprague-Dawley rats & Swiss (CD-1) mice to 0, 280, 1,400, or 7,000 ppm isoprene vapors, 6 hr/day, 7 days/wk. Each treatment group consisted of 10 virgin females (for comparison), & ~30 positively mated rats or mice. Positively mated mice were exposed on days 6-17 of gestation (dg), & rats on 6-19 /day of gestation/. The day of plug or sperm detection was designated as 0 /day of gestation/. Body weights were obtained throughout the study period, & uterine & fetal body weights were obtained at sacrifice (rats, 20 /day of gestation/; mice, 18 /day of gestation/). Implants were enumerated & their status recorded. Live fetuses were sexed & examined for gross, visceral, skeletal, & soft-tissue craniofacial defects. Exposure of pregnant rats to these concns of isoprene did not result in apparent maternal toxicity or in developmental toxicity. There were no treatment-related effects upon body weights or reproductive indices at any exposure level, nor was there a significant incr in the incidence of fetal malformations or variations. The only effect observed in the dams was an increased kidney to body weight ratio, & in the fetuses there was a slight, but not statistically significant, exposure-correlated incr in the incidence of reduced vertebral ossifications (centra) which suggests that the 7,000-ppm exposure level may be at or near a developmental toxicity threshold. Exposure of Swiss (CD-1) mice to isoprene resulted in (from 12 /day of gestation/ onward) significant reductions in maternal body weight, body weight gain during treatment & in uterine weight for the 7,000-ppm group. Since neither the extragestational weight gain of the pregnant dams, nor the body weight gain of the virgin animals was affected, there was an indication of selective developmental toxicity at the 7,000-ppm exposure level. Liver to body weight ratios for pregnant dams were significantly greater than the 0-ppm group for both the 1,400 & 7,000-ppm groups. Kidney to body weight ratios were significantly greater than the 0-ppm group for the 7,000-ppm group. Developmental toxicity was further evident as an exposure-correlated reduction in fetal body weights which was statistically significant at the 280-ppm level (the lowest isoprene level) for female fetuses & at the 1,400-ppm level for male fetuses. However, no embryotoxicity in the form of increased intrauterine death was present at any exposure level. Fetuses of mice exposed to isoprene had an increased incidence of supernumerary ribs which was significantly correlated to increasing exposure concn & was statistically significant for the 7,000-ppm group. Although there was no significant incr in the incidence of malformations, two fetuses with cleft palate were found, one in each of the two highest exposure groups. Cleft palates were not detected in the 0-ppm group. In summary, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats & their offspring appeared to be relatively resistant to the toxic effects of isoprene at the exposure levels employed in this study. Swiss (CD-1) mouse dams exhibited significant toxic effects at the 7,000-ppm level; however, the offspring of the mice exhibited significant signs of toxicity, including reductions in fetal body weight & ossification, at all the exposure concns employed. In light of the above results, the 7,000-ppm isoprene level could be set as a no observable effect level (NOEL) in the Sprague-Dawley (CD) rat for both maternal & developmental toxicity. In the Swiss (CD-1) mouse, a NOEL of 1,400 ppm could be set for maternal toxicity; however, a NOEL based on the results of this study cannot be assigned to the Swiss (CD-1) mouse for developmental toxicity.",

Survival rates and mean body weights of exposed male and female rats were similar to those of the chamber controls throughout the study.  At 3, 6, 12, and 18 months, the concentrations of vinyl lactic acid normalized to creatinine in the urine increased with increasing exposure concentration in all exposed groups of male and female rats; however, these increases were not proportional to isoprene exposure concentrations, indicating nonlinear metabolism over this range of exposure concentrations. Exposure-related increases in the incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma were observed in male rats in all groups. The incidences of fibroadenoma in 7,000 ppm males and in all groups of exposed females were significantly greater than those in the chamber control groups. The incidences of fibroadenoma in all exposed groups of males and females and of multiple fibroadenoma in 7,000 ppm males and in all groups of exposed females exceeded the historical control ranges. In addition, the finding of mammary gland carcinoma in exposed male rats was noteworthy because this neoplasm rarely occurs in control male rats. The incidences of renal tubule adenoma in 700 and 7,000 ppm males and of renal tubule hyperplasia in 7,000 ppm males were significantly greater than those in the chamber controls. The severity of kidney nephropathy was slightly increased in 7,000 ppm males when compared to chamber controls. An exposure-related increase in the incidences of interstitial cell adenoma of the testis was observed in male rats. The incidences of bilateral interstitial cell adenoma and of unilateral and bilateral interstitial cell adenoma (combined) of the testis in 700 and 7,000 ppm males were significantly greater than those in the chamber controls. The incidences of interstitial cell adenoma in 700 and 7,000 ppm males exceeded the historical control range. Several rare neoplasms including benign astrocytoma, malignant glioma, malignant medulloblastoma, benign meningeal granular cell tumor, and meningeal sarcoma were observed in the brain of exposed female rats. These neoplasms have seldom or never occurred in historical chamber controls. The incidences of splenic fibrosis in 700 and 7,000 ppm males were significantly greater than that in the chamber control group ... Under the conditions of this 2-year inhalation study, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoprene in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenoma and carcinoma, renal tubule adenoma, and testicular interstitial cell adenoma. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of isoprene in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences and multiplicity of mammary gland fibroadenoma. A low incidence of rare brain neoplasms in exposed female rats may have been due to exposure to isoprene. Exposure to isoprene by inhalation for 2 years resulted in increased incidences of renal tubule hyperplasia and splenic fibrosis in male rats.",

Isoprene is a biogenic chemical emitted from several tree and plant species and has been detected in emissions occurring at the surface of ocean water. Isoprene was found to be the main endogenous hydrocarbon of human breath. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 550 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isoprene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isoprene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone, and nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 3.8, 19, and 1.2 hours, respectively. Isoprene absorbs light with a UV maximum of approximately 237 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight since sunlight consists of wavelengths greater than 290 nm. If released to soil, isoprene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 125. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.7X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Isoprene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Closed Bottle and Manometric Respirometry Tests, 60% and 53-75% of theoretical BOD, respectively was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process soil and water. If released into water, isoprene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.3 days, respectively. A BCF range of <5.6-20 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to isoprene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isoprene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isoprene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with essential oils and consumer products containing isoprene.

Volatilization of isoprene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.7X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 550 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 642 mg/L(5). Isoprene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). A 60% of theoretical BOD using an adapted domestic sewage sludge in the Closed Bottle test and 53-75% of theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Manometric Respirometry Test(6), suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.7X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 550 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 642 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.3 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF range of <5.6-20 measured in carp(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 60% of theoretical BOD using an adapted domestic sewage sludge in the Closed Bottle test and 53-75% of theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum in the Manometric Respirometry Test(9), suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase isoprene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.8 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.01X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Isoprene will also be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and nitrate radical, the reaction half-lives for these reactions are 19 and 1.2 hours, calculated from reaction rates of 1.43X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec(4) and 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(5), respectively. Isoprene absorbs light with a UV maximum of approximately 237 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight since sunlight consists of wavelengths greater than 290 nm(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.8 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of isoprene with ozone is 1.43X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 19 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of isoprene with nitrate radicals is 6.78X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.2 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(4). Based on experimental data for the reaction of isoprene with nitrate radicals, the lifetime for isoprene at nighttime can be estimated to be 216 min and 22 min under clean and moderately polluted atmospheric conditions, respectively(5). Isoprene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6). Isoprene absorbs light with a UV maximum of approximately 237 nm(7) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Isoprene has been detected at concentrations of approximately 2.7, 2.75, 1.5, 2.5 and 2.55 ppb above the Guyana rain forest at distances about 370, 343, 300, 270, 218 km, respectively, from the Atlantic ocean; however, concentrations fall to undetectable over the ocean(1). Isoprene was detected in 5 of 6 samples taken in the ambient air of Rio Blanco County, CO on July 24 and 25, 1978 at concentrations ranging from 0.1-5.6 ppb(2). Isoprene has been detected at concentrations of 4.2, 3.5, 5.7, 4.9, 0.7 and 3.6 ppb in 7 of 9 samples taken from the Smokey Mountains in Tennessee on September 25 and 26, 1978(2). Isoprene has been detected at concentrations of 1.2 and 0.4 ppb in the ambient air above Jones State Forest north of Houston, TX in January 1978(3). The average daily outdoor concentration for isoprene was reported as 0.608 ppb(4). Isoprene has been detected at concentrations ranging from 0.1-13.4 ppb in air samples taken from six locations in northwestern North Carolina from September 1981 to October 1982(5). In a 1-month field study examining ambient gaseous hydrocarbons in the mountains of the Georgian Republic of the USSR in July 1979, isoprene was detected at 7-30 ppb(6). Isoprene was detected in the Balbina forest, Amazonia in samples taken March and April 1998 at concentrations of 2-10 ppb(7). Isoprene was found in Taenikon, Switzerland throughout 1997 at concentrations of 0.1-0.15 ppb, 0-0.1 ppb are believed to be from biogenic sources(8). Samples taken July 6-8, 2000 in Tapajos, Brazil had maximum concentrations of isoprene of 5 ppb(9). Isoprene was detected in 21, 24, and 11% of the total biogenic emissions in Valley, Middle, and Peak Stations, in samples taken in Achenkirch, Tyrol, Austria, June 14, 1996(10).",

Environmental tobacco smoke was analyzed after smoking of research cigarettes by a machine in an experimental chamber 13.6 cu m in volume. The ventilation rate was 3.55 air changes per hr. Air removed for sampling added about 0.5 air changes per hr. One cigarette was lit every 30 min and was smoked with a 35 ml puff of 2 sec every minute until extinguished after about 12 min. Mainstream smoke was vented to the outside of the chamber. Additional tests were performed with one cigarette smoked every 15 min and with several commercial cigarette brands. Isoprene (ug/cu m) was detected in air samples at the following levels: 2 to 11, background; 128, grab samples at peak concentration with smoking 1 cigarette every 30 min; 92, continuous sampling with smoking 1 cigarette every 15 min; 225, continuous sampling with smoking 1 cigarette every 20 min. The average airborne yield for isoprene from cigarette smoke has been estimated to be 3,100 ug/cigarette. Concentration of isoprene using commercial brands of cigarettes in the chamber and in a tavern setting were similar to those produced by the research cigarettes(2). Isoprene was detected in tobacco smoke at a concentration of 360 ug/cu m(3).",

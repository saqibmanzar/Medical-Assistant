When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The total daily amt of phenobarbital then is administered as a single dose or in 3 or 4 divided doses, not to exceed 600 mg/day. If signs of withdrawal occur on the first day of treatment, a loading dose of 100 to 200 mg of phenobarbital may be administered intramuscularly in addition to the oral dose. After stabilization on phenobarbital, the total daily dose is decreased by 30 mg/day as long as withdrawal is proceeding smoothly. This regimen may be modified by initiating treatment at the patient's regular dosage level and decreasing the daily dosage by 10% if tolerated by the patient. 3) For infants physically dependent on barbiturates, initially a dose of 3 to 10 mg of phenobarbital/kg bw/day may be given. After withdrawal symptoms (hyperactivity, disturbed sleep, tremors, hyperreflexia) are relieved, the dosage of phenobarbital should be gradually decreased and completely withdrawn over a 2-wk period. 4) Also, barbiturate withdrawal may be accomplished with benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. /Barbiturates/",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Activated charcoal should be left in the stomach and a saline cathartic may be administered. To enhance elimination - If renal function is normal, forced diuresis may help to eliminate the barbiturate. Alkalinization of the urine increases renal excretion of some barbiturates, especially phenobarbital, also aprobarbital, and mephobarbital (which is metabolized to phenobarbital). Although hemodialysis or hemoperfusion is not recommended as a routine procedure, it may be used in severe barbiturate poisoning or if the patient is anuric or in shock. Monitoring - Vital signs and fluid balance should be monitored. Supportive care - An adequate airway should be maintained, with assisted respiration and administration of oxygen as needed. Blood pressure and body temperature should be maintained. Fluid therapy and other standard treatment for shock should be administered, if necessary. A vasopressor may be required if hypotension occurs. Fluid or sodium overload should be avoided, especially if cardiovascular status is decreased. Chest physiotherapy should be administered. If pneumonia is suspected, appropriate cultures should be taken and antibiotics should be administered. Also, appropriate care should be taken to prevent hypostatic pneumonia, decubiti, aspiration, and other complications that may occur with altered states of consciousness. Patients in whom intentional overdose is known or suspected should be referred for psychiatric consultation. /Barbiturates/",

Secobarbital 2.0 mg/kg intravenously caused a significant (P < .05) decrease in arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), peaking at 10 minutes (n = 10; mean age, 23.4 years). Morphine, 0.2 mg/kg intravenously also caused a significant decrease in PaO2 at 5 minutes (n = 10; mean age, 26.3 years). The combination of the same doses of morphine and secobarbital caused a significantly (P < .01) greater decrease in PaO2 at 5 and 10 minutes than the sole administration of either drug (n = 10; mean age, 23.5 years). Arterial oxygen pressure remained significantly (P < .05) reduced for 30 minutes. Although the PaCO2 increases after secobarbital and morphine did not reach statistical significance, their combination caused a significant (P < .05) increase in PaCO2. Both secobarbital and morphine alone caused significant (P < .05) decrease in pHa at 30 minutes. Their combination caused a significant (P < .01) reduction in pHa from 5 minutes until 60 minutes. In conclusion, both secobarbital and morphine alone caused ventilatory depression. The duration of ventilatory depression was greater with the intravenous combination than with either drug alone.",

Sixty minutes prior to experimental sessions, male subjects were administered either placebo or 50, 100 or 200 mg per 70 kg of body weight doses of secobarbital double-blind. During these sessions, subjects could press a button to accumulate points exchangeable for money (non-aggressive response) or press another button ostensibly to subtract points from a fictitious person (aggressive response). Aggressive responding was occasioned by subtracting points from the subject. Subjects were instructed that points were subtracted by another person. Aggressive responding was maintained by contingent presentation of periods free of point subtractions, ie, provocations. Acute secobarbital administration produced dose-dependent decreases in non-aggressive responding, and increases in aggressive responding.",

The barbiturates were administered in the diet at concentrations equimolar to 500 p.p.m. of the known liver tumor promoter phenobarbital, which served as the positive control for this study. Phenobarbital, which has the longest duration of sedative action of this series of compounds, caused the greatest induction of CYP2B activity, and displayed strong liver tumor promoting effects. Allobarbital and aprobarbital, two intermediate-duration sedatives, were found to promote hepatocarcinogenesis, with allobarbital proving to be as effective as phenobarbital in this respect and aprobarbital being somewhat weaker as a promoter. These intermediate-duration sedatives were each relatively weak CYP2B-type inducers, causing approximately 25% of the induction displayed by phenobarbital. The nonsedatives, 5-phenyl- and 5-ethyl-barbituric acids, were essentially inactive as CYP2B-type inducers and were also found to be relatively inactive as promoters of hepatocarcinogenesis. Of the shorter-duration sedatives, pentobarbital was found to promote, and was relatively effective as a CYP2B-type inducer, while secobarbital showed little or no promoting activity and was less effective as an inducer of CYP2B activities. Pentobarbital thus proved an important exception to /the/ hypothesis that only long-acting sedative barbiturates would promote hepatocarcinogenesis. ...",

Plasma was collected prior to treatment and 18 hours later (75 mg) or 8 and 15 days later (20 mg). Plasma was analyzed for the platelet count (PLT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen (FIB), and coagulation factor activities for factors II, V, VII, IX, and X. Treatment with a single subcutaneous injection of 75 mg of secobarbital caused statistically significant alterations in every clotting activity measured whereas 7 days of treatment with 20 mg once daily resulted in only 2 clotting factors being abnormal. These two factors returned to pretreatment levels following 7 days of withdrawal of secobarbital. The data indicates that a single larger dose of secobarbital is more influential on hepatic synthesized clotting factor activity than is longer treatment with a lesser dose.",

Barbiturates are bound to plasma and tissue proteins to a varying degree, with the degree of binding increasing directly as a function of lipid solubility.  Phenobarbital has the lowest lipid solubility, lowest plasma binding, lowest brain protein binding, the longest delay in onset of activity, and the longest duration of action. At the opposite extreme is secobarbital, which has the highest lipid solubility, highest plasma protein binding, highest brain protein binding, the shortest delay in onset of activity, and the shortest duration of action.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

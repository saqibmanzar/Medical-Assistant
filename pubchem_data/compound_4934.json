This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Data on food & water consumption, body weights, & clinical signs during a 2 wk dose-range-finding study (Task 1) were used to set exposure concns for the Task 2 continuous cohabitation study at 0.0, 0.05, 0.16, & 0.5% in feed. Based on mean body weight & avg feed consumption data, the estimated daily doses were 71, 235, & 760 mg/kg bw. In the F0 animals, there were no deaths during Task 2. Body weight gain for the top dose males was reduced by a factor of 4, compared to controls. There was a statistically significant, but small (6%) reduction in the number of litters/pair at the top dose. The only other changes in reproductive indices for the F0 pairs occurred at the high dose level, & were a reduction in the mean weight of F1 pups adjusted for litter size at the top dose, by 4%, & an incr in the length of time to deliver each litter. This delay was greatest for the first 3 litters, while the difference was less for the last 2 litters. These modest reproductive effects (6% decr in litters/pair, & 4% decr in adjusted live pup weight) were considered too small to be detectable in the single litter generated by the Task 3 crossover, so Task 3 was not conducted. There were no adverse effects of PB consumption on the growth or viability of the F1 offspring in the last litter that was reared for second generation testing. After weaning the F2 mice, the F1 mice from control, middle & high dose groups were killed & necropsied. There were no weight changes or gross lesions noted in females, while male body weights were reduced by 11% at the top dose. There were no changes in sperm indices or in estrous cycle parameters. Only mice from the control & high dose groups were kept & treated with PB from weaning to the mating trial at /postnatal day/ 74 +/- 10. Compared to controls, the high dose PB mice had similar-sized litters, with the same proportion of live pups, & same sex ratio, but the adjusted live pup weight was reduced by 11%. After the delivery & evaluation of the F2 litters & estrous cycle data collection, the F1 adults were killed & necropsied. There was an 8% reduction in female body weight, & no change in organ weights. For males, body weight was reduced by 10%, & prostate weight was reduced by 25%. Epididymal sperm density was reduced at the high dose by 15%, while estrous cycle length & characteristics were unchanged. Thus, propantheline bromide caused detectable but small reductions in litter number, in both generations reduced adjusted pup weight, & reduced F1 prostate weight & sperm count. These effects were seen concomitant with male body weight changes but no other significant non-reproductive toxicities. /Propantheline bromide/",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Metabolite characterization of the 24-48 hour urinary samples (pooled by sex) and quantitation of urinary samples collected at 0-24, 24-48, and 48-54 hours and pooled by sex were performed using liquid scintillation counting, silica gel column chromatography, TLC, HPLC, NMR, and mass spectroscopy. The objective of this study was to identify the urinary metabolites of trifluralin. There was no sex-dependent effect on metabolic profiles. A minimum of 20-30 non-conjugated metabolites and an additional 10-20 conjugated metabolites were present in the urine, but no parent compound was detected. Information on the percentage of the administered dose excreted in the urine was not provided. However, no single metabolite accounted for more than 8-10% of the total urinary radioactivity, and the majority of the metabolites were present at 1-2% of the total urinary radioactivity. Thus, almost all of the metabolites were minor (<5% of the total radioactive dose). Metabolite F1B was found at 8.2-8.9% of the total urinary radioactivity in both sexes, and Metabolite F2, N-((3-(acetylamino)-2-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)) phenyl)acetamide, was found at 4.0-5.2%. Metabolite F1B was partially characterized as retaining the trifluoromethyl groups, the two equivalent aromatic protons, and the two nitro groups, but the propyl groups were lost. Ten other metabolites were identified (<0.1-3.7% of total urinary radioactivity, each compound in each sex). Two additional metabolites were partially characterized (0.1-2.6% of total urinary radioactivity, each compound in each sex). Four metabolic pathways were identified as follows: (i) oxidative N-dealkylation of one or both propyl groups and metabolites which were hydroxylated on the propyl side chain; (ii) reduction of one or both nitro groups to the corresponding amine; (iii) cyclization reactions to give a variety of substituted and unsubstituted benzimidazole metabolites; and (iv) conjugation reactions, including acetylation of the reduced nitro groups, sulfate, and glucuronic acid conjugates.",

No information is available on the acute (short-term), chronic (long- term), reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of trifluralin in humans. Decreased weight gain and effects on the blood and liver were observed in dogs chronically exposed to trifluralin in their diet. Skeletal abnormalities and depressed fetal weight were observed in the offspring of rodents exposed via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach). Increased incidences of urinary tract tumors and thyroid tumors were observed in rats exposed to trifluralin in their diet. Trifluralin did not produce statistically significant increases in tumors in other studies. EPA has classified trifluralin as a Group C, possible human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent).",

Management depends on: (1) the best estimate of the quantity ingested, (2) time elapsed since ingestion, and (3) the clinical status of the subject. Activated charcoal is probably effective in limiting irritant effects and reducing absorption of most or all of these herbicides. Aluminum hydroxide antacids may be useful in neutralizing the irritant actions of more acidic agents. Sorbitol should be given to induce catharsis if bowel sounds are present and if diarrhea has not already commenced. Dehydration and electrolyte may be severe enough to require oral or intravenous fluids. There are no specific antidotes for poisoning by these herbicides. In the case of suicidal ingestions, particularly, the possibility must always be kept in mind that multiple toxic substances may have been swallowed. If large amounts of herbicide have been ingested and the patient is seen an hour of the ingestion, gastrointestinal decontamination should be considered. If the amount of ingested herbicides was small, if effective emesis has already occurred, or if treatment is delayed, administer activated charcoal and sorbitol mouth. /Herbicides/",

Studies were identified from the AHS publication list ... as well as through a Medline/PubMed database search in March 2009. /The authors/ also examined citation lists. Findings related to lifetime-days and/or intensity-weighted lifetime-days of pesticide use are the primary focus of this review, because these measures allow for the evaluation of potential exposure-response relationships. /Investigators/ reviewed 28 studies; most of the 32 pesticides examined were not strongly associated with cancer incidence in pesticide applicators. Increased rate ratios (or odds ratios) and positive exposure-response patterns were reported for 12 pesticides currently registered in Canada and/or the United States (alachlor, aldicarb, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, dicamba, S-ethyl-N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate, imazethapyr, metolachlor, pendimethalin, permethrin, trifluralin). However, estimates of association for specific cancers were often imprecise because of small numbers of exposed cases, and clear monotonic exposure-response patterns were not always apparent. Exposure misclassification is also a concern in the AHS and may limit the analysis of exposure-response patterns. Epidemiologic evidence outside the AHS remains limited with respect to most of the observed associations, but animal toxicity data support the biological plausibility of relationships observed for alachlor, carbaryl, metolachlor, pendimethalin, permethrin, and trifluralin.",

The association between trifluralin use and common cancer incidence was evaluated among 50,127 private and commercial pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a prospective cohort study of licensed pesticide applicators and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina. Poisson regression was used to examine internal dose-response relationships, while controlling for important lifestyle factors and other agricultural exposures. Two metrics of exposure (lifetime days and intensity-weighted lifetime days) were used in exposure-response analyses with non-exposed applicators, as well as applicators in the lowest tertile of exposure, as reference groups. Incident cancers were identified through state tumor registries from enrollment in 1993 through 2002. Trifluralin exposure was not associated with cancer incidence overall among 51% of private and commercial applicators (n=25,712) who had used trifluralin. However, there was an excess of colon cancer in the exposure category of higher half of highest tertile (rate ratios (RR) of 1.76 (95% CI=1.05-2.95) using the non-exposed as a referent and 1.93 (95% CI=1.08-3.45) using those with the lowest tertile of exposure as the referent). There was also a non-significantly elevated risk for kidney cancer and bladder cancer in the highest exposure group, although only the kidney cancer finding was consistent across exposure metrics. Although there was a possible link between trifluralin exposure and colon cancer, small numbers and inconsistencies in dose-response and subgroup analyses indicate that this may be a chance finding.",

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of trifluralin on the urinary tract of male rats. All animals survived until the scheduled sacrifice. Food consumption was reduced by 27%, and may have been indicative of a lack in palatability. Additionally, decreases (not statistically significant) in body weight gain (5.4 g treated vs 15.6 g control) and food utilization (2.6 treated vs 6.3 controls) were observed. The treated animals urinated orange-yellow fluid, indicative of the test compound and/or metabolites, resulting in soiled genital areas. During urinalysis, the following observations were made: (i) urine clarity was reduced in the treated animals on days 6 and 13; (ii) triple phosphate crystals were observed in all treated animals and were particularly abundant on days 6 and 13 (vs 3/5 control rats); (iii) amorphous material was found in the urine of treated animals; (iv) LDH and AST were increased at days 6 and 13; on day 13 the increase was 84% for LDH and 205% for AST; (v) mildly increased protein concentrations were observed on days 6 and 13. Cytoplasmic hyaline droplet formation in many renal cortical tubules of each treated animal indicated epithelial degeneration (vs 0/5 controls).",

The rats (n=10, except n=15 in controls and 0.05% group) were sacrificed at 30, 60, and 90 days. At 0 and 50 ppm, 45 rats were treated, and 30 rats were treated in each of the other doses. The rats (n=10-15) were sacrificed at 30, 60, and 90 days. Additionally, a satellite group of 15 rats at 0 and 50 ppm and 10 rats in each of the other doses was treated for 4 months, followed by 6 weeks of maintenance on the control diet. All satellite study animals were sacrificed on day 171. Body weight, body weight gain, food consumption, food efficiency, gross pathology, and histopathology of the kidney and urinary bladder were evaluated. Measurements of numerous parameters were made during urine chemistry and protein electrophoresis of the urine. No treatment-related adverse effects were observed on mortality, clinical signs, body weight, or body weight gain through month 3; after 4 months of treatment, there was a significant decrease in body weight, body weight gain and food utilization at >= 3200 ppm. Urine was discolored by the dinitroaniline compound at 3200 and 6400 ppm. No effect was observed in the 50 ppm group. Recovery was evident following 6 weeks of maintenance on the control diet in all groups, but was incomplete in the 6400 ppm group. There was a dose related increase (>= 200 ppm) in the incidence of intra-cytoplasmic hyaline droplet formation in the renal cortical tubular epithelial cells (minimal to moderate severity) and an increase in urine alpha1-globulin and alpha2-globulin (all biochemical indicators of kidney toxicity). In the >=800 ppm groups, significant increases of 73-489% in urinary total protein, AST, and LDH and in the urinary volume (38-89%) were observed. In the 6400 ppm group, increases of 27-169% in urinary calcium and sodium were observed. The LOAEL for nephrotoxicity is 800 ppm (40.1 mg/kg/day), based on the presence of tubular cytoplasmic hyaline droplets; increased total protein, AST, and LDH in the urine; albumin alpha1-globulin and alpha2-globulin observed by urine electrophoresis; and increased urinary volume. The NOAEL is 200 ppm (10.1mg/kg/day).",

Ten rats/sex/dose were sacrificed at the end of the 3-month treatment period, and the remaining 10 rats/sex/dose were sacrificed after a 15-day recovery period in which they were given control diets. In the main study, there were no effects of treatment on mortality, clinical observations, ophthalmology, gross pathology, or histopathology. There were no adverse effects on urinalysis. In the recovery group, urine color returned to normal; otherwise, findings (when reported) were similar to the main study. Absolute and relative (to body) liver weights were dose-dependently increased in females dosed at 800 ppm and higher (11-48%) and in males dosed at 2000 ppm and higher (28-48%). On day 93, blood serum phosphate was dose-dependently increased in all female dose groups (21-29%) and in the 2000 and 5000 ppm males (35-41%). Additionally at 5000 ppm, overall body weight gains were decreased 9% each in males and females compared to controls. Food consumption was decreased 16-18% on day 8 in males and females and remained decreased 10% on day 92 in females. Similarly, relative (to body) food consumption was decreased on day 8 in males and females (10.38-10.48% treated vs 11.64-12.08% controls) and remained decreased on day 92 in females (6.79% treated vs 7.10% controls).

Analysis of the technical product established the presence of 84 to 88 ppm dipropylnitrosamine. The product was admin in the feed, at either of two concn, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals of each species. 50 animals of each sex were placed on test as controls for the rat bioassay, while 20 of each sex were utilized as controls on the mouse study. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concentrations of trifluralin were, respectively, 8,000 and 4,125 ppm for male rats, 7,917 and 4,125 ppm for female rats, 3,744 and 2,000 ppm for male mice, and 5,192 and 2,740 ppm for female mice. After a 78 wk treatment period, there was an additional observation period of 33 wk for rats and 12 wk for mice. For female mice the association between incr dosage and elevated incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was significant (0/20, 12/47, and 21/44 of the control, low dose, and high dose, respectively) as was the relationship between dose and incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas. Significance of incidence for both types of tumors was supported by tests for significance at each dose level. Squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach were observed in dosed female mice, but not in controls. Although incidences of these tumors were not statistically significant, they are unusual lesions in B6C3F1 mice and are considered treatment related. Neoplasms observed in treated rats were types that have occurred spontaneously in this strain and were apparently unrelated to trifluralin treatment. Evaluation of the results of this bioassay, technical grade trifluralin is a carcinogen in female B6C3F1 mice, being associated with incr incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach. Sufficient evidence was not provided for the carcinogenicity or tumorigenicity of trifluralin in male B6C3F1 mice or Osborne-Mendel rats. Evaluation of the results of this bioassay indicates that technical grade trifluralin is a carcinogen in female B6C3F1 mice, being associated in these animals with an elevated incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach.

In the present study, /the authors/ investigated the acute effects of five agricultural pesticides on juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) olfaction using the electro-olfactogram (EOG), a measure of odorant-evoked field potentials. Electro-olfactogram responses to the odorant L-serine were measured during and following a 30-min exposure of the left olfactory rosette to chlorothalonil, endosulfan, glyphosate acid, iodocarb (IPBC), trifluralin, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. With the relatively insoluble pesticides endosulfan and trifluralin, decreases in EOG amplitude were only apparent at relatively high concentrations (100 and 300 ug/L, respectively) following 20 min of exposure and were absent for chlorothalonil (1 mg/L). With the water-soluble herbicide glyphosate, significant EOG reductions occurred within 10 min of exposure to 1 mg/L and more rapidly with higher concentrations. Recovery of EOG post-glyphosate exposure was concentration-dependent, and complete recovery was not observed with some concentrations at 60 min postexposure. Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid only affected EOG at high concentration (100 mg/L), where it eliminated EOG within 2 min of exposure. With IPBC, EOG was decreased at 25 min of exposure to 1 ug/L; higher concentrations caused decreases to occur more rapidly. Excluding IPBC and glyphosate, all EOG reductions occurred at concentrations greater than the current Canadian water-quality guidelines and reported 96-hr lethality values. ...Results show that olfactory neurons can be impaired rapidly by some current-use pesticides, even at exposures in the low-ug/L range.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.58X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trifluralin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase triflualin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Trifluralin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and the observed half-life for trifluralin in July sunlight ranged from 19-74 min. In the presence of ozone, the rate of this reaction increases. Particulate-phase trifluralin may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, trifluralin is expected to have moderate to no mobility based upon Koc values of 397 to 27,900. Trifluralin volatilized 16%, 28% and 40% in dry, moist and flooded soils over a 32 day incubation period. Sunlight photolysis of trifluralin adsorbed to soil TLC plate resulted in 18.4% removal in 7 days although in the field, direct photolysis on soil surfaces does not appear to compete with volatilization. Trifluralin biodegrades faster in anaerobic soils than in aerobic soils with anaerobic half-lives of 22-59 days and aerobic half-lives of 116-202 days. If released into water, trifluralin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Biodegradation is not expected to be important based upon rapid photolysis of trifluralin from surface waters with an experimental half-life of 22 minutes. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 1.03X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 21 hours and 12 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Experimental BCFs of 1689 to 9586 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to trifluralin may occur by inhalation or dermal contact during its production, formulation, or application as a herbicide. The general population may be exposed to trifluralin by dermal and inhalation routes from lawn products and by ingestion of contaminated agricultural products or the ingestion of fish caught in contaminated waters.

Volatilization of trifluralin from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.03X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(9). Trifluralin is shown to volatilize from both moist and dry soils to the atmosphere(10-12), although the volatilization rate is greater for moist soils(13). Trifluralin was volatilized 16%, 28% and 40% in dry, moist and flooded soils over a 32 day incubation period(10). Sunlight photolysis of trifluralin adsorbed to soil TLC plate resulted in 18.4% removal in 7 days(14) although in the field, direct photolysis on soil surfaces does not appear to compete with volatilization(13,15). Trifluralin biodegrades faster in anaerobic soils than in aerobic soils(16). Trifluralin degraded with half-lives of 189, 202, and 116 days in sandy loam, clay loam, and loam soils, respectively, when incubated aerobically in the dark at 22 \u00b0C for 364 days(17). Trifluralin degraded with half-lives of 22-59 days in sandy loam, loam, and clay loam soils incubated anaerobically in the dark at 22 \u00b0C for 60 days following an aerobic incubation period of 30 days(17).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(9) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.03X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(10). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(9), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 21 hours and 12 days, respectively(SRC). The volatilization from a model pond is about 30 months when adsorption is considered(11). According to a classification scheme(12), measured BCF of 1289 to 9586(13-16), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Trifluralin is stable to hydrolysis(17). The experimental half-life for the direct photolysis of trifluralin in near surface water, latitude 40 deg N in the summer is 22 min(18). Biodegradation of trifluralin is not important based on the rapid photodegradation(18).",

Vapor-phase trifluralin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.4X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase trifluralin may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Trifluralin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and the observed half-life for trifluralin in July sunlight ranged from 19-74 min(5). In the presence of ozone, the rate of this reaction increases(6-7).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Trifluralin degraded with half-lives of 189, 202, and 116 days in sandy loam, clay loam, and loam soils, respectively, when incubated aerobically in the dark at 22 \u00b0C for 364 days(2). Seven degradates of trifluralin have been identified: alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-2,6,-dinitro-N-propyl-p-toluidine; alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-5-nitro-4-propyl-toluene-3,4-diamine; 2-ethyl-7-nitro-1-propyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzimidazole-3-oxide; 2-ethyl-7-nitro-1-propyl-5-(trifluoromethyl) benzimidazole; 2-ethyl-7-nitro-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzimidazole; alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-p-cresol; 2,2'-azoybis(alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-6-nitro-N-propyl-p-toluidine(2). These degradates were identified in test samples at maximum concentrations (% applied radioactivity) of 2.8-4.6%, 1.5-2.1%, 0.1-0.3%, 0.5-1.0%, 2.1-2.6%, 0.1-2.7%, and 0.8-3.0%, respectively(2). During the testing period of about one year, trifluralin parent declined to less than 25% of applied radioactivity in all soils(2). At the same time volatile and unextractable residues increased to 22% and about 45% of applied radioactivity(2). In another laboratory study, the estimated half-life for the biodegradation of 1,000 ppm trifluralin in soil was 405 days under aerobic conditions(3). Trifluralin, which was added to soil obtained from a pesticide disposal site, did not biodegrade in 157 days under aerobic conditions(4). Aerobic biodegradation of trifluralin proceeds through an initial dealkylation followed by reduction of the nitro groups(5). The trifluoromethyl group of trifluralin appears to remain intact in all major metabolites and is eventually oxidized to the carboxylic acid(6). In a 14-day environmental chamber study with a 14 hr photoperiod, degradation of 10 ppm trifluralin, present as a mixture with metolachlor and atrazine, was shown to occur in non-vegetated soil (47% degradation) but not to the extent of the Kochia scoparia rhizosphere soil (70% degradation), suggesting that the rhizosphere of certain plant species may facilitate microbial degradation(7). Incubation of radio-labled trifluralin with sediment samples under aerobic conditions resulted in a concentration reduction equal to 25% its original value after 10 days; the microbial community was not found to adapt to trifluralin(8). Trifluralin at an initial concentration of 100 ug/L underwent 49% removal when incubated with primary sewage effluent under aerobic conditions(9).",

The major degradates identified were: alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-5-nitro-N4,N4-dipropyl-toluene-3,4-diamine (which reached a maximum concentration of 5.4% and 13.2% of the applied radioactivity in sandy loam soil and clay loam soil, respectively, at Day 60 following flooding, and 11.6% in the loam soil at Day 30 following flooding); 7-amino-2-ethyl-1-propyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzimidazole (which reached 7.3% in sandy loam soil and 8.3% in loam and clay loam soils at Day 60 following flooding); alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-N4-N4-dipropyltoluene-3,4,5-triamine (which reached 0.3% in sandy loam soil, 4.1% in loam soil, and 2.6% in clay loam soil)(2). In another laboratory study, the estimated half-life for the biodegradation of 1,000 ppm trifluralin in soil was 211 days under anaerobic conditions(3). Degradation under anaerobic conditions initiates with nitro group reduction followed by dealkylation(4).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 16 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Trifluralin underwent approx 10-15% loss when soil TLC plates incorporated with the pesticide were exposed to the July sun for 6 days(2). Sunlight photolysis of trifluralin adsorbed to soil TLC plate resulted in 18.4% removal in 7 days(3), although in the field it is not believed that direct photolysis on the soil surface can compete with volatilization(4-5). No change in the loss rate of trifluralin from soil was observed with changing pH, indicating that pH dependent hydrolysis was not occurring(6). Photodecomposition of trifluralin in water leads to the formation of highly polar products via N-dealkylation, nitro reduction and cyclization(7). Photolysis of water suspensions of trifluralin under summer sunlight leads to the formation of mono and di-dealkylated products, the corresponding benzimidazole and its N-oxide and the corresponding phenol(8). The experimental half-life for the direct photolysis of trifluralin in near surface water, latitude 40 deg N in the summer is 22 min(9). In both laboratory and field gas-phase photolysis studies the same products were produced(10-11). The half-life for the gas-phase photolysis of trifluralin in the laboratory was one hour(12). The observed vapor-phase half-life for trifluralin when irradiated by July sunlight ranged from 25-60 min(13). Vapor-phase photolysis rates for trifluralin were determined by sunlight irradiation; half-lives were found to range from 19 to 74 minutes(13). Simultaneous irradiation of methanolic solutions produced half-lives of 17 to 25 min(13). Trifluralin was found to photodegrade to 50% of applied concentration after 30 min irradiation to light of wavelengths above 290 nm(14). The rate of the gas-phase photolysis of trifluralin was found to increase in the presence of ozone(15). Trifluralin is stable to hydrolysis(16).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(8), this range of Koc values suggests trifluralin is expected to be moderately mobile to immobile in soil. An experimental adsorption coefficient of 30,550 was determined for trifluralin using Georgia pond sediment(9). Trifluralin was immobile in soil TLC experiments using 14 different soils that ranged from sandy loam to silty clay(10). In a laboratory screening study, trifluralin did not leach past 30 cm in 100 days(11-12). It was estimated that it would take 1580 yrs for trifluralin to leach through soil to a depth of 3 meters(12).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that trifluralin is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 21 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 12 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 30 months when adsorption is considered(3). Trifluralin's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). In a laboratory study, trifluralin underwent 24% volatilization loss from a Lakeland soil in 3 hours; the rate of volatilization increased with increasing soil moisture(4). Volatilization losses for trifluralin amounted to approx 16% after 32 days in dry soil, approx 28% loss in moist soil and 40% loss in flooded soil(5). In an ecosystem model mimicking a Northern prairie wetland, trifluralin underwent approx 15% loss due to volatilization in 42 days(6). In a laboratory study, trifluralin underwent 5% evaporative losses in 10 days when incorporated to 10 cm depth in soil samples(7). The measured rate for volatilization of trifluralin from nonadsorbent sand was 3 kg/ha/day(8). Experimental volatilization half-lives for trifluralin were reported with a median of 0.82 days(9).",

Trifluralin was detected in 1 of 1443 wells monitored in Nebraska, at a concentration of 0.42 ppb(2). In a survey of U.S. groundwater quality, trifluralin was detected in samples from Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, and Nebraska as a result of normal use at a maximum and mean concentration of 2.20 ppb and 0.40 ppb, respectively(3). Trifluralin was detected in North Dakota as a result of a point source contamination at 0.03 ppb and in Kansas from unknown origin at a maximum and mean concentration of 5.40 ppb and 3.09 ppb(3). Trifluralin was detected in 3 groundwater samples collected from a small residential community in South-Central Connecticut, the average detected concentration was 0.04 ug/L(4). Trifluralin was detected in groundwater samples at 65% of 28 agrochemical dealership sites in Iowa at a max concentration of 58 ug/L(5). Trifluralin was not detected in 20 orchard and 34 public supply groundwater wells sampled 1993 to 1995 and 2002 to 2003 from the Central Columbia Plateau, WA(6). Trifluralin was not detected in 18 row crop groundwater wells sampled 1993 to 1995 but was detected in one of the same 18 wells tested again 2002 to 2003, detection limits varied and were not reported as this was a trend study(6).",

Trifluralin has been detected in water from Lake Erie and Lake Michigan watersheds(3). Trifluralin's concentration in the Wabash River, 1975, ranged from 3.12 ug/L to 548 ug/L <1 mile from a pesticide manufacturing facility(4). Trifluralin was detected in 1 of 62 lake and river/stream sites sampled from 1989 to 1991 in a 4 county region of Arkansas at a maximum concentration of 1.3 ug/L(5). The concentration of trifluralin in the Shell Creek, NE, 1988, after a spring storm event ranged from trace to 0.5 ug/L(6). Trifluralin was detected at non-detectable to 108.12 ng/L in surface water samples taken at different elevations in California's Sequoia National Park during the summer of 1996(7). Trifluralin was detected in 9.6% of samples taken from the Kisco river with a maximum concentration of 0.0017 ug/L, samples were collected May 2000 to Feb 2001, Kisco river is part of New York City water supply system(8). Five separate collection cruises on the Choptank River, MD were conducted on May 10, June 15, July 24, Aug 29 and Dec 6, 2000, trifluralin was not detected (detection limit 0.17 ng/L)(9). Surface water samples taken from US streams in the Great Lakes basin tested positive for trifluralin in 10.9% of 46 samples taken 1994 to 2000 at concentrations of <0.001 ug/L(10). Trifluralin was detected in 0.5% of 215 samples collected in 8 urban streams sampled in the US at a maximum concentration of 0.011 ug/L(11).

Trifluralin was detected in seven of 96 river water samples taken May 1996 to April 1997 at eight sampling sites in Imathia area of Greece at concentrations of 0.001 (detection limit) to 0.021 ug/L(3). Trifluralin was detected in 3 of 69 samples of natural waters from various regions of Greece, at concentrations ranging from <0.005 to 0.01 ug/L(4). Trifluralin was detected in seawater samples taken from the Bering and Chukchi Seas during the summer of 1993(5). Water samples from Beijing Guanting Reservoir taken at seven locations in Sept and Nov 2003, and June and Aug 2004 contained trifluralin at 3.41 to 5.15 ng/L, pore water samples from the same locations contained trifluralin at not detected to 83.6 ng/L(6). Trifluralin was not detected in 35 surface water sample sites taken at locations throughout Korea in 2002(7). In a European estuaries study, trifluralin was detected in samples from the Scheldt, Louros, Ebro and Rhone rivers at <10 to 11 ng/L, samples were taken Dec 1994 to June 1996(8). Trifluralin was detected in 15 of 18 samples collected from East China Sea to the high Arctic at 0.004-0.22 pg/L, samples were collected July to Sept 2010 aboard the ice-breaker R/V Xuelong(9). Eight surface water sampling sites within the Ebro River Basin, Spain, had reported average trifluralin concentrations of <15 to 16 ng/L, samples were taken in the months of May, June, July and Sept and sampled 2001 to 2004(10).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Multiple honey bee stings may result in venom toxicity, leading to renal failure and even death. Here we tested the efficacy of methyl anthranilate as a honey bee repellent during a massive defensive response by Africanized honey bees. An aerosolized solution of 10% methyl anthranilate reduced the number of defensive bee hits to a retreating victim by 95% compared with a water control. One hundred fifty milliliters of the 10% methyl anthranilate solution sprayed onto stationary foam balls covered with black suede leather located 2 m from provoked Africanized colonies received 80% fewer stings than targets treated with water. Methyl anthranilate (100%) delivered through a UV blocking 3 mil polyethylene pouch was 100% effective in preventing Polistes colonization in wildlife observation huts and from the roof overhang of home patios. Although methyl anthranilate was not 100% effective in preventing honey bee stinging, it seemed to reduce number of stings below the average human LD50, indicative of a promising tool for preventing honey bee venom toxicity and wasp colonization.",

In the case of methyl anthranilate, there is direct experimental evidence showing that this ester, while only slowly hydrolyzed by artificial gastric or pancreatic juice, was readily hydrolyzed in rat liver homogenate (50% in 26.6 minutes) and rapidly hydrolyzed in a homogenate of rat small intestine mucosa (50% in 2.5 minutes). Methyl anthranilate has also been shown to be completely hydrolyzed (>99% in two hours) in pig liver homogenate; but was more resistant to hydrolysis in pig jejunum homogenate and completely unhydrolysed by a pancreatin preparation.  The hydrolysis products of methyl anthranilate are, of course, methyl alcohol and anthranilic acid. Methyl alcohol is readily metabolized via well-known pathways to carbon dioxide and water. Anthranilic acid is a normal metabolite in man and is excreted in the urine, primarily, as o-aminohippuric acid and to a lesser extent as anthranilic acid glucuronide.",

It is used as a non-toxic and non-lethal bird repellent. It is used also in flavorings and perfumes. Although methyl anthranilate was not 100% effective in preventing honey bee stinging, it seemed to reduce number of stings below the average human LD50, indicative of a promising tool for preventing honey bee venom toxicity and wasp colonization. HUMAN STUDIES: Maximization tests were carried out on groups of 24 and 26 volunteers. The material was tested at a 10% concentration in petrolatum and produced no sensitization reactions. It produced no irritation after a 48 hr closed-patch test on human subjects and this result was confirmed when the test was repeated. ANIMAL STUDIES: Methyl anthranilate applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was moderately irritating. Groups of 10 male and 10 female weanling rats were maintained for a period of 115 days on diets containing methyl anthranilate at levels of 0, 3,000 and 10,000 ppm. The only observable effects noted at the 10,000 ppm level were increases in the average weights of the liver and kidneys, and slight (minimal) histological changes in the kidneys. There was no increase in the incidence of primary lung tumors in mice over a period of 24 weeks, that received a total dose of methyl anthranilate of 2.25 or 11.2 g/kg bw (repeated ip injections three times a week for a total of 24 injections). Methyl anthranilate was found to be negative when tested for mutagenicity using the Salmonella/ microsome preincubation assay, Methyl anthranilate was tested in as many as 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100) in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: No treatment-related mortality of catfish was observed. Handling times of catfish fingerlings captured by herons from tubs treated with methyl anthranilate-based bird repellent increased at application rates of 19.6 kg/ha or greater.",

Its use as a perfume and bird repellant will result in its direct release to the environment. Methyl anthranilate is found in several natural essential oils. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.7X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl anthranilate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl anthranilate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hrs. Methyl anthranilate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl anthranilate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 75. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing a soil biodegradation screening test, 100% biodegradation in 64 days of analogous 2-aminobenzoic acid indicates that biodegradation of methyl anthranilate may an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, methyl anthranilate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Methyl anthranilate, present at 50 mg/L, exhibited 100% biodegradation in 20 days when incubated in dechlorinated, charcoal-filtered water, indicating that biodegradation of methyl anthranilate may be an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 24 and 180 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on hydrolysis losses of 0-4, 3-7 and 3-9% at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively, after 38 days. Occupational exposure to methyl anthranilate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl anthranilate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to methyl anthranilate via ingestion of food, using tobacco and dermal contact with and inhalation of consumer products containing methyl anthranilate. (SRC)",

However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group(4,5), suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils(SRC). Volatilization of methyl anthranilate from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.7X10-2 mm Hg(6), and water solubility, 2,850 mg/L(7). Methyl anthranilate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(6). Utilizing a soil biodegradation screening test, 100% biodegradation in 64 days of analogous 2-aminobenzoic acid(8) indicates that biodegradation of methyl anthranilate may be an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.7X10-2 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 2,850 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 24 and 180 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 8(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Methyl anthranilate, present at 50 mg/L, exhibited 100% biodegradation in 20 days when incubated in dechlorinated, charcoal-filtered water(8) indicating that biodegradation of methyl anthranilate may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

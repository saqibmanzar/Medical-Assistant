Median survival time was 224 days (mean 386 days), and median duration of remission was 183 days (mean 323 days). Marked neutropenia was observed following carmustine administration. There were no significant alterations in platelets and red blood cell counts during treatment, and no abnormalities attributable to the chemotherapy were found in serum biochemical profiles. Results of this study showed that carmustine is an effective alternative option in the treatment of canine lymphosarcoma.",

Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of BiCNU.  Since the major toxicity is delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose. At the recommended dosage, courses of BiCNU should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks.  The bone marrow toxicity of BiCNU is cumulative and therefore dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose.  Pulmonary toxicity from BiCNU appears to be dose related. Patients receiving greater than 1400 mg/sq m cumulative dose are at significantly higher risk than those receiving less.  Delayed pulmonary toxicity can occur years after treatment, and can result in death, particularly in patients treated in childhood.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The carmustine contained in the wafer diffuses into the surrounding brain tissue. The metabolism and excretion of the copolymer contained in carmustine wafers has not been evaluated in humans. Animal studies have shown that more than 70% of the copolymer degrades within 3 weeks following implantation of carmustine wafers into brain tissue; following hydrolysis of the copolymer, carboxyphenoxypropane is eliminated renally, while sebacic acid (an endogenous fatty acid) is metabolized in the liver and expired as carbon dioxide. In humans, wafer remnants have been observed on brain imaging scans or located during subsequent surgical procedures up to 8 months following intracranial implantation. Wafer remnants retrieved from 2 patients approximately 2-3 months after implantation were analyzed and found to consist mostly of water and monomeric components with minimal detectable amounts of carmustine.",

Only BCNU, not its decomposition products, was detected by the polarographic assay. Levels of BCNU in liver of tumor-bearing animals were significantly lower (about 10 times) than those on healthy rats. A bi-exponential fit was used to calculate the kinetics of BCNU in plasma, kidney, lung and brain, but no difference could be found between healthy and Walker tumor-bearing rats. BCNU disappeared faster from adipose tissue of tumor-bearing animals than from normals.",

The previously identified product, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)urea (BCU), has been shown to be the major metabolite. Stable isotope labeling and mass spectral analysis of isolated metabolites indicate that BCU is formed exclusively from the metabolic denitrosation of BCNU. The rate of BCNU chemical decomposition in rat liver microsomal preparations deficient in NADPH and the metabolic disappearance rate in preparations containing added NADPH were measured and compared with the measured rate of metabolic formation of BCU under the same conditions. The rate of NADPH-dependent BCNU metabolism and BCU formation are equal within experimental error. BCNU was found to inhibit the rat liver 9000 g supernatant metabolism of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU).",

Temozolomide and carmustine have an earlier effect on nuclear organization and chromatin structure. In particular, temozolomideZ and carmustine induce clustering of pericentromeric heterochromatin regions and increase the amount of heterochromatic proteins MeCP2 and HP1alpha bound to chromatin. These drugs also decrease global levels of histone H3 acetylation and increase levels of histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3-triMeK9). These events precede the senescence status. ... Temozolomide and carmustine efficacy in glioma treatment may implicate a first event characterized by changes in heterochromatin organization and its silencing which is then followed by apoptosis and senescence.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material. Sender should use fastest & most secure form of transport & notify recipient of its departure.

Because carmustine is typically given in combination with other agents, its role in causing these serum enzyme elevations is not always clear. The abnormalities are generally transient, do not cause symptoms and do not require dose modification. Clinically apparent liver injury from carmustine has been limited to a small number of cases of cholestatic hepatitis and more frequent instances of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, reported mostly with its use in high doses or as a conditioning agent in preparation for hematopoietic cell transplantation. The onset of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is usually within two to three weeks of the myeloablation and is characterized by a sudden onset of abdominal pain, weight gain, ascites, marked increase in serum aminotransferase levels (and LDH), and subsequent jaundice and hepatic dysfunction. The severity of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome varies from a transient, self-limited injury to acute liver failure. The diagnosis of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is usually based on clinical features of tenderness and enlargement of the liver, weight gain, ascites and jaundice occurring within 3 weeks of chemotherapy. Liver biopsy is diagnostic but often contraindicated, because of severe thrombocytopenia after hematopoietic cell transplantation.",

Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.9X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates carmustine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase carmustine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.4 days. Particulate-phase carmustine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Carmustine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, carmustine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 150. However, by analogy to N-nitroso-N-ethylurea which exhibited a hydrolysis half-life of 47 minutes at pH 9, adsorption may be precluded by hydrolysis. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.8X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, carmustine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Carmustine is an alkylating agent that may hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to carmustine may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where carmustine is produced or used. The general population may only be exposed to carmustine via use as a drug, an antineoplastic. (SRC)",

However, by analogy to N-nitroso-N-ethylurea which exhibited a hydrolysis half-life of 47 minutes at pH 9(3), adsorption may be precluded by hydrolysis(SRC). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.8X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 5(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.53(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Carmustine is an alkylating agent that may hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2009).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

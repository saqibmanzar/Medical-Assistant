PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Absorbed fluoride is distributed throughout the tissues of the body by the blood. Fluoride concentrations in soft tissues fall to pre-exposure levels within a few hours of exposure. Fluoride exchange with hydroxyl radicals of hydroxyapatite (the inorganic constituent of bone) to form fluorohydroxyapatite. Fluoride that is not retained is excreted rapidly in urine. In adults under steady state intake conditions, the urinary concentration of fluoride tends to approximate the concentration of fluoride in the drinking water. This reflects the decreasing retention of fluoride (primarily in bone) with increasing age. Under certain conditions perspiration may be an important route of fluoride excretion. The concentration of fluoride retained in bones and teeth is a function of both the concentration of fluoride intake and the duration of exposure. Periods of excessive fluoride exposure will result in increased retention in the bone. However, when the excessive exposure is eliminated, the bone fluoride concentration will decrease to a concentration that is again reflective of intake. /Fluoride/",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

This effect was consistent in permeabilized cells with endogenous phospholipid PLD substrates. Inhibition was not caused by either fluoride or aluminum alone and was reversed by aluminum chelation. Inhibition of PLD by aluminum fluoride was not mediated by cAMP, phosphatases 1, 2A or 2B, or phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. AlF4- had a similar inhibitory effect on rArf-stimulated PLD, but did not block the translocation of Arf from cytosol to membranes, indicating a post-GTP-binding-protein site of action. Oleate-sensitive PLD, which is not guanine nucleotide-dependent, was also inhibited by AlF4-, supporting a G protein-independent mechanism of action. A submandibular Golgi-enriched membrane preparation had high PLD activity which was also potently inhibited by AlF4-, leading to speculation that the known fluoride inhibition of Golgi vesicle transport may be PLD-mediated.",

The first stage of this condition consists simply of an increase in bone density, particularly marked in the vertebral bodies and pelvis.

In the event of extreme and protracted exposure to fluoride, calcification of the paraspinal and other ligamentous structures as well as about joints are noted. /Aluminum fluorides/",

Such production has been connected with reversible bronchial obstruction or asthma. In an aluminum plant in Sweden, 6 cases of asthma occurred in 1975, and 7 in 1976. The number of exposed workers was 35-40. The levels of aluminum fluoride (personal sampling) were measured during these two years, and the mean concentrations were 3-6 mg/cu m. In 1977, improvements were made at this plant thereby reducing the mean levels of aluminum fluoride to 0.4-1.0 mg/cu m.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If tachycardia is excessive, it may be necessary to use a beta-blocking agent concomitantly.

It increases blood flow to the skin, mucosa and abdominal viscera, and lowers both supine and erect blood pressures. It has no effect on the parasympathetic system. Phenoxybenzamine works by blocking alpha receptors in certain parts of the body. Alpha receptors are present in the muscle that lines the walls of blood vessels. When the receptors are blocked by Phenoxybenzamine, the muscle relaxes and the blood vessels widen. This widening of the blood vessels results in a lowering of blood pressure.",

Endotracheal intubation with assisted ventilation may be required. Gut Decontamination. Emesis induction is indicated unless the patient is comatose, is convulsing, or has no gag reflex. If these are present, endotracheal intubation must be performed with a cuffed endotracheal tube before a large-bore gastric tube is inserted for gastric lavage. ... Activated Charcoal. Adults, 50-100 g; children, 15-30 g in aqueous or sorbital slurry, after emesis is induced or into the gastric tube after lavage. Cathartic. Magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate; adult, 30 g children, 250 mg/kg. No studies on efficacy are available with this group of drugs. Elimination enhancement. In view of the extensive protein binding and extensive volume of distribution of some drugs of this group, it is unlikely that hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis would be effective. In any case, no studies exist to demonstrate such efficacy. Most cases are amenable to good supportive therapy. Antidotes. There are no antidotes. /alpha-Adrenergic blockers/",

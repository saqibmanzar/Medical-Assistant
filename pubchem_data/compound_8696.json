When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Cobalt 2-ethyl hexanoate was assayed for the ability to induce mutation at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus (6-thioguanine [6TG] resistance) in mouse lymphoma cells. The results of this study were negative.",

It produces oxygen radicals and may be oxidized to ionic cobalt, causing increased lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and inducing certain enzymes that lead to cell apoptosis. Cobalt has also been shown to block inorganic calcium channels, possibly impairing neurotransmission. Cobalt can also chelate lipoic acids, impairing oxidation of pyruvate or fatty acids. In addition, cobalt may inhibit DNA repair by interacting with zinc finger DNA repair proteins, and has also been shown to inhibit heme synthesis and glucose metabolism. Cobalt may activate specific helper T-lymphocyte cells and interact directly with immunologic proteins, such as antibodies (IgA and IgE) or Fc receptors, resulting in immunosensitization. (L29)",

Patch testing revealed strong reactions to both cobalt chloride and a polyester resin that the patient had been using at her workplace. She also reacted to latex and had been wearing cotton gloves underneath rubber gloves at work. It was later discovered that cobalt octoate (synonym: cobalt-2-ethylhexanoate), a compound not listed on the manufacturer's material safety data sheet, was included as an accelerator in the polyester resin. She was then tested to cobalt octoate, which was also strongly positive. Her successful treatment included protection of her hands at work with cotton lined PVC gloves. This case highlights the role of cobalt salts as sensitizers and their presence as accelerators used in polyester resins, and the importance of recognizing concomitant latex allergy that may complicate occupational dermatitis. ...",

A 52 year old man who worked as an offset printer for 35 years presented with hand eczema of a long duration. Patch testing performed 12 years ago elicited a positive reaction to bacitracin and negative reactions to the standard series, rubber chemical series, and plastics and glues series. Recently, his hand eczema worsened, and therefore, further patch testing was performed. Cobalt-chloride elicited an allergic reaction in the standard series. Two ink driers from work containing 5% and 2% cobalt-2-ethylhexoate, respectively, elicited allergic reactions in a dilution series. The author stressed the importance of patch testing dermatitis patients in contact with inks or paints and to regard with care the potential relevance of cobalt allergic reactions in these patients.",

The study consisted of a cytotoxicity Range-Finder Experiment followed by two independent experiments, each conducted in the absence and presence of metabolic activation (S9). A 3-hour treatment incubation period was used for all experiments. In the cytotoxicity Range-Finder Experiment, six concentrations were tested in the absence and presence of S9, ranging from 6.25 to 2000 ug/mL (limited by solubility in culture medium). The highest concentration to provide >10% RTG was 125 ug/mL, which gave 10% and 18% RS in the absence and presence of S9, respectively. Accordingly, for Experiment I ten concentrations, ranging from 15 to 200 ug/mL, were tested in the absence and presence of S9. Seven days after treatment, the highest concentration selected to determine viability and 6TG resistance was 95 ug/mL in the absence and presence of S9, which gave 11% and 13% RS, respectively. In Experiment II ten concentrations, ranging from 10 to 150 ug/mL ug/mL, were tested in the absence and presence of S9. Seven days after treatment, the highest concentrations selected to determine viability and 6TG resistance were 100 ug/mL in the absence of S9 and 120 ug/mL in the presence of S9, which gave 14% and 13% RS, respectively. Negative (vehicle) and positive control treatments were included in each Mutation Experiment in the absence and presence of S9. Mutant frequencies in negative control cultures fell within acceptable ranges and clear increases in mutation were induced by the positive control chemicals. In Experiments I and II, no statistically significant increases in mutant frequency were observed following treatment with Cobalt 2-ethyl hexanoate at any concentration analyzed in the absence and presence of S9 and there were no significant linear trends.",

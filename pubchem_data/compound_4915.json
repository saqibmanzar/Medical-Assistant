PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Alkylating agents are so named because of their ability to add alkyl groups to many electronegative groups under conditions present in cells. They stop tumor growth by cross-linking guanine bases in DNA double-helix strands - directly attacking DNA. This makes the strands unable to uncoil and separate. As this is necessary in DNA replication, the cells can no longer divide. In addition, these drugs add methyl or other alkyl groups onto molecules where they do not belong which in turn inhibits their correct utilization by base pairing and causes a miscoding of DNA. Procarbazine is cell-phase specific for the S phase of cell division.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The characteristics of the reactions leading to the covalent binding of the N-methyl group of the azo derivative to microsomal protein and its metabolism to form methane, possessed a number of similarities in the apparent kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax), induction and inhibition patterns indicating a common pathway of metabolism to form a reactive intermediate and the involvement of cytochrome p450.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Adduct accumulation was observed in all seven cases, reaching levels up to 0.28 fmol/microgram of DNA (0.45 umol/mol of guanine). In one individual, maximal levels of adduct were reached after 7 days of exposure, followed by a steady decline, whereas in all other individuals continuous accumulation was observed throughout the exposure period. In four individuals for which data were available for day 11 (12 to 16 hr after the final intake of procarbazine), decreased amounts of O-6-methylguanine were observed relative to the last previous measurements. The accumulation of O-6-methylguanine was linearly correlated with the cumulative dose of procarbazine, with a slope of 0.011 fmol of O-6-methylguanine/microgram of DNA per mg/kg of body weight or 2.68x10-4 fmol of O-6-methylguanine DNA per mg/sq m. Two hr after the administration of single p.o. doses of l to 10 mg/kg of procarbazine to rats, O-6-methylguanine formation in leukocyte DNA was just under half that in liver DNA and showed a linear relationship with dose with a slope of 0.017 fmol/microgram of DNA per mg/kg of body weight or 5.67x10-4 fmol of O-6-methylguanine/microgram of DNA per mg/sq m. A negative correlation between the rate of accumulation of O-6-methylguanine in different individuals and lymphocyte O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase was observed, demonstrating a probable protective effect of O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase against the accumulation of O-6-methylguanine during exposure to methylating agents. This observation supports the suggestion of a possible role of procarbazine-induced O-6-methylguanine in the pathogenesis of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia appearing after treatment with chemotherapeutic protocols which include procarbazine, based on the finding of low lymphocyte O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase levels in patients with such therapy-related neoplastic disease. Lymphocyte O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase levels were mainly in the range of 5 to 10 fmol/micrograms of DNA and showed no consistent variation during procarbazine exposure.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

Immediate hospitalization and close monitoring of patient are essential during this period. Treatment may include the following: ... instillation of charcoal slurry in early overdose. Treatment of signs and symptoms of CNS stimulation with diazepam, administered intravenously and slowly. Treatment of hypotension and vascular collapse with intravenous fluids and a dilute pressor agent. Support of respiration by management of the airway, and mechanical ventilation with the use of supplemental oxygen, as required. Close monitoring of body temperature and vigorous treatment of hyperpyrexia with antipyretics and as cooling blanket. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance is essential. Reduction of symptoms of hypermetabolic state (coma, respiratory failure, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, muscular rigidity, tremor, and hyperreflexia) with intravenous dantrolene sodium at 2.5 mg/kg of body weight a day in divided doses, with careful monitoring for signs of hepatotoxicity and pleural or pericardial effusions. Hemodialysis may be beneficial but is of unproven value. Pathophysiologic effects of massive overdose may persist for several days; recovery from mild overdose may take 3 to 4 days.",

Bone marrow depression should be treated with the assistance of an experienced hematologist or oncologist. 5. Extravasation. Immediately stop the infusion and withdraw as much fluid as possible by negative pressure on the syringe. Then give the following specific treatment. a. Dactinomycin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, mitomycin-C, mitoxantrone, and plicamycin. Apply ice compresses to the extravasation site for 15 minutes 4 times daily for 4 days. Topical application of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may be beneficial (commercially available 50% solution is less concentrated than those used in experimental studies, but may be tried). There is no justification for injection of hydrocortisone or sodium bicarbonate. b. Mechlorethamine (and concentrated dacarbazine and cisplatin). Infiltrate the site of extravasation with 10 mL of sterile 2.5% sodium thiosulfate (dilute 1 mL of 25% thiosulfate with sterile water to a volume of 10 mL); apply ice compresses for 6-12 hours. c. Etoposide, paclitaxel, vincristine, or vinblastine. Place a heating pad over the area and apply heat intermittently for 24 hours; elevate the limb.

Our aim was to quantify the risk of STS as a second malignant neoplasm and to investigate its relationship with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. A cohort study of 4,400 3-year survivors of a first solid cancer diagnosed during childhood in France or the United Kingdom, between 1942 and 1985, was followed 15 years on average. In a partially nested case-control study, 25 cases of STS and 121 controls for sex, type of first cancer, age at first cancer and duration of follow-up /were matched/. Sixteen STS occurred in the cohort, as compared to 0.3 expected from the general population (Standardized Incidence Radio, SIR = 54 (95% CI: 34-89)). The SIR was 113 (95% CI: 62-185) after chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (13 STS), whereas it was 28 (95% CI: 2-125) after chemotherapy alone (1 STS) and 19 (95% CI: 3-60) after radiotherapy alone (2 STS). After adjustment for treatment, there was no evidence of variation in the annual excess of incidence or in the SIR with either age at first cancer or time since 1st cancer. In the case-control study, the risk of a STS was increased with the square of the dose of radiation to the site of STS development and with the administration of procarbazine. The increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma that occurred after childhood cancer is independently related to exposure to radiotherapy and procarbazine. A closer surveillance of children treated with this treatment combination is strongly recommended.",

In the rat, O-6-methylguanine in the liver DNA, and to a lesser degree in the spleen was efficiently removed throughout the 20 week dosing period, as indicated by the O-6-methylguanine/7-methylguanine ratio being much less than 0.11. In the target organs, accumulation of O-6-methylguanine began in the mammary gland after 9 weeks, and in the lymph node and thymus after 3 weeks of dosing. The accumulation of O-6-methylguanine in the mammary gland correlates well with a concomitant decrease in O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyl transferase levels as from week 10 and may be related to the induction of mammary gland tumors, first detected in two animals at week 10. In pigs, after a total dose of 750-4000 mg of procarbazine, the range of 7-methylguanine detected in leukocyte DNA was 21-66 umol/mol G, which compares well with findings in cancer patients treated with procarbazine. Similar levels of 7-methylguanine were detected in the pig liver, thymus and lymph node. O-6-Methylguanine was only detectable in leukocyte DNA at week 4. Compared with control pig tissues, a depressed O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyl transferase level was found in the leukocyte, lymph node and brain of the treated animals.",

Groups of 34 or 35 males and 35 or 36 females of both species were administered procarbazine at one of two doses, either 15 or 30 mg/kg for rats, and either 6 or 12 mg/kg for mice. Injections were made 3 times/wk for 26 wk for rats and 52 wk for the mice. Following the periods of injection, the dosed animals were observed for a maximum period of 60 wk for rats and 33 wk for mice depending upon survival. Vehicle controls, used for statistical evaluation, consisted of 10 rats and 15 mice of each sex administered saline soln on the same schedule as the test soln; the same numbers of rats and mice served as untreated controls. Pooled controls consisted of the vehicle controls from this bioassay together with the vehicle controls from two other bioassays similarly performed at the same laboratory. The pooled control groups consisted of 40 rats of each sex and 45 mice of each sex. Surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at 86 wk and surviving mice were /sacrificed/ at 85 wk. ... In rats, malignant lymphomas, adenocarcinomas of the mammary gland, and the combination of olfactory neuroblastomas, adenocarcinomas, or carcinomas of the brain, olfactory bulb, or cerebrum were induced in statistically significant numbers. In mice, malignant lymphomas or leukemias, olfactory neuroblastomas or undifferentiated carcinomas, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, and adenocarcinomas of the uterus were induced in statistically significant numbers. It is concluded under the conditions of this bioassay, procarbazine was carcinogenic in both Sprague-Dawley rats and B6C3F1 mice producing several types of tumors in both of these two species.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It inhibits both phosphodiesterase and adenosine uptake. Phosphodiesterase has shown to associated with age-related memory impairment and Alzheimer's disease. \u03b2-Amyloid protein 1\u201342 (\u03b242) can induce apoptosis in the cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting that it plays an important role in causing neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Propentofylline is also capable of activating a cAMP\u2013PKA system, depressing the caspase cascade and modifying Bcl-2 family proteins. Propentofylline blocked both the apoptotic features induced by \u03b242 and further induced an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. It suggests that the protection of propentofylline on the \u03b242-induced neurotoxicity is caused by enhancing anti-apoptotic action through cAMP\u2013PKA system.",

This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

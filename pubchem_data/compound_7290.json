The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Two long-term carcinogenicity studies with 3-MCPD in rats were identified as pivotal studies, and renal tubular hyperplasia was identified as the most sensitive end-point. The lowest BMDL10 for renal tubular hyperplasia was calculated to be 0.87 mg/kg bw per day for male rats. After application of a 200-fold uncertainty factor, the Committee established a group PMTDI of 4 \u00b5g/kg bw for 3-MCPD and 3-MCPD esters singly or in combination (expressed as 3-MCPD equivalents). The overall uncertainty factor of 200 incorporates a factor of 2 related to the inadequacies in the studies of reproductive toxicity. The previous PMTDI of 2 \u00b5g/kg bw for 3-MCPD, was withdrawn. The Committee noted that estimated dietary exposures to 3-MCPD for the general population, even for high consumers (up to 3.8 \u00b5g/kg bw per day), did not exceed the new PMTDI. Estimates of mean dietary exposure to 3-MCPD for formula-fed infants, however, could exceed the PMTDI by up to 2.5-fold for certain countries (e.g. 10 \u00b5g/kg bw per day in the first month of life).",

The reproductive toxicity of glycidol was believed to result from its conversion to alpha-chlorohydrin by the action of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The comparative disposition of glycidol was investigated in rats following oral or iv admin at doses of 37.5 and 75 mg/kg. ... Approx 87-92% of the dose was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of the rat. (14)C-Glycidol equivalents were eliminated in urine (40-48% of the dose in 72 hr), feces (5-12%), and exhaled as CO2 (26-32%). At both doses, 9-12% and 7-8% (estimated) of the dose remained in tissues at 24 or 72 hr following dosing, respectively. In general, the concn of glycidol equivalents in tissues were proportional to the dose. The highest concn of radioactivity were /noted/ in the blood cells, thyroid, liver, kidney, spleen, and the lowest in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and plasma. The pattern of distribution of radioactivity in tissues was similar for both the iv and oral routes. The total recovery of radioactivity ranged from 87 to 91% of the dose. Urinary radioactivity was resolved by HPLC analysis into 15 metabolites. There were one major (14-21% of the dose) and four lesser metabolites (each representing 2-8%); the others were minor, each representing 1% or less of the dose. In general, the urinary metabolic profile was similar to iv or oral admin of the two doses studied. ...",

This alteration disappeared gradually as the time went by. The recovery process also began at initial segment but its cycle was shortened gradually from initial segment to caudal segment. These results showed the factor that caused the above mentioned processes stemmed from the testis chiefly and was in epididymal plasma. It affected each epididymal segment along the epididymal lumen and to the injury of the epididymal epithelium; at the same time, the concentration of the factor became more decreased. The relationship between the antifertility effect of alpha-chlorohydrin and the ... ultrastructural changes of the epididymis and the mechanism of the double effects depending on dose of alpha-chlorohydrin were discussed.",

Male wistar rats were injected with 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (DC2P) and sacrificed at various intervals after the injections. DC2P injected rats showed zonal necrosis of the centrilobular space with a peak from 24 to 48 hr after the injection. Destruction of sinusoidal linings appeared at 4 hr, and was gradually aggravated along the advancing hepatocytic necrosis. Monocytic influx into the necrotic areas was initiated at 6 hr. At 48 hr, collapsed centrilobular spaces showed a loss of most sinusoidal structures with active phagocytosis of macrophages, proliferation of perisinusoidal cells and accumulation of collagen fibrils. At 72 hr, there were many regenerating sinusoidal structures, which were composed of rather thick and less fenestrated endothelium and underlying multilayered processes of mesenchymal cells, along the regenerating hepatocytes. In these areas, occasional junctions between regenerating hepatocytes and mesenchymal cells were /observed/. Reconstruction of sinusoidal linings was closely related to the hepatocytic regeneration, and a hepatocytic mesenchymal interaction might participate in this morphodynamic course of the sinusoidal reconstruction.",

However, if the victim is conscious and not convulsing and if medical help is not readily available, consider the risk of inducing vomiting because of the high toxicity of the chemical ingested. Ipecac syrup or salt water may be used in such an emergency. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to the atmosphere, 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.2 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2 days. An estimated Koc value of 1 suggests that 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane will have very high mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Data regarding the aerobic biodegradation of 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane in soil and water are variable; in screening tests, this compound reached 0 to 1% of the theoretical BOD in 5 days and 68% of the theoretical BOD in 14 days. Under anaerobic conditions, 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane may be resistant to biodegradation. In water, 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane is not expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its Koc value. This compound is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may be low based on an estimated BCF value of 0.2. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at workplaces where 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane is produced or used. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF value of 0.2(1,SRC), from an estimated log Kow(9,SRC), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Data regarding the aerobic biodegradation of 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane in water are inconclusive; in screening tests, this compound reached 0(5) to 1%(6) of the theoretical BOD in 5 days and 68% of the theoretical BOD in 14 days(7). Under anaerobic conditions, 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane may be resistant to biodegradation; using an acclimated culture, only 26% of the initial 3-chloro-1,2-dihydroxypropane concentration was utilized in 90 days(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

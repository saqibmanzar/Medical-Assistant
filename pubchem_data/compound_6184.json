Uremic toxins can be subdivided into three major groups based upon their chemical and physical characteristics: 1) small, water-soluble, non-protein-bound compounds, such as urea; 2) small, lipid-soluble and/or protein-bound compounds, such as the phenols and 3) larger so-called middle-molecules, such as beta2-microglobulin. Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.\nHexanal is an alkyl aldehyde found in human biofluids. Human milk samples collected from women contains hexanal. Among mediators of oxidative stress, highly reactive secondary aldehydic lipid peroxidation products can initiate the processes of spontaneous mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and can also act as a growth-regulating factors and signaling molecules. In specimens obtained from adult patients with brain astrocytomas, lower levels of n-hexanal are associated with poorer patient prognosis. Hexanal is a volatile compound that has been associated with the development of undesirable flavours. The content of hexanal, which is a major breakdown product of linoleic acid (LA, n - 6 PUFA) oxidation, has been used to follow the course of lipid oxidation and off-flavour development in foods, and have been proposed as one potential marker of milk quality. A cardboard-like off-flavour is frequently associated with dehydrated milk products. This effect is highly correlated with the headspace concentration of hexanal. (A7871, A7872).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

All the activity found in the crude homogenate could be accounted for by the sum of the cytosolic and microsomal activities. Highest activities were found with the medium chain length substrates hexanal and nonanal in all fractions. Apparent affinity for hexanal and nonanal in the cytosolic fraction were comparable to that found in rats, but the theoretical maximal velocity for these substrates, and the specific activities for the other substrates, were much lower than found in mammals. In another study with carcinogen fed fish, aldehyde dehydrogenase distribution was evaluated histochemically in cryostat sections. In control trout, aldehyde dehydrogenase was uniformly distributed without an apparent zonal pattern. However, in hepatic tumors, aldehyde dehydrogenase was apparently induced with hexanal, nonanal, and propionaldehyde giving the strongest reaction products.",

This enzyme, T-ALDH, is identical to the aldehyde dehydrogenase inducible in rat liver by 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin and the tumor associated aldehyde dehydrogenase found in rat hepatocellular neoplasms. With either NAD or NADP as coenzyme, the preferred substrates were the aliphatic aldehydes n-hexanal, n-nonanal, and isobutyraldehyde and the aromatic aldehydes 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde. T-ALDH may play a role in oxidizing a variety of aldehydes produced in physiological lipid metabolism. On the contrary, this isozyme does not seem to participate in the oxidation of small aliphatic aldehydes generated during lipid peroxidation.",

Class III shows poor activity with these aldehydes.

We have previously demonstrated in vitro that pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) catalyzes the condensation of saturated aldehydes with pyruvate to form acyloins. We have further shown in perfused rat heart that hexanal, presumably via PDH, is converted to 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one and that it in turn can be reduced to 2,3-octanediol. We now extend this work using intra-striatal microdialysis to show that this reaction also occurs in rat brain. The reduction of hexanal to hexanol was also evaluated. Microdialysis probes were implanted bilaterally in the striatum and were infused with hexanal with and in the absence of added pyruvate. Analysis of microdialysis samples showed a release of 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one (9.5-10.5 pmol/min), 2,3-octanediol (2.2-2.7 pmol/min) and hexanol (64-74 pmol/min). Pyruvate addition did not increase 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one or 2,3-octanediol production. In a second series of experiments where no exogenous hexanal was infused, endogenous production of 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one (1.0-1.3 pmol/min) and 2,3-octanediol (1.0-1.2 pmol/min) was still observed, although no hexanol was detected. We also investigated the possibility that oxidative stress induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) would increase lipid peroxidation resulting in increased production of 3-hydroxyoctan-2-one. Analysis of samples collected following MPP+ infusion indicated no additional increase suggesting that brief exposure to MPP+ does not increase hexanal formation over baseline levels during the experimental period.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In atherosclerosis inhibition of cell-cell communication by atherogenic compounds, e.g., low density lipoproteins (LDL), also seems to be important. For testing atherogenic compounds we used an atherosclerosis relevant cell type, namely human smooth muscle cells. In order to investigate which part of the LDL particle would be involved in inhibition of metabolic co-operation between human smooth muscle cells in culture ... several fatty acids and their breakdown products /were tested/, namely aldehydes. Unsaturated C-18 fatty acids markedly influenced gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), whereas saturated (C18:0, C16:0) and unsaturated fatty acids with > 20 carbon atoms did not inhibit GJIC. In the case of oleic and elaidic acid, orientation seemed important; however, after exposure to palmitoleic and palmitelaidic acid no differences were found. The most potent inhibitor of GJIC was linoleic acid, which inhibited GJIC by 75%. No correlation was found between degrees of unsaturation and ability to inhibit GJIC. Of the tested aldehydes, hexanal, propanal, butanal and 4-hydroxynonenal did significantly inhibit GJIC, while pentanal had no effect. Since modification of LDL was shown to be important in order for LDL to inhibit GJIC, these results show that fatty acids and their oxidative breakdown products may be of importance for the inhibition of GJIC by LDL.",

Poly(methacrylic acid-ethlyene glycol dimethacrylate) (MAA-EGDMA) monolith was in situ synthesized in the micro-channel of frit by photopolymerization. A monolith frit-based solid-phase microextraction method (SPME) was developed for the determination of hexanal and heptanal in serum samples by combining with high-performance liquid chromatography. 2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) as the derivatizing reagent was absorbed on a monolith frit, then its derivatization reaction with aldehydes and the absorption of formed hydrazones on the monolith disk occurred simultaneously. The condition parameters for polymerization, derivatization and extraction were optimized systematically. Under the optimum conditions, rigid structure, low back-pressure and high column capacity were achieved for the monolith frit. The limits of detection for hexanal and heptanal were 1.86 and 1.38 nmol/L, respectively. The inter- and intra-day relative standard deviations were less than 7.7% (n = 6). This method was applied successfully to aldehydes analysis in human serum samples. The method possesses advantages such as simplicity, efficiency, low cost and good biocompatibility. It provides an alternative approach for quantification of aldehydes in complex biological samples.",

And then simultaneous extraction and derivatization of the aldehydes were performed on the DNPH-adsorbed Fe3O4/SiO2/P(MAA-co-EGDMA). The simple, rapid and sensitive determination of hexanal and heptanal can be accomplished within 9min. Under optimized conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) were 1.7 and 2.5nmol/L for hexanal and heptanal, respectively. The relative recoveries ranged from 72.8% to 91.4% with the intra- and inter-day relative standard deviations (RSDs) being less than 9.6%. Furthermore, the proposed method was successfully applied to determine endogenous hexanal and heptanal in human urine from healthy persons and lung cancer patients. The results showed the higher concentrations of hexanal and heptanal were observed in lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Thus, the developed MSPE-ISD method is suitable for the determination of aldehydes in urines.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Aldehydes can react with air to give first peroxo acids, and ultimately carboxylic acids. These autoxidation reactions are activated by light, catalyzed by salts of transition metals, and are autocatalytic (catalyzed by the products of the reaction). The addition of stabilizers (antioxidants) to shipments of aldehydes retards autoxidation. May attack some forms of plastics (USCG, 1999).",

It is not registered for current use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. Hexanal is used in fruit flavors and, when highly diluted, in perfumery for obtaining fruity notes. It is also used in organic synthesis of plasticizers, rubber chemicals, dyes, synthetic resins, insecticides. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Twelve healthy volunteers were exposed to 0, 2, and 10 ppm n-hexanal for 2 hours at rest in a balanced order. Ratings of discomfort in the eyes and nose, solvent smell, and headache increased significantly with the level of exposure. Frequency of blinking was significantly increased at 10 ppm. No effects on pulmonary function and nasal swelling were detected, except a not-significant tendency to increased nasal obstruction at 10 ppm. No clear effects on plasma inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) were observed. /It was concluded that/ two hours of exposure to n-hexanal results in mild irritation at 10 ppm, with no apparent adversity at 2 ppm. n-Hexanal at 0.1% depressed motility of human spermatozoa but never rendered the sperm completely immotile. The increased concentrations of lower molecular weight aldehydes, including hexanal, may interfere with cholesterol transport and gap junctional intercellular communication. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acute exposures to the concentrated vapor for 1 hour or to 2000 ppm for 4 hours result in mortality to rats and is cytotoxic to rat hepatocytes. Rats receiving diets containing hexyl aldehyde for 3 wk showed decrease in serum cholesterol and triglyceride. Hexanal stimulates dopamine release but does not inhibit dopamine uptake in the brain striatum of rats. Hexanal influenced the length of time virgin female mice engage in the maternal crouching behavior. Hexanal was mutagenic in mammalian cells. Hexanal produced DNA single-strand breaks, or lesions which were converted to breaks in alkali.",

Increased levels of uremic toxins can stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. This seems to be mediated by the direct binding or inhibition by uremic toxins of the enzyme NADPH oxidase (especially NOX4 which is abundant in the kidneys and heart) (A7868). Reactive oxygen species can induce several different DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are involved in the silencing of a protein known as KLOTHO.  KLOTHO has been identified as having important roles in anti-aging, mineral metabolism, and vitamin D metabolism. A number of studies have indicated that KLOTHO mRNA and protein levels are reduced during acute or chronic kidney diseases in response to high local levels of reactive oxygen species (A7869). ",

By this method, the cytotoxicities of a linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LOOH) and its related aliphatic aldehydes toward human umbilical vein endothelial cells were investigated. Saturated aldehydes pentanal, hexanal and 9-oxononanoic acid, are nontoxic; alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes, 2-hexenal, 2-heptenal, 2-octenal, and 2-nonenal are toxic only at high concentrations; linoleic acid hydroperoxide and alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes with a hydroxy group or an additional double bond are highly toxic.",

The amounts of 4-HN increased in the liver and lung were ca. 0.085 and 0.43% to the dose administered, respectively, 5 min after the injection. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content and both GSH peroxidase (GSH-Px) and GSH reductase (GSSGR) activities in the lung were decreased significantly by 4-HN treatment. On the other hand, in the case of iv injection of n-hexanal into mice, the amount of n-hexanal detected in the lung was 5.0% to that of 4-HN, and no effect on the activities of GSH-Px and GSSGR and the content of GSH was observed...",

Its former use as an insecticide resulted in its direct release to the environment. Hexaldehyde occurs naturally in many fruits, vegetables, meats, and shellfish. Hexaldehyde is also in vapor given off northern red oak, dawn redwood, bass wood and tulip poplar trees, and many other plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 11.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates hexaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase hexaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hrs at 23 \u00b0C and 14 hrs at 25 \u00b0C. Hexaldehyde does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, hexaldehyde is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 50. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.13X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. According to one fungal growth experiment, hexaldehyde may not biodegrade in soil or water, but the straight chain aldehyde structure of hexaldehyde would suggest rapid biodegradation. However, utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 50% of its theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, hexaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to hexaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexaldehyde is produced or used.

Volatilization of hexaldehyde from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 2.13X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Hexaldehyde is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 11.3 mm Hg(5). According to a fungal growth experiment, hexaldehyde was oxidized but did not support growth(6) which suggests that it may not biodegrade in soil(SRC). However, the straight chain aldehyde structure of hexaldehyde would suggest rapid biodegradation(7). A 50% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(8) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.13X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hrs and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 7(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Hexaldehyde is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a fungal growth experiment, hexaldehyde was oxidized but did not support growth(6) which suggests that it may not biodegrade in water(SRC). However, the straight chain aldehyde structure of hexaldehyde would suggest rapid biodegradation(7). A 50% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(8) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase hexaldehyde is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 and 14 hrs(SRC), calculated from rate constants of 3.17X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 23 \u00b0C(3) and 2.79X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C, respectively(4). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of hexaldehyde with nitrate radical has been experimentally determined to be 1.64X10-14 cu cm/sec(4) and 1.28X10-14 cu cm/sec(5). These correspond to atmospheric half-lives of about 49 and 63 hrs, respectively, at a concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(6). Hexaldehyde does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is not susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Hexaldehyde was identified as an ozone disinfection by-product in drinking water samples from a pilot plant in Jefferson Parish, LA which uses Mississippi River as the raw water source; samples were collected following 4 rounds of ozonation treatment performed in January, 1994, August 1994, May 1995, and September 1996(2). Hexaldehyde was not detected when using ozone, ozone with bromide, chloramination, chloramination with bromide, chlorine dioxide, chlorine dioxide with bromide, chlorine, and chlorine with bromide treatments; it was suggested that the bromine consumes some of the disinfectants and results in a small reduction in oxidizing power(3).",

Hexaldehyde was identified, not quantified, in rush hour traffic air samples taken at the Oakland-San Francisco Bay Bridge toll plaza on April 23, 2001 between 5:00-7:00 pm, April 24, 2001 between 6:00-10:00 am, and 3:00-7:00 pm(2). Emissions of hexaldehyde (as percent of total non-methane organic compounds) were identified in regular whole gas (0.81%), high grade whole gas (0.65%), roadway (0.04%), bus parking garage hot soak (0.24%), bus parking garage cold start (0.26%), motorcycle emissions (0.02%), lead smelter (0.42%), and cast iron factory emissions (0.89%) in Cairo, Egypt(3). Hexaldehyde was found in the volatiles from a Los Angeles roadway tunnel at 5 ug/L(4). Hexaldehyde was found in highway tunnels in Tuscarora; light duty trucks emitted 0.014 mg/km traveled or 0.202 mg/L fuel used, heavy duty trucks emitted 0.542 mg/km traveled or 1.708 mg/L fuel used(5). Hexaldehyde was measured in the emissions of medium duty diesel trucks at a rate of 2200 ug/km in the gas phase(6). Hexaldehyde was measured in the emissions of gasoline powered motor vehicles at a rate of 300 ug/km and 19,000 ug/km for catalyst equipped engines and non-catalyst equipped engines(7). Hexaldehyde emissions from an automobile running on Swedish environmental classified diesel fuel were 6.8 mg/km and the same automobile running on European program emissions fuel were 3.7 mg/km(8). Hexaldehyde has been measured in the emissions of light-duty vehicles measured at the Caldecott tunnel in California; in 1999, 2001, and 2006 emission factors of 0.30, 0.39, and 0.23 mg/kg were reported(9).",

Hexaldehyde levels in a radiator plant, damp mineral wool insulation, and private homes were 37, 0.1, and 1 ug/cu m(2). The average concentration of hexaldehyde in indoor air in Northern Italy was 10 ug/cu m(3). Hexaldehyde was detected in the air of all 26 houses tested for the presence of organic compounds(4). In 50 normal houses (residents report no problems) the average concentration was 6.60 ug/cu m(4). Out of 38 sick houses (residents complained of problems) 5.3 % had concentrations of hexaldehyde 10-50 times higher than the median concentration of the normal houses (5.41 Ug cu m)(4). In a study of new and recently renovated buildings in Switzerland, the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the concentrations of hexaldehyde detected are <5, 34, and 1461 ug/cu m, respectively(5). Hexaldehyde was found at concentrations of 7.9-25.9 ppb in new manufactured and at 14.1-51.3 ppb in site-built houses(6). Hexaldehyde was found in 15 of 15 indoor residences at an average concentration of 4.0 ppb and 9 of 9 work places at an average concentration of 1.7 ppb in Helsinki samples tested May to Sep 1997(7). Hexaldehyde was detected but concentrations were not reported in the vehicles of 50 late shift patrol cars Aug 13 to Oct 11, 2001(8). Hexaldehyde was not detected in four newly carpeted rooms, after 27 hrs of exposure to 409 ppb ozone added to the rooms hexaldehyde concentrations were 0.78-4.6 ppb, ozone exposure was ceased and after 23-29 hrs hexaldehyde concentrations were not detected to 0.51 ppb(9). Hexaldehyde was detected in indoor and outdoor air from residential houses in New Jersey at mean concentrations of 1.28 and 0.60 ppb, respectively(10). In Melbourne, Australia hexaldehyde was detected 11 of 27 new and established buildings. Hexaldehyde was detected in non-complaint buildings at a geometric mean of 3.2 ug/cu m (61 air samples collected), detected in complaint buildings at a geometric mean of 6.1 ug/cu m (11 samples collected), and from all 27 associated outdoor sites at a geometric mean of 2.3 ug/cu m (37 air samples collected). Levels in a new dwelling following construction were reported as follows (ug/cu m): living room - 38, 62, 11, and 9.3 on days 2, 19, 72, and 246, respectively; bedroom - 33, 63, 14, 16 on days 2, 19, 72, and 246, respectively; outdoor - <0.5, 0.5, 0.9 on days 2, 19, and 246, respectively(11). Hexaldehyde was measured in residential indoor and outdoor air collected between 1990 to 2001 from 234 homes in the Los Angeles area. Median concentrations for indoor and outdoor samples were 3.81 and 2.01 ug/cu m(12). Hexaldehyde was detected in 37 small and medium sized buildings sampled in California. Indoor concentrations ranged from 0.53 to 27.5 ug/cu m with a mean of 3.45 ug/cu m(13).",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Subchronic inhalation toxicity studies have demonstrated that dibasic ester induce a mild degeneration of the olfactory, but not the respiratory, epithelium of the rat nasal cavity. Carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis of the individual dibasic esters is more efficient in olfactory than in respiratory mucosal homogenates. In the present study, an in vitro system of cultured rat nasal explants was utilized to determine if dibasic ester toxicity is dependent on a metabolic activation by nonspecific carboxylesterase. Explants from both the olfactory and the respiratory regions of the female rat nasal cavity were incubated for 2 hr in Williams' medium E containing 10-100 mM dimethyl adipate, dimethyl glutarate, or dimethyl succinate, dibasic ester caused a dose-related increase in nasal explant acid phosphatase release, a biochemical index of cytotoxicity. HPLC analysis demonstrated parallel increases in the carboxylesterase-mediated formation of monomethyl ester metabolites. Diacid metabolite production in the nasal explant system was not entirely concentration-dependent. Metabolite concentrations and acid phosphatase release were generally greater in olfactory than respiratory tissues. dibasic ester-induced cytotoxicity and acid metabolite production were markedly attenuated in nasal tissue excised from rats which were pretreated with bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, a carboxylesterase inhibitor. This study presents a viable in vitro method for assessing organic ester cytotoxicity in the rat nasal cavity. It was shown that dibasic ester are weak nasal toxicants under the conditions of this system. It was further demonstrated that dibasic ester toxicity is dependent on a carboxylesterase-mediated activation. A similar mechanism was proposed for the nasal toxicity induced by other organic esters following inhalation exposure.",

Female rats are more sensitive to these effects than are male rats. It has been proposed that carboxylesterase conversion of inhaled esters within nasal tissues to organic acids may be a critical biochemical step in converting these chemicals to toxic substances. These experiments measured the kinetic parameters Vmax, Km, Ksi, and V/K for the hydrolysis of the dibasic esters in the target nasal tissue, olfactory mucosa, and nontarget tissue, respiratory mucosa. It was determined that under the conditions of these experiments, diacid metabolites are not formed. Esterase activity was inhibited by pretreatment with bis p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Vmax values for the three dibasic esters were 5- to 13-fold greater in olfactory mucosa than respiratory mucosa for male or female rats. V/K values were 4- to 11-fold greater in olfactory mucosa than respiratory mucosa for male or female rats. V/K was similar between male and female olfactory mucosa when dimethyl glutarate was used as the substrate. With dimethyl succinate or dimethyl adipate as the substrate, V/K for female olfactory tissue was 0.5- or 2-fold that of males, respectively. Differences in V/K were mainly due to decreases in KM associated with increasing carbon chain length. Substrate inhibition was observed at dibasic ester concentrations greater than approximately 25 mM, which are unlikely to be achieved in vivo. These results lend further support to the hypothesis that organic acid accumulation in the target tissue, olfactory mucosa, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of dibasic ester-induced nasal lesions. The mechanism nay be applicable to a wide range of inhaled esters.",

Young male rats were exposed, nose-only, to an aerosol/vapor mixture of dibasic esters at a concentration of 5,900 mg/cu m for 4 hr and subsequently killed at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days after exposure. Nasal lesions were distributed along major inspiratory airflow routes. Widespread epithelial denudation occurred in the anterior nasal cavity, but the lesions were confined to the dorsal meatus, adjacent the nasal septum, and the lateral middle meatus in the mid-anterior nasal cavity. The lesions were markedly less severe in the posterior nasal cavity and sharply confined to the tips of dorsal ethmoturbinates and adjacent nasal septum. The damaged cuboidal/nonciliated and respiratory epithelium in the anterior nasal cavity regained a normal structure by 4 and 7 days postexposure, respectively. The regeneration of damaged olfactory epithelium was related to the severity of initial tissue damage. Slightly damaged epithelium regained a normal appearance within 1-2 weeks, but the extensively denuded epithelium of the dorsal meatus in the anterior nasal cavity failed to regain a normal structure by 6 weeks. The sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium appeared to be the initial site of DBE nasal injury. In the early stages of regeneration, the epithelium was repaired by proliferating stem cells derived from basal cells. Numerous mitotic figures and bromodeoxyuridine labeling were found in the regenerating basal cells, stem cells, and sustentacular cells at 4 and 7 days. As repair processes advanced, the numbers of olfactory neurons and vesicles were increased with a proportional decrease in stem cells.",

In short-term cultures of rat nasal explants, it has been demonstrated that dibasic esters cytotoxicity is due to a carboxylesterase-mediated activation. In the present study, the putative toxic metabolites of dibasic esters, the monomethyl esters and the dicarboxylic acids, were evaluated in the explant system at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mM. Mononethyl adipate, monomethyl glutarate, and monomethyl succinate induced increases in nasal explant acid phosphatase release, a biochemical index of cytotoxicity. The nasal explant-mediated metabolism of Mononethyl adipate and monomethyl glutarate to their corresponding diacids paralleled the increases in acid phosphatase release. A carboxylesterase inhibitor, bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate, inhibited both the cytotoxicity and the hydrolysis of and monomethyl glutarate in the nasal explant system. The metabolism and cytotoxicity of monomethyl succinate was not attenuated as effectively by bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate pretreatment. Adipate, glutarate, and succinate induced concentration-related increases in cytotoxicity in the nasal explant system. These dicarboxylic acids were neither metabolized nor utilized significantly by the nasal explants. Diacid-induced cytotoxicity was not attenuated by bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate pretreatment. This study further established the utility of the nasal explant system for evaluating cytotoxicity of organic esters in vitro. It was established that both the monomethyl ester and diacid metabolites are cytotoxic in rat nasal explants. Finally, it was concluded that although both the monomethyl esters and the diacids contribute to the cytotoxic potential of dibasic esters in vitro, it is critical to establish if one or both of these are formed in vivo in order to identify the ultimate toxic metabolite of dibasic esters.",

If released to the atmosphere, dimethyl succinate is expected to exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere based on an estimated vapor pressure of 0.46 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase dimethyl succinate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 14 days). If released to soil, an estimated Koc of 37 suggests that dimethyl succinate is expected to have very high mobility in soil. Dimethyl succinate is not expected to volatilize from dry or wet soil surfaces based on this compound's vapor pressure and an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C, respectively. If released into water, dimethyl succinate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based on an estimated Koc of 37. The potential for bioconcentration of dimethyl succinate in aquatic organisms is low based on an estimated BCF of 1.1. Volatilization of dimethyl succinate from water surfaces is not expected to be important based on this compound's Henry's Law constant. Dimethyl succinate has been estimated to be highly biodegraded, with ultimate biodegradation occurring over a period of weeks. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 85 days and 2.3 years at pHs 8 and 7, respectively, indicate that hydrolysis of dimethyl succinate is not expected to be environmentally significant. Occupational exposure to dimethyl succinate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyl succinate is produced or used. The general population will be exposed to dimethyl succinate via ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Dimethyl succinate is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF value of 1.1(3,SRC), from a measured log Kow(2), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Based upon a group contribution method for predicting the probability and rate of aerobic biodegradation(6), dimethyl succinate has been estimated to be highly biodegraded with complete biodegradation occurring over a period of weeks(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

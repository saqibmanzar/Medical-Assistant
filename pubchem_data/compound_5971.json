Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is a constituent of mustard, horseradish and wasabi and certain vegetables found in the human diet, mostly in cruciferous vegetables. AITC is a colorless to pale yellow liquid that is slightly soluble in water, but well soluble in most organic solvents. AITC possesses numerous biochemical and physiological activities. It is cytotoxic and tumorigenic at high doses and also is a modulator of enzymes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics, including carcinogens. It is plausible that the wide consumption of dietary AITC may have profound effects on human health. oxidative DNA damage may play important roles in carcinogenic processes induced by AITC. Allergic contact dermatitis from AICT is well known but infrequently reported. AITC is occasionally found as a volatile component of normal human biofluids. (A7698, A7770, A7771, A7772, A7773).",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Mice excreted in urine the same major metabolite identified in rat urine as well as three other major and two minor metabolites. Sex-related variations were observed in the relative amounts of these metabolites. Both species excreted a single metabolite in feces. Metabolism of AITC by male and female rats was similar, but female rats excreted over twice the urine volume of male rats. Results of the present study indicate that excretion of a more concentrated solution of AITC metabolite(s) in urine may account for the toxic effects of AITC on the bladder of male rats.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Mitotic arrest by AITC was associated with increased ubiquitination and degradation of alpha- and beta-tubulin. AITC directly binds to multiple cysteine residues of the tubulins. AITC induced mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis, as shown by cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytoplasm, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and formation of TUNEL-positive cells. Inhibition of caspase-9 blocked AITC-induced apoptosis. Moreover, /investigators/ found that apoptosis induction by AITC depended entirely on mitotic arrest and was mediated via Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser-70. Pre-arresting cells in G(1) phase by hydroxyurea abrogated both AITC-induced mitotic arrest and Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Overexpression of a Bcl-2 mutant prevented AITC from inducing apoptosis. /Investigators/ further showed that AITC-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation was caused by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and AITC activates JNK. Taken together, this study has revealed a novel anticancer mechanism of a phytochemical that is commonly present in human diet.",

Murine RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were supplemented with increasing concentrations of AITC. In addition, C57BL/6 mice (n= 10 per group) were fed a pro-inflammatory high-fat diet and AITC was administered orally via gavage for 7 days. Biomarkers of inflammation were determined both in cultured cells and in mice. AITC significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA levels and its secretion in LPS stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, gene expression of other pro-inflammatory markers including interleukin-1beta and inducible nitric oxide synthase were down-regulated following AITC treatment. AITC decreased nuclear p65 protein levels, a subunit of the transcription factor NF-?B. Importantly, /this/ data indicates that AITC significantly attenuated microRNA-155 levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory effects of AITC were accompanied by an increase in Nrf2 nuclear translocation and consequently by an increase of mRNA and protein levels of the Nrf2 target gene heme-oxygenase 1. AITC was slightly less potent than sulforaphane (used as a positive control) in down-regulating inflammation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. A significant increase in nuclear Nrf2 and heme-oxygenase 1 gene expression and only a moderate down-regulation of interleukin-1beta and microRNA-155 levels due to AITC was found in mouse liver. Present data suggest that AITC exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity in cultured macrophages in vitro but has only little anti-inflammatory activity in mice in vivo.",

In this study, AITC was shown to inhibit the proliferation of human metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma SW620 cells in vitro by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. The signaling pathway of AITC action involved the down-regulation of the pivotal Cdc25B and Cdc25C protein phosphatases in the treated cells. Quantitative real-time PCR of AITC-treated SW620 cells revealed a time-dependent down-regulation of Cdc25B and Cdc25C mRNA levels, which resulted in a decrease in the expression levels of these two proteins. Upon prolonged exposure, AITC induced caspase-mediated apoptosis in SW620 cells. The apoptotic process was evidenced by the activation of initiator caspases (-8 and -9) and effector caspases (-3 and -7), and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The antitumor activity of AITC was further demonstrated in a SW620 xenograft in vivo. ...",

In this study AITC, BITC and PEITC significantly increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, an upstream target of Nrf2 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. EKR1/2 phosphorylation was accompanied by an increased nuclear translocation and transactivation of Nrf2. AITC, BITC and PEITC significantly enhanced mRNA and protein levels of the Nrf2 targets gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (gammaGCS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). HO-1 and gammaGCS both contain CpG islands within their promoter region. However, analysis of DNA methylation status in NIH3T3 cells indicated that expression of these genes may not be dependant on promoter methylation. ...Aliphatic and aromatic isothiocyanates such as AITC, BITC and PEITC induce phase 2 and antioxidant enzymes in cultured fibroblasts.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Sixty subjects participated in the experiment, which employed psychophysical (intensity ratings) and psychophysiological (skin conductance response) measurements. Nasal stimuli were delivered three times with different inter-stimulus intervals. The results showed that the psychophysical and psycho-physiological data were correlated and that the successive nasal stimuli after a short period of time (<2 min) produced increased intensity of irritation, whereas the stimuli delivered after >3 min produced a markedly decreased intensity of irritation. ...",

Administration of AITC decreased significantly the number of total WBCs on days 1-4 post s.c. injection by 25-27%. Administration of AITC also decreased the number of lymphocytes on days 1-10 by 21-36% and monocyte on days 1-8 by 28-78%. However, administration of AITC increased the number of neutrophil on days 8-10 by 61-112%. AITC did not change the number of eosinophil and basophil. Plasma corticosterone concentrations during the experimental period were 4.7-8.4 times significantly higher in the AITC group than in the control group, indicating that AITC induced stress-responses. The relative weights of thymus and adrenals per body weight were significantly lower and clearly higher in the AITC group than in the control group, respectively. These results suggest that AITC-mediated stress-responses are at least in part attributable to changes in the number of circulating WBCs.",

Its use as an animal repellant and soil fumigant will result in its direct release to the environment. The compound is present in the leaves and seeds of plants such as mustards, horse raddish, and certain cabbages. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.70 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates allyl isothiocycanate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase allyl isothiocycanate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.4 hours. Allyl isothiocycanate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, allyl isothiocyanate is expected to have moderatet mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 260. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Allyl isothiocyanate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A mean half-life of 2 days in 6 different soils maintained at 75% moisture capacity and 20 \u00b0C was reported for allyl isothiocycanate. When maintained under aerobic conditions, transformation rates were not affected, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, allyl isothiocyanate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.5 hours and 5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 30 days if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 12 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since isocyanates hydrolyze readily under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to allyl isothiocycanate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where allyl isothiocycanate is produced or used. Use and monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to allyl isothiocycanate via ingestion of certain foods and dermal contact with consumer products containing allyl isothiocycanate.

Allyl isothiocyanate is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(2). A mean half-life of 2 days in 6 different soils  maintained at 75% moisture capacity and 20 \u00b0C was reported for allyl isothiocycanate. When maintained under aerobic conditions, transformation rates were not affected(5), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.70 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 2000 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.5 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 30 days if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 12(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.15(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A mean half-life of 2 days in 6 different soils maintained at 75% moisture capacity and 20 \u00b0C was reported for allyl isothiocycanate. When maintained under aerobic conditions, transformation rates were not affected(10), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that allyl isothiocyanate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3).

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column.  The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 30 days if adsorption is considered(4).

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Serious accidents have occurred during the commercial preparation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenol by alkaline partial hydrolysis of 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene during the period 1949 to 1976 ... The earlier process used methanolic alkali under autogenous pressure to effect the hydrolysis, and on 2 occasions around 1949 the reaction at 125 \u00b0C went out of control, one attaining 400 \u00b0C. ... In a further incidents in 1953, the explosion was associated with the post reaction stage during distillation of methanol from the reaction mixture. The later process used ethylene glycol as solvent to effect hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide and operated essentially at or near atmosphere pressure. ... Violent decomposition could ... occur during the subsequent solvent distillation phase in the absence of effective temp control. A laboratory residue from vacuum stripping using electric heating (without knowledge of the liquid temp) exploded when the vapor temp had reached 160 \u00b0C. In the Coalite plant incident in 1968, where the hydrolysis was run at about 180 \u00b0C in a reaction vessel heated by circulating oil at 300 \u00b0C, failure of the manually regulated oil heating system led to an uncontrollable temp incr during 50 min to above 250 \u00b0C, when a violent explosion occurred.",

TCB treatment at 0.18% was significantly more toxic than anticipated. Nineteen of the 20 high-dose females died (or were humanely sacrificed) & almost all of these deaths occurred at parturition. None of the males died. In the 0.072% group, a 9% (significant) decr in the number of live pups/litter was noted; no changes were observed in pup weights, proportion of male pups, or days to deliver each litter. Task 3, the determination of the affected sex, was not conducted, given the small change in litter size. At terminal sacrifice, the avg liver weight & the liver-to-body weight ratio in F0 males exposed to 0.18% TCB were almost twice the control values. In the F1 generation, liver & kidneys were enlarged in both sexes exposed to 0.072% TCB. Sperm abnormalities were greater in the 0.18% TCB group by 40%, compared to controls. Seminal vesicle weight was increased in the high-dose-treated males. The second generation was reared consuming control diet, or diet with 0.072% TCB. At sexual maturity, there was no difference in mating, litter size, pup weight (absolute or adjusted), or dam weight. At F1 necropsy, there was an incr in the absolute & relative weights of liver, kidneys, & testis in the 0.072% TCB group, with similar increases in female liver & kidneys weights. There was no change in F1 female estrual cycle parameters. TCB, under the present experimental conditions, exerted mild reproductive toxicity in the presence of considerable systemic toxicity. Thus, TCB is a reproductive toxicant in the presence of significant systemic toxicity.",

It is a degradation byproduct of pentachlorobenzene and hexachlorobenzene and therefore may enter the environment as a result of the microbial degradation of these compounds. Based on a vapor pressure of 0.005 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated atmospheric half-life of 200 days. 1,2,4,5-Tetrachlorobenzene is expected to have low mobility in soils based upon log Koc values in the range of 3.2-3.9. Volatilization of 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be important based upon the vapor pressure of this compound. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based on the Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-3 atm-cu m/mole at 20 \u00b0C, but adsorption may attenuate this process. Biodegradation of 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene is expected to occur slowly based on a half-life of 47 days in a sewage sludge amended soil and a half-life of 29 days in anaerobic river sediment. In water, 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene is expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its measured Koc values. This compound is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its Henry's Law constant, but adsorption may attenuate this process. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 and 150 hours, respectively if adsorption is neglected. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 34 days when adsorption is considered. When irradiated with light greater than 285 nm, this compound was 61 percent degraded in a water solution in 16 hrs, suggesting that photolysis in surface waters may be important. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is considered high based on BCF values in the range of 1,600 to 4,800 measured in carp and log BCF values of 3.7-4.1 measured in trout. The general population may be exposed to 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 and 150 hours, respectively when neglecting adsorption(5,SRC). The volatilization half-life in a model pond is approximately 34 days when adsorption is considered(7). According to a classification scheme(8), BCF values in the range of 1,600 to 4,800, measured in carp(9) and log BCF values of 3.7-4.1 measured in trout(10), suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Biodegradation is expected to occur slowly based on a half-life of 29 days measured in anaerobic river sediment(11).

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as approximately 150 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life in a model pond is approximately 34 days when adsorption is considered(3). 1,2,4,5-Tetrachlorobenzene's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected, but adsorption may attenuate(SRC). 1,2,4,5-Tetrachlorobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on a vapor pressure of 0.005 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(1).",

The concn on a fat basis of chemical found in the composite samples of carp from the Flint River, MI was not detected/8.6 ppb (duplicate analysis results of the same sample), 150 ppb in the composite sample of carp from Saginaw Bay, MI, and 66/74 ppm in the composite sample of carp from the Saginaw River, MI(5).",

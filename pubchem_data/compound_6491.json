When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Males and females weighed 151 to 159 g and 131 to 146 g, respectively, and were fasted for approximately 16 hours prior to dosing. Rats were observed for signs of toxicity and mortality at frequent intervals during the day of dosing, and twice daily thereafter for a total of 14 days. Body weights were taken on days 0, 7 and 14. At the end of the 14-day observation period, surviving rats were sacrificed and gross necropsies were performed. No signs of toxicity were observed in any of the males throughout the study. On the day of dosing, two females were observed to be slightly to moderately lethargic and slight lacrimation was noted, which subsided by day 1. The females were observed to be normal throughout the remainder of the study. The acute oral LD50 was determined to be greater than 5,000 mg/kg.",

A concurrent control group was administered the basal diet alone. Mice were approximately 43 days old at study initiation. All mice were observed twice daily for mortality and signs of overt toxicity. Detailed physical examinations, individual body weights and food consumption were recorded weekly. The following clinical pathology parameters were evaluated for all mice after 28 consecutive days of test substance administration: hematology (including differential white blood cell count, platelet estimate, red blood cell morphology, white cell estimate and hemoglobin estimate) and serum chemistry (including urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and serum alkaline phosphatase). Clinical necropsy examinations were performed at the scheduled sacrifice and the following organs were weighed: brain, kidneys, liver, ovaries and testes. A microscopic examination was conducted on the following tissues from mice in the control and 50,000 ppm groups: adrenals, bone with marrow, brain, duodenum, gallbladder, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, ovaries with oviducts, peripheral sciatic nerve, pituitary, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testes with epididymides, thyroid and all gross lesions. Evaluation of tissues for the 1000, 5000 and 10,000 ppm groups was limited to kidneys and liver. All animals survived to the scheduled sacrifice. No compound related effect was apparent at any dose level on survival, clinical observations, body weight data, food consumption, hematology parameters, macroscopic or microscopic necropsy findings, or organ weight data. In the serum chemistry parameters, mean serum alkaline phosphatase was statistically significantly increased in the 50,000 ppm group females. However, based on the apparent wide range of biological variability in serum alkaline phosphatase values exhibited in the control group, and the limited sample size in this study, this increase may not be toxicologically meaningful. Systemic toxicity was not apparent at any dose level. The only potential effect ... was increased serum alkaline phosphatase in the female mice at 50,000 ppm.",

There were no treatment-related effects upon mean hatching success or on the survival of fathead minnow larvae during the 28-day post hatch exposure period at any concentration of 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH) tested.

                                                    "String": "5,5-Dimethylhydantoin's production and use as a chemical intermediate may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Its use as an inert ingredient in some pesticide formulations will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.8X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 5,5-dimethylhydantoin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 5,5-dimethylhydantoin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. Particulate-phase 5,5-dimethylhydantoin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 5,5-Dimethylhydantoin does not absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 5,5-dimethylhydantoin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 13. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation half-lives range from 194 days using static tests and sewage inoculum to 5 days using a SCAS test and activated sludge; these diverse test conditions and results indicate that biodegradation may be a slow environmental fate process. If released into water, 5,5-dimethylhydantoin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 5,5-dimethylhydantoin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 5,5-dimethylhydantoin is produced or used. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

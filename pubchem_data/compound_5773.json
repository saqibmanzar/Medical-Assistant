The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

A control group received the injection vehicles only. Urine was collected from all animals daily over 18-hr collection periods, up to 96 hr after treatment. Blood was collected at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr after treatment. At necropsy, kidneys were weighed, processed and examined histopathologically. Results show that methylprednisolone significantly ameliorated the nephrotoxicity of the challenge dose of cephaloridine. Cephaloridine-only treated rats had severe toxic nephrosis characterized by acute tubular necrosis, and elevated blood urea and creatinine. by contrast, the majority of cephaloridine plus methylprednisolone treated rats had only a slight or moderate toxic nephrosis, and had lower blood urea and creatinine levels compared with rats treated with cephaloridine only, indicating preservation of kidney function. Interestingly, rats treated with cephaloridine and methylprednisolone had higher urinary enzymes ... as well as protein and glucose, compared with rats treated with cephaloridine only. this is taken to indicate that rats treated with cephaloridine only had such marked kidney damage and necrosis that the population of cells able to produce these marker enzymes was significantly and rapidly depleted, but the protection afforded by methylprednisolone allowed cephaloridine plus methylprednisolone treated rats to sustain urinary enzyme output. Effects on urinary glucose and other parameters ... demonstrate interactions between glucocorticoid pharmacology and cephaloridine nephrotoxicity.",

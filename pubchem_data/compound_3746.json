When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

As a single agent, ipratropium was indicated for the symptomatic relief of rhinorrhea associated with the common cold or seasonal allergic rhinitis for patients 5 years or older. It does not alleviate nasal congestion nor sneezing.  Rhinorrhea refers to recurrent or chronic watery nasal discharge. This condition is debilitating and its pathogenesis and etiology is complex and not very well understood presenting very substantial cost burden.  Additionally, ipratropium is indicated as a bronchodilator for maintenance treatment of bronchospasm associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes a large number of conditions characterized by breathlessness. As this includes several conditions, the etiology, symptoms, and treatments are diverse.  Ipratropium has also been studied to be used for the treatment of sialorrhea.  Sialorrhea is a common symptom that accompanies different neurologic conditions and it is characterized by drooling or excessive salivation.",

This effect produces the inhibition of the parasympathetic nervous system in the airways and hence, inhibit their function. The function of the parasympathetic system in the airway is to generate bronchial secretions and constriction and hence, the inhibition of this action can lead to bronchodilation and fewer secretions.  At the cellular level, the diameter of the airways is controlled by the release of acetylcholine into the muscle cells causing them to contract and producing a narrow airway. Thus administration of ipratropium stops the activity of acetylcholine in the smooth muscle preventing the contraction and producing relaxed airways.",

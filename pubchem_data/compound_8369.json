ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Mouse primary RGCs were isolated using immunopanning-magnetic separation and exposed to H2O2 in the presence of maltol. The cell viability and apoptosis were determined by using adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling (TUNEL), respectively. Neurite outgrowth was assessed by immunofluorescence for alpha-tubulin. The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was also evaluated using immunofluorescence. When the RGCs were exposed to 20 uM of H2O2 for 16 hr, their viability dropped to 40.3 +/- 3.4%. However, the maltol treatment restored the cells in a dose-dependent manner. The viability recovered to 73.9 +/- 5.1% with 10 uM of maltol and even reached 175.1 +/- 11.3% with 2 mM of maltol, as measured by ATP assay. This oxidative stress significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive RGCs, but the maltol drastically reduced the proportion of those apoptotic cells. The oxidative stress hampered the neurite outgrowth of the RGCs, whereas maltol restored their ability to sprout neurites. Regarding NF-kappaB, the active form of phosphorylated NF-kappaB (pNF-kappaB) increased the oxidative stress level but the maltol treatment again reduced it to an unstressful level. Our data revealed that maltol attenuated the oxidative stress-induced injury in the primary mouse RGCs. Its neuroprotective and neurite outgrowth effects seemed to be related to NF-kappaB signaling. Maltol has potential as a new neuroprotective therapeutic agent for oxidative stress-related ocular diseases, including glaucoma.",

Maltol/iron complex inactivated aconitase the most sensitive enzyme to oxidative stress. The inactivation of aconitase was iron-dependent, and prevented by TEMPOL, a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, suggesting that the maltol/iron-mediated generation of superoxide anion is responsible for the inactivation of aconitase. Addition of maltol effectively enhanced the ascorbate/copper-mediated formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine in DNA. Oxidation of ascorbic acid by CuSO(4) was effectively stimulated by addition of maltol, and the enhanced oxidation rate was markedly inhibited by the addition of catalase and superoxide dismutase. These results suggest that maltol can stimulate the copper reduction coupled with the oxidation of ascorbate, resulting in the production of superoxide radical which in turn converts to hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. Cytotoxic effect of maltol can be explained by its prooxidant properties: maltol/transition metal complex generates reactive oxygen species causing the inactivation of aconitase and the production of hydroxyl radical causing the formation of DNA base adduct.",

We examined the ability of maltol to induce the cytochrome P450 1a1 (Cyp1a1), an enzyme known to play an important role in the chemical activation of xenobiotics to carcinogenic derivatives. Our results showed that treatment of Hepa 1c1c7 cells with maltol significantly induced Cyp1a1 at mRNA, protein, and activity levels in a concentration-dependent manner. The RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, completely blocked the Cyp1a1 mRNA induction by maltol, indicating a requirement of de novo RNA synthesis through transcriptional activation. In addition, maltol induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression in stably transfected H1L1.1c2 cells, suggesting an AhR-dependent mechanism. This is the first demonstration that the food flavoring agent, maltol, can directly induce Cyp1a1 gene expression in an AhR-dependent manner and represents a novel mechanism by which maltol promotes carcinogenicity and toxicity.",

Maltol at a concentration of 130 umol/L inhibited iron-mediated lipid peroxidation and increased scavenging of reactive oxygen species by enhancing the supply of NADPH required for regeneration of GSH. Maltol inhibited the formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances when incubated with rat liver microsomes in the presence of Fe++ and ascorbate. Maltol at concentrations of 130-140 umol/L also effectively inhibited the inactivation of NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, the principal NADPH-generating enzyme, by Fe++. Maltol significantly increased the oxidation of Fe++, while dimethylpyrone had no effect. The latter results suggest that the 3-hydroxy substituent in maltol is necessary to promote Fe++ oxidation.",

It is used as a  flavoring agent, to impart \"freshly baked\" odor and flavor to breads and cakes. It is also used as medication. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Maltol at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 umol/mL induced sister chromatid exchanges in human lymphocytes. It was suggested that these results were due to an indirect action of maltol and not to its direct reactivity with DNA. ANIMAL STUDIES: Eight female mice were fed a diet containing maltol at a level of 0.5% (w/w) for 21 weeks, calculated to provide an average daily intake of 750 mg/kg bw. At termination, no differences in general health, behavior, body-weight gain or relative liver weights were reported. Gross and microscopic examination revealed no histological abnormalities in the livers of the treated mice when compared with the controls. A three-generation study of reproductive toxicity was conducted, in which groups of 20 male and 20 female rats were given diets containing maltol at concentrations resulting in 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg bw per day. On day 134, animals of the F1 generation showed signs of sialodacryodenitis due to a contagious virus. No deaths occurred, and the signs diminished within 10 days. Maltol had no effect on copulation rate, mating viability index, lactation, offspring sex ratio or 21-day pup survival index. Maltol at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 umol/mL induced sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells. It was suggested that these results were due to an indirect action of maltol and not to its direct reactivity with DNA. Maltol was weakly mutagenic (two- to threefold increases in number of revertants) in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 at concentrations of 1-3 mg/plate either alone or with metabolic activation. Activity against TA98 was not detected. Maltol tested at concentrations of 0.1-10.0 mg/plate increased the number of revertants in strain TA97 at 1 mg/plate by about twofold. No increase found in the presence of an activation system, or in TA102 alone or with activation. In other studies with S. typhimurium, maltol was not consistently mutagenic when tested at concentrations up to 10,000 ug/plate alone or in the presence of an activation system.",

The resulting 1:3 (metal-ligand) complexes, being neutral, are able to partition readily across cell membranes and thus may facilitate iron transport across the intestinal wall. Absorption of radioactive iron ((59)Fe) in the presence of these pyrones was investigated in male rats 1, 2, 4 and 6 hr after intraduodenal administration of a 7 micrograms dose and compared with that of (59)Fe given as the sulfate, gluconate, fumarate or complexed to EDTA. Total body absorption and distribution were calculated from the (59)Fe content of various tissue samples. With all the iron preparations used, blood levels of (59)Fe were highest 1 hr after injection whilst the (59)Fe content at the major site of deposition, i.e. the bone marrow, increased up to 6 hr. No (59)Fe was found in the urine. Total body absorption of (59)Fe was significantly higher from the pyrones than from the other four preparations. Over the dose range 0.7-700 micrograms, the proportion of (59)Fe absorbed from both iron maltol and iron sulphate decreased with increasing dose. Enhanced (59)Fe uptake from maltol was evident at 0.7-70 micrograms but not at 700 micrograms suggesting that use of these pyrones will not result in iron overload. Absorption of (59)Fe given into the stomach was slower in onset but was sustained longer presumably via a steady delivery of iron to the duodenum from the gastric reservoir.",

Impairment of axonal transport is thought to be a mechanism of toxicity. Inhibition of the degradation of neurofilament proteins, however, resulting in accumulation of these proteins may be an alternative mechanism for Al toxicity. In the present study, the effect of calcium (Ca) on the proteolysis of the neurofilament triplet proteins by calcium-activated neutral proteases (CANP) was studied in the isolated sciatic nerve explants. The extent of the degradation was found to be dependent on the Ca concentration. The effect of Al chloride, -citrate and -maltol on the calcium-induced degradation was studied. No effect of any of the Al compounds was observed, suggesting that the metal may exert its neurotoxic effect via a mechanism other than impairment of neurofilament proteolysis. Maltol itself was found to enhance the effect of Ca on the degradation of neurofilament proteins, probably by facilitating the movement of Ca across the neuronal membrane.",

Although citric acid is known to be a strong enhancer of gastrointestinal absorption of aluminum, its effect on aluminum distribution and accumulation is not yet clear. Maltol has been shown to increase the neurotoxicity of aluminum, but little is known about its effect on aluminum deposition in the body. To elucidate the role of citric acid and maltol in aluminum accumulation and toxicity, rats were loaded intraperitoneally during a 7-day period with different amounts of aluminum chloride in absence or presence of citric acid or maltol before analysis of aluminum in serum, brain, bone, and urine. Coadministration of citric acid led to relatively reduced serum levels, as compared with aluminum and aluminum-maltol treatment. This is explained by both tissue elimination and enhanced renal elimination. ... Maltol was shown to be a strong enhancer of aluminum accumulation in serum, brain, and bone. The rise of aluminum in these target tissues was dose dependent.",

We report maltol toxicity in neuroblastoma cell lines of mouse (Neuro 2a) and human (IMR 32) origin, and in primary murine fetal hippocampal neuronal cultures. As determined by MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2 -(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt] conversion, maltol exhibited a dose-dependent toxicity on the viability of both neuroblastoma cell lines, but the toxicity was more pronounced in Neuro 2a cells. Maltol was also toxic in a dose-dependent manner in primary murine fetal hippocampal neurons at micromolar concentrations. Electrophoresis of DNA extracted from maltol-intoxicated cells showed a laddering pattern, suggestive of apoptotic cell death. In the maltol-exposed hippocampal neuronal cultures, fragmented DNA ends were visualized in situ in morphologically condensed nuclei by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase with digoxigenin-labelled UTP and subsequent immunohistochemistry. Collectively, our findings suggest that the toxic effect of maltol is mediated through apoptosis. ...",

Body weights were recorded weekly. Hematological examinations (hemoglobin, erythrocyte volume fraction and red blood cell count), ophthalmological examinations, renal function (measured by the bromosulfphthalein excretion test) and clinical chemistry (blood urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, total bilirubin and glucose) were evaluated at the beginning of the study and on days 14, 30, 60 and 90. At necropsy, major organs (heart, lung, liver, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, thymus, adrenals, thyroid, brain, pituitary, testes, epididymes, seminal vesicles, prostate, uterus and ovary) were removed and weighed. Selected tissues (brain, cervical spinal cord, sciatic nerve, hypophysis, eye, optic nerve, thyroid and parathyroid, thymus, heart, lung, carinal node, sternum, rib, brachial plexus, aorta, liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal, stomach, small and large intestine, mesenteric node, all levels of male and female reproductive tracts, kidneys, urinary bladder, femoral bone marrow, skeletal muscle, submaxillary gland, mammary gland and tongue) were evaluated microscopically. Three of four animals (sex not specified) at 500 mg/kg bw per day died within 21-41 days, and the fourth was killed when it became moribund. The symptoms before death included weight loss, episcleritis, icteric mucous membranes, emesis, ataxia and prostration. Two dogs (sex not specified) had decreased hemoglobin concentrations, erythrocyte volume fractions and red blood cell counts and increased blood urea nitrogen. Three dogs (sex not specified) had elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities, and all four (sex not specified) had increased bilirubin levels. Pathological examination of the tissues revealed pulmonary edema, hepatic and adrenal cortical and medullary necrosis, fatty degeneration of the myocardium and testicular degeneration. Except for slight decreases in hemoglobin, erythrocyte volume fraction, red blood cell count and bilirubin values at 250 mg/kg bw per day, no effects were reported at 125 or 250 mg/kg bw per day.

Concurrent control groups of an unspecified number of male and female rats were maintained on basal diet. Body weight and food consumption were recorded weekly. Blood and urine samples were collected from five male and five female rats in each group 45 and 90 days after the beginning of the study. Blood samples were analyzed for hemoglobin, erythrocyte volume fraction, red blood cell count, total white blood cell count and differential count. Urine samples were analyzed for color, volume, specific gravity, pH, blood, albumin and glucose, and the sediment was examined microscopically after centrifugation. At the end of the study, all rats were necropsied; organ weights were recorded (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, adrenals, thyroid, brain, hypophysis, uterus and ovaries), and gross and microscopic examinations were made of brain, cervical spinal cord, hypophysis, eye, parotid gland, thyroid and parathyroid, adrenals, thymus, heart, lung, sternum, rib, aorta, liver, spleen, pancreas, stomach, small and large intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, reproductive tract, kidneys, urinary bladder, skeletal muscle, femoral nerve, femoral bone marrow, skin and mammary gland. Decreased body-weight gain was reported in males and females after weeks 3 and 9, respectively, the male rats being more severely affected. A decrease in hemoglobin and slightly amber-colored serum were observed in one male and one female at study termination. A high incidence of albuminuria was observed in all treated rats. No significant gross pathological changes were detected, and no differences between test and control animals in organ weights were recorded. Microscopic examination revealed kidney lesions identified as dilated acellular glomerular tufts with protein extravasation into Bowman capsules and cast formation within the lumina of dilated corticomedullary tubules. The deaths of two of the treated rats were attributed by the authors to renal failure.",

A concurrent control group was maintained. Food and water were provided ad libitum, and body weights were recorded weekly. At termination, no differences in general health, behavior, body-weight gain or relative liver weights were reported. Gross and microscopic examination revealed no histological abnormalities in the livers of the treated mice when compared with the controls.",

Maltol has been detected in emissions from burning wood and in tobacco smoke and substitute-tobacco smoke. Maltol is found in the bark of young larch trees, in pine needles, in chickory, in wood tars and oils, and in roasted malt. Maltol is found in a variety of plants including clover, ginseng, licorice, pepper, paprika and raspberry. If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 3.26X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates maltol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase maltol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Maltol absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, maltol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Maltol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure, however, the compound does have a characteristic odor. Biodegradation data in soil and water were not available. If released into water, maltol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Photooxidation may occur in surface waters exposed to sunlight with a half-life on the order of 25 days. Occupational exposure to maltol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where maltol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to maltol via inhalation of air in the vicinity of burning wood or tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and beverages, and dermal contact with consumer products containing maltol.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its extrapolated vapor pressure, 3.26X10-4 mm Hg(2), and water solubility, 1.09X10+4 mg/L(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.09(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2016). Maltol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Maltol is an olefinic compound and olefins in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants with a half-life on the order of 25 days(7).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of maltol with ozone has been estimated as 1.3X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 21 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). Maltol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). The UV absorption spectrum of maltol in methanol solution shows weak absorption between 290-340 nm(3) and, therefore, maltol may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). It has been reported that maltol may be sensitive to prolonged exposure to light(4). Maltol is an olefinic compound and olefins in surface waters exposed to sunlight react with photo-oxidants (such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxy radicals and singlet oxygen) with a half-life on the order of 25 days(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Volatiles emitted from rice cakes from two commercial companies contained maltol levels of 29 and 60 ppb respectively(3). Maltol was identified at concentrations ranging from 35.5 to 209 ug/L in red wines aged in wooden barrels(4). Maltol was identified in volatiles from roasted chestnuts(5). The volatile compounds extracted from the red-skinned cultivar of rambutan, Jitlee (Nephelium lappaceum L.), a tropical fruit native to Southeast Asia, contained a maltol concentration of 53.79 ug/L in the juice(6).",

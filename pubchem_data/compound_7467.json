PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The officer accidentally discharged the tear gas from a container he kept in his right trouser pocket, and immediately washed the site of contact with water for 5 minutes. A localized erythema with a burning sensation occurred instantly on the right upper thigh and a blistering reaction developed within 2 days. After 2 weeks of treatment with a topical steroid, the center of the lesion was faint, but the borders had extended and persisted for 4 weeks. Testing with chloroacetophenone and orthochlorbenzylidine malonitrile one month after symptoms disappeared gave positive test results to chloroacetophenone but negative to orothochlorbenzylidine malonitrile. The normal exposure to this compound as a gas has not been reported to cause sensitivity reactions except in 1 in about 10,000 servicemen exposed in gas chamber drills. However, application of this compound in high concentration and in the presence of moisture indicates that it is a powerful skin irritant as evidenced not only by this report but by other earlier reports in literature. /Chloroacetophenone/",

The level of plasma urea was unaltered. o-Chloroacetophenone exposed animals did not show any significant changes in plasma SGOT, acid and alkaline phosphatase activities at different intervals. However, in dibenz(b,f)-1,4-oxazepine exposed animals, a significant elevation of the activities of SGOT, GPT, acid and alkaline phosphatase was observed at different intervals. All the parameters became normal within seven days after the exposure. Inhalation of dibenz(b,f)-1,4-oxazepine aerosols can thus lead to tissue damaging effects in rats. /o-Chloroacetophenone/",

The basis of this method was total and differential feeding by bees at 30% sugar water and chemical sugar solutions. This method provided an indication to the extent and manner of response of the olfacto-gustatory system to the repellent chemicals. The lower concentrations exercised less repellency while higher concentrations worked in the opposite direction. However, the increase in repellency was limited to a certain concentration, then the increase almost stabilized. Out of all the compounds, p-bromoacetophenone showed higher repellency.",

Exposure to 2-chloroacetophenone vapor causes rapid exocytosis of acinar cell granules as well as vacuolation of the secretory and ductal epithelial cells. Concomitantly, intralobular ductal epithelial cells which are normally cuboidal in shape, enlarge in size and release electron dense granules into the duct lumen. Within 15 min after exposure, acinar cells show a preponderance of cells containing only pale granules and the ductal epithelium returns to a more cuboidal shape. By 60 min after exposure, the gland is not readily distinguishable from the unexposed, control gland. /2-Chloroacetophenone/",

The substance was either applied to the center or to the limbus, or simultaneously to the center and limbus of the cornea. After surgical removal of the cornea on day 21, the alterations were examined by a light microscope. When chloracetophenone was applied to the middle of the cornea, signs of intensified epithelial regeneration were observed, even to the point of a severe granulating and necrotic infection with ulceration. The severity of these changes depended on the concentration used and showed that repair of a corneal defect had been attempted. The same changes were observed when the same concentrations of chloracetophenone were applied to the limbus, but with greater severity. Some of these alterations led to perforation of the cornea when the substance was applied to center and limbus. These results are discussed in reference to the correlation of the changes seen in animal tests to those in the human eye. /Chloroacetophenone/",

It may be released to the environment as a fugitive emission during it production and use, in wastewater effluent, and as an emission from improperly regulated kerosene heaters. If released to soil, an estimated soil adsorption coefficient of 436 indicates that p-chloroacetophenone will display moderate mobility in soil. It is expected to rapidly volatilize from moist soil to the atmosphere, but only slowly volatilize from dry soil. If released to water, p-chloroacetophenone is expected to rapidly volatilize to the atmosphere. The estimated half-life for volatilization of p-chloroacetophenone from a model river is 4.8 hrs. p-Chloroacetophenone will not bioconcentrate in fish and aquatic organisms although it may weakly adsorb to sediment and suspended organic matter. If released to the atmosphere, p-chloroacetophenone is expected to undergo slow atmospheric removal by a gas-phase reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals. An estimated half-life for this process is 13.8 days. Occupational exposure to p-chloroacetophenone may occur by inhalation or dermal contact during its production, formulation and use. Members of the general population may be exposed to p-chloroacetophenone during the use of improperly maintained kerosene space heaters. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

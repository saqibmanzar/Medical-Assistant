PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

These include the reaction of nitrocresol with aqueous ammonia, the catalytic hydrogenation of aromatic nitro compounds in the presence of Raney copper, reacting aromatic nitro compounds with hydrogen sulfide in the presence of ammonia dissolved in dioxane, reacting 2,4-dinitrotoluene with hydrogen sulfide in a pyridine solution, and reacting 2,4-dinitrotoluene with carbon monoxide in the presence of cupric oxide and manganese dioxide... . 5-Nitro-ortho-toluidine has also been synthesized by the nitration of ortho-toluidine and the monoreduction of 2,4-dinitrotoluene with alcoholic ammonium sulfide ... . It can be prepared by the electrolytic reduction of ortho-nitrotoluene to orthotoluidine sulfate and subsequent nitration",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Blood biochemistry tests indicated liver damage in seven of 15 study subjects. Workers who handled 5-nitro-o-toluidine and nitrosyl sulfuric acid often loosened their respiratory protective equipment shortly after 5-nitro-o-toluidine powder had been dispersed into the air of the room. No potential hepatotoxins were present except for 5-nitro-o-toluidine. Six of the affected workers had handled 5-nitro-o-toluidine 12 to 20 times; the seventh worker had handled the powder three times; and the other eight workers without liver dysfunction had handled the material once or twice. No other significant differences in background were evident between the affected and unaffected workers, such as age, sex, or protective measures. Histological findings during recovery from liver damage were similar to those of acute viral hepatitis. None of the 15 subjects has demonstrated liver damage since the factory was closed. ...",

None of the 5 noncarcinogens yielded significant transformation at any of the doses tested. Therefore, the concordance between the pH 6.7 SHE cell transformation assay and rodent carcinogenicity for these 10 single ring aromatic/nitroaromatic amine compounds is 100%. In contrast, the concordance between the standard SHE cell transformation assay and rodent carcinogenicity for 13 single ring aromatic/nitroaromatic amine compounds was 62%. For 5 aromatic/nitroaromatic amine compounds which were tested in both standard and pH 6.7 SHE cell transformation assays (i.e., a subset of the above two databases), the concordance between the standard SHE cell transformation assay and the rodent bioassay was 40%, while the concordance between the pH 6.7 SHE cell transformation assay and the rodent bioassay was 100%. This relatively high concordance between the pH 6.7 SHE cell transformation assay and rodent bioassay results demonstrates the utility of the pH 6.7 SHE cell transformation assay for predicting the rodent carcinogenic potential of single ring aromatic/nitroaromatic amine compounds."

The time-weighted average high and low dietary concentrations of 5-nitro-o-toluidine were, respectively, 0.01 and 0.005 percent for rats, and 0.23 and 0.12 percent for mice. After a 78-week period of compound administration, observation of the rats continued for an additional 30 to 31 weeks and observation of the mice continued for up to an additional 20 weeks. ... There were no significant positive associations between the concentration of 5-nitro-o-toluidine administered and mortality in rats or mice of either sex, and adequate numbers of animals in all groups survived sufficiently long to be at risk from late-developing tumors. No unusual tumors were observed in rats of either sex and no convincing statistical evidence was provided for a significant positive association between compound administration and the incidence of any neoplasm in rats. Among mice there was a statistically significant positive association between administration of the chemical and the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas in both males and females. The combined incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in male mice and the incidence of hemangiosarcomas in female mice were not statistically significant in relation to their respective control groups. However, they were considered to be associated with compound administration since they rarely occur in untreated B6C3F1 mice. Under the conditions of this bioassay 5-nitro-o-toluidine was carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, causing hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes, an increase in the combined incidence of hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in male mice, and an increased incidence of hemangiosarcomas in female mice. The compound was not carcinogenic in Fischer 344 rats.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.8X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 5-nitro-o-toluidine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 5-nitro-o-toluidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 days. 5-Nitro-o-toluidine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 5-nitro-o-toluidine is expected to have low mobility based upon Koc values of 690 and 810 measured in sewage sludge. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 5-Nitro-o-toluidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. 5-Nitro-o-toluidine was reported to degrade 100% after 104 days in studies using activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant with no previous exposure to nitroaromatic compounds, as well as in studies using inoculum from a plant that routinely treats dinitrotoluene contaminated wastewater. If released into water, 5-nitro-o-toluidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 5.5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 5-nitro-o-toluidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 5-nitro-o-toluidine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

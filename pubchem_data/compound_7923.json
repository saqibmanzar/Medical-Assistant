PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Examples of industrially important copolymers are: MA-styrene (for engineering plastics) and MA-acrylic acid (used in the detergent industry). Polyester and alkyd resins, in particular, are used in the production of fiberglass reinforced plastics, in the construction and electrical industries, and in pipeline and marine construction. ... Smaller amounts of MA are used in the production of pesticides (captan, malathion) and growth inhibitors (maleic acid hydrazide). ... When added to drying oils, MA reduces the drying time and improves the coating quality of lacquers.",

Exposure to maleic anhydride may occur from accidental releases to the environment or in workplaces where it is produced or used.

Chronic (long-term) exposure to maleic anhydride has been observed to cause chronic bronchitis, asthma-like attacks, and upper respiratory tract and eye irritation in workers. In some people, allergies have developed so that lower concentrations can no longer be tolerated. Kidney effects were observed in rats chronically exposed to maleic anhydride via gavage (experimentally placing the chemical in the stomach).

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Undergoes violent exothermic decomposition reactions, producing carbon dioxide, in the presence of strong bases (sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide), alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium), aliphatic amines (dimethylamine, trimethylamine), aromatic amines (pyridine, quinoline) at temperatures above 150 \u00b0C [Vogler, C. A. et al., J. Chem. Eng. Data, 1963, 8, p. 620]. A 0.1% solution of pyridine (or other tertiary amine) in maleic anhydride at 185 \u00b0C gives an exothermic decomposition with rapid evolution of gas [Chem Eng. News 42(8); 41 1964]. Maleic anhydride is known as an excellent dienophile in the Diels-Alder reaction to produce phthalate ester derivatives. These reactions can be extremely violent, as in the case of 1-methylsilacyclopentadiene [J. Organomet., Chem., 1979, 179, c19]. Maleic anhydride undergoes a potentially explosive exothermic Diels-Alder reaction with 1-methylsilacyclopenta-2,4-diene at 150C [Barton, T. J., J. Organomet. Chem., 1979, 179, C19], and is considered an excellent dieneophile for Diels-Alder reactions [Felthouse, Timothy R. et al. \"Maleic Anhydride, Maleic Acid, and Fumaric Acid.\" Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2005].",

Maleic anhydride is an intermediate, which is used in a wide range of products, mainly in the manufacture of unsaturated polyester resins. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Maleic anhydride is irritating to skin in humans. Severe skin burns and itching have been reported following dermal contact. Dust or vapor has been reported to cause conjunctivitis, inflammation and swelling of the eyelids, severe lacrymation and photophobia. Case reports of respiratory irritation, and feelings of nasal irritation and pulmonary discomfort in a volunteer study indicate that maleic anhydride is a respiratory irritant. In the volunteer study, impairment of smell was also reported. A single worker showed a positive skin reaction to a patch test, indicating that skin sensitisation was present. Repeated exposure of workers is associated with asthma as evidenced by a number of case reports. It is not known if the asthma has an immunological background. ANIMAL STUDIES: Inhalation exposure for 6 hours to up to 199 mg/cu m of maleic anhydride vapor did not cause mortality in rats. At the highest concentration, signs of eye and nose irritation were observed. Direct contact with maleic anhydride powder caused severe skin irritation in rabbits, and a 1% solution was highly irritating to their eyes. The principal effects identified in four-week and six-month inhalation studies in rats, hamsters, and Rhesus monkeys were lesions in the respiratory tract including the nose, trachea and lungs. In two rat studies (90 days or 90 and 183 days), dietary administration of maleic anhydride resulted in nephritis. In a two-generation rat study with gavage administration, no effects on fertility were found, however the pregnancy rate of the control group was exceptionally low (50-70%). The only developmental effect seen was a slight reduction in body-weight of pups from the first litter of the first generation, at this dose level (150 mg/kg b.w./day) severe toxicity including mortality was found in the parental animals. Maleic anhydride was negative in the Ames test. An in vitro chromosome aberration test showed a positive effect. An in vivo chromosome aberration test was negative. No treatment-related differences in tumor incidence were found in a dietary carcinogenicity study in rats. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Median tolerance limit for Gambusia affinis (mosquitofish) was found to be 240 mg/L/24 or 48 hr and 230 mg/L/96 hr in a static test done in pond water of high turbidity; 20-23 \u00b0C, pH 5.8-8.0, aerated; fish treated with terramycin to prevent or treat tail-rot disease.  The LC100 was 320 mg/L/24 hr.",

To determine median lethal dose (LD50), the compounds were introduced into the stomachs of white-mice or white-rats in a 3% starch solution. The data was treated by probit analysis. The LD50 for the mixture was 3210 mg/kg for white-mice and 5480 mg/kg for white-rats. The LD50 of maleic-anhydride for these species was 465 mg/kg and 850 mg/kg, respectively. The combined actions of the mixture and maleic-anhydride were studied at their LD50s in 90 white-mice. The biological effect of the combined administration equaled the sum expected from the addition of the toxic effect of each substance. To explain any cumulative properties of the mixture and maleic-anhydride, white-rats were treated orally for 20 days with 3% starch solutions of 0.1 LD50 of the mixture in the first group, 0.1 LD50 maleic-anhydride in the second group, 0.05 LD50 of each in the third group, and only starch solution in the fourth, control group. No animals died, but toward the end of the experiment, all test animals were less active than controls. Cholinesterase activity was not altered in any group. The threshold doses for depression of blood cholinesterase was determined to be 0.152 mg/L for maleic-anhydride and 0.126 mg/L for the mixture. When these doses were combined and administered to white-rats, an additive depression of cholinesterase activity was seen. .../It was concluded/ that the toxic effects of the mixture and maleic-anhydride are additive.",

At 0.005-0.007 mg/L the odor is perceptible and an irritating effect is noted. At 0.002-0.003 mg/L: slightly perceptible, irritating effect almost absent. Olfactory threshold: 0.0013 mg/L with irritation of the mucous membranes. Persons breathing these concentrations complained of throat dryness and irritation. Breathing below this threshold value led still to a throat irritation. A concentration </= 0.0009 mg/L was without any effect. At a chemical plant producing maleic and phthalic anhydride samples were taken during one spring and one summer season at distances of 500, 1000 and 2000 m.

It has been suggested that in-situ formation of maleic anhydride in the ambient atmosphere may be possible via photooxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene); the hydrolysis product of maleic anhydride has been found in rainwater samples. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.25 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates maleic anhydride will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase maleic anhydride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone molecules and nitrate radicals with half-lives 11 days, 6.5 days and 8 hours, respectively. Atmospheric reaction with nitrate radicals is an important night time sink for maleic anhydride. Maleic anhydride absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, maleic anhydride is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. However, maleic anhydride hydrolyzes rapidly in water forming maleic acid. Therefore, potential leaching in soil is expected to be dominated by degradation to maleic acid. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process due to hydrolysis. Maleic anhydride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Various biodegradation screening tests have found maleic anhydride to be readily biodegradable. However, available biodegradation rates for maleic anhydride are expected to reflect the hydrolysis product maleic acid. If released into water, maleic anhydride will hydrolyze rapidly with half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C, respectively. Volatilization from surface waters and bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is unlikely due rapid hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to maleic anhydride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where maleic anhydride is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to maleic anhydride via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

However, maleic anhydride hydrolyzes rapidly in water forming maleic acid with hydrolysis half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C respectively(3). Therefore, potential leaching in soil is expected to be dominated by degradation to maleic acid(SRC). Volatilization of maleic anhydride from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process due to hydrolysis(SRC). Maleic anhydride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.25 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). Various biodegradation screening tests have found maleic anhydride to be readily biodegradable(5,6). However, available biodegradation rates for maleic anhydride are expected to reflect the hydrolysis product maleic acid(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). However, maleic anhydride hydrolyzes rapidly in water forming maleic acid with hydrolysis half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C, respectively(3). Therefore, volatilization is not expected to be an important fate process in water due to hydrolysis(SRC). Bioconcentration of maleic anhydride in aquatic organisms is unlikely due its rapid hydrolysis(SRC). Various biodegradation screening tests have found maleic anhydride to be readily biodegradable(5,6). However, available biodegradation rates for maleic anhydride are expected to reflect the hydrolysis product maleic acid(SRC).",

Vapor-phase maleic anhydride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.45X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 23 \u00b0C(3). Vapor-phase maleic anhydride is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.5 days, calculated from its estimated rate constant of 0.18X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C that was derived using a structure estimation method(4). The nitrate radical (NO3) is the dominant atmospheric oxidant during the night-time in most atmospheric environments(5). Vapor-phase maleic anhydride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with nitrate radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.0X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(6). Removal of maleic anhydride via reaction with hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrate radicals leads to the formation of dicarbonyls(7). Maleic anhydride absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). In the vapor phase, hydrolysis of maleic anhydride is completed in 21 hr at 96% relative humidity while no hydrolysis occurs at 50% relative humidity(8).",

Using OECD Guideline 301B (Ready Biodegradability: CO2 Evolution Test), maleic anhydride was found to be readily biodegradable with CO2 evolution rates of 61.6% after 4 days and 93.2% after 11 days(2); it was noted that maleic anhydride hydrolyzes under the test conditions and, as a result, maleic acid is believed to be the test material investigated in the study(2). Another OECD Guideline 301B test determined >90% CO2 evolution within 25 days(2). Using OECD Guideline 301E (Ready Biodegradability: Modified OECD Screening Test) and a non-adapted activated sludge inoculum, maleic anhydride was found to be readily biodegradable with a 73-81% removal after 28 days(2). The TOC and COD-Mn of maleic anhydride, present at 170 mg/L in industrial wastewater, was reduced by 98% and 99%, respectively, after 1 day of acclimation with an activated sludge inocculum from a waste water treatment plant(3). In one report 99% removal was achieved in 4 hr by activated sludge(4). Others report 40-60% theoretical BOD in 5 days with sewage inoculum(5,6). The data suggest that maleic anhydride is expected to biodegrade rapidly(SRC); however, maleic anhydride hydrolyzes rapidly in water forming maleic acid with hydrolysis half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C, respectively(7). Therefore, the available biodegradation rates are expected to correspond primarily to maleic acid(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 11 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of maleic anhydride with ozone has been estimated as 0.18X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of maleic anhydride with atmospheric nitrate radicals is reported as 1.0X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 8 hours(SRC) at a nighttime atmospheric concentration of 2.5X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(4). Maleic anhydride absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Maleic anhydride hydrolyzes in water at room temperature forming maleic acid(5). The first-order hydrolysis rate constants, in initially neutral solution, at 0 and 25.1 \u00b0C were measured as 0.00348 and 0.03140 per second(6) which correspond to half-lives of 3.32 and 0.37 minutes respectively(SRC). In the vapor phase, hydrolysis of maleic anhydride is completed in 21 hr at 96% relative humidity while no hydrolysis occurs at 50% relative humidity(7).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

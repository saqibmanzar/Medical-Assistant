When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The hexacarbon compounds methyl n-butyl ketone, 2,5-hexanedione and etc were shown to be neurotoxic like n-hexane. Therefore, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane and methylcyclopentane which are also hexacarbon compounds were suspected to be neurotoxic, but their neurotoxicity had not been sufficiently investigated. The present experiment was performed to clarify their neurotoxicity by measuring the nerve conduction velocity in the rat's tail. Thirty rats were divided into five groups of 5-7 rats. n-Hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane and methylcyclopentane were diluted with olive oil and orally administered daily for eight weeks. The body weight, motor nerve conduction velocity, motor distal latency and mixed nerve conduction velocity were measured before administration, after two, four, six and eight weeks administration. The n-hexane group showed a distinct impairment of the functional states of the peripheral nerve. Methylcyclopentane, 2-methylpentane, and 3-methylpentane group had some significant differences in comparison with the control in the experiment, although these differences were not so distinct as those in n-hexane group. The results revealed that the neurotoxicity of the three chemicals was not so severe as that of n-hexane and were in the order of n-hexane greater than methylcyclopentane greater than or equal to 2-methylpentane divided by 3-methylpentane.",

Male and female CD (Sprague-Dawley) rats were exposed to commercial hexane vapor at target concentrations of 0, 900, 3000, or 9000 ppm for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, over two generations. At both the F0 breed to produce Fl litters and the Fl breed to produce F2 litters, reproductive parameters were unaffected by commercial hexane exposure. Litter size and postnatal survival were not significantly different between exposure groups. However, reductions in body weight and body weight gain were observed in both Fl and F2 litters exposed to 9000 ppm. Effects on body weight were not observed in offspring exposed to the two lower concentrations of commercial hexane. Histopathologic examination of selected organs revealed hyaline droplet nephropathy in adult F0 and Fl males exposed to 9000 ppm commercial hexane. No other treatment related lesions were observed. In summary exposure of rats to commercial hexane for two generations resulted in reduced body weight gains at 9000 ppm but no adverse effects on reproduction. The NOEL for this study was 3000 ppm.",

Methylcyclopentane has been identified in numerous environmental samples including emissions from automobiles, drinking water, surface water, industrial effluents, atmospheric samples, and sediments. It has also been detected as an indoor pollutant from various household products, as volatile component of baked potatoes and beef, in mother's milk and in human expired air. If released to soil, methylcyclopentane should have low mobility. Volatilization of methylcyclopentane will be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of methylcyclopentane in soil or water. If released to water, methylcyclopentane should adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Methylcyclopentane will volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of 2.7 hours and 3.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 210 suggests that methylcyclopentane will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. If released to the atmosphere, methylcyclopentane will exist primarily in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase methylcyclopentane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2.3 days. Particulate-phase methylcyclopentane may be physically removed from the air by wet deposition. (SRC)",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Of these microorganisms, 32 pure cultures were isolated that used gasoline as a sole source of carbon; however, none used methylcyclopentane when cultured in basal mineral salts medium(2). When Sunoco 260 was added to Ambler water, methylcyclopentane showed only a 10% drop in concentration after 192 hours(2). When methylcyclopentane was incubated with Nocardia sp 802-6, 802-29, and 802-9 along with hexadecane as a co-oxidation growth substrate on agar-resin plates, no oxidation products of sufficient quantity for identification were found(2). When the fermentation was carried out in an aqueous system, similar results were obtained(2).

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Levels of methylcyclopentane from jet engine exhaust from flight condition simulation experiments using two engine types (YJ93-GE-3 and J85-GE-SB) ranged from 0.06-6.9 ppm C depending on where in the exhaust stream the measurement was taken(2). Average methylcyclopentane concns taken from 8 trips in a car (6 trips in a new car and 2 trips in older cars) and in a commuter train were 5.0 and 0.8 ug/cu m, respectively(3). Exhaust samples from 67 different automobiles with no emission control devices were found to contain an average of 1% wt/wt methylcyclopentane(4). The concn of methylcyclopentane in gasoline vapors from refueling cars at service stations ranged between 0.006 and 0.88 ppm(5). The average percentages of methylcyclopentane in three gasoline vapors are: Amoco Oil (bulk terminal exposure), 1.1 wt%; Amoco Oil (marine loading exposure), 1.5 wt%; and Shell Oil, 1.3 vol%(6). A study conducted in Atlanta (1990) found the average concn of methylcyclopentane in roadway, whole gas (average of six octanes), whole gas (87 octane), whole gas (89 octane), whole gas (92/93 octane), headspace gas (at 24 \u00b0C and average of six octanes), headspace gas (at 32 \u00b0C and average of six octanes), airport, and aircraft emissions were: 0.783, 1.10, 1.31, 1.04, 0.6, 0.81, 0.86, 0.6, and 0.344 ppbC%, respectively(7).",

A study conducted in Chicago found the average concn of methylcyclopentane in regular fuel (87 octane), mid-grade (89 octane), premium (93 octane), hot soak, cold start, roadway, and petroleum refinery emissions to be 0.98, 0.84, 0.34, 1.17, 1.65, 1.22, and 0.83 wt%, respectively(2). In Southern California, the methylcyclopentane profile for various emissions for vehicle exhaust was 0.92, 1.77, 0.77, 0.00, 0.83, and 0.86 wt% for a 46 car study, 13 samples from the Caldecott Tunnel, cold start, stabilized, hot start, and from an older fleet, respectively(3). Gasoline emission profiles for methylcyclopentane are as follows: 0.69, 1.14, 0.20, 2.44, 2.19, 1.08, and 1.49 wt% for diurnal evaporative emissions (older fleet), hot soak evaporative emissions (older fleet), running loss (older fleet), summer liquid gas, winter liquid gas, summer gas headspace, and winter gas headspace, respectively(3). In oil field emissions (Tulsa, OK), methylcyclopentane was detected at average concn of 164.6 ppbC and approximately 85 ppbC for two different samples(4). A study conducted along US Highway 70 near Raleigh, NC detected methylcyclopentane in automobile emissions at average percents of 1.17, 1.09, 1.13, 1.22, 1.03, and 1.00 %ppbC at five different sites(5). Samples of air taken from the Tingstad Tunnel in Goteborg, Sweden, on five different days, contained methylcyclopentane at 1.6, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, and 1.9% of non-methane volatile hydrocarbons(6). Methylcyclopentane composition in the vapor of different types of petrol is 2.2 (conventional \"cracked\" Statoil 95), 2.6 (conventional \"reformate\" Shell 95), 0.2 (reformulated \"alkylate\" Aspen 2T), and 0.04% (reformulated \"alkylate\" OK Special)(7).",

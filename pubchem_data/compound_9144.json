PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

To determine the importance of their contributions to the total mutagenic activity of combustion and pyrolysis samples in which they are found, we characterized reference quantities of four C18H10 CP-PAHs: benzo[ghi]fluoranthene (BF), cyclopenta[cd]pyrene (CPP), cyclopent[hi]acephenanthrylene (CPAP), and cyclopent[hi]aceanthrylene (CPAA). Synthesis of CPAA and CPAP is described. The availability of reference samples of these isomers also proved to be an essential aid in the identification of the C18H10 species often found in combustion and pyrolysis samples. Chemical analysis of selected combustion and pyrolysis samples showed that CPP was generally the most abundant C18H10 isomer, followed by CPAP and BF. CPAA was detected only in pyrolysis products from pure PAHs. We tested the four C18H10 PAHs for mutagenicity in a forward mutation assay using S. typhimurium. CPP, BF, and CPAA were roughly twice as mutagenic as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), whereas CPAP was only slightly active. These PAHs were also tested for mutagenic activity in human cells. In this assay, CPP and CPAA were strongly mutagenic but less active than BaP, whereas CPAP and BF were inactive at the dose levels tested. Also, the bacterial and human cell mutagenicity of CPAA and CPAP were compared with the mutagenicity of their monocyclopenta-fused analogs, aceanthrylene and acephenanthyrlene. Although the mutagenicities of CPAP and acephenanthrylene are similar, the mutagenic activity of CPAA is an order of magnitude greater than that of aceanthyrlene.",

To determine the importance of their contributions to the total mutagenic activity of combustion and pyrolysis samples in which they are found, we characterized reference quantities of four C18H10 CP-PAHs: benzo[ghi]fluoranthene (BF), cyclopenta[cd]pyrene (CPP), cyclopent[hi]acephenanthrylene (CPAP), and cyclopent[hi]aceanthrylene (CPAA). Synthesis of CPAA and CPAP is described. The availability of reference samples of these isomers also proved to be an essential aid in the identification of the C18H10 species often found in combustion and pyrolysis samples. Chemical analysis of selected combustion and pyrolysis samples showed that CPP was generally the most abundant C18H10 isomer, followed by CPAP and BF. CPAA was detected only in pyrolysis products from pure PAHs. We tested the four C18H10 PAHs for mutagenicity in a forward mutation assay using S. typhimurium. CPP, BF, and CPAA were roughly twice as mutagenic as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), whereas CPAP was only slightly active. These PAHs were also tested for mutagenic activity in human cells. In this assay, CPP and CPAA were strongly mutagenic but less active than BaP, whereas CPAP and BF were inactive at the dose levels tested. Also, the bacterial and human cell mutagenicity of CPAA and CPAP were compared with the mutagenicity of their monocyclopenta-fused analogs, aceanthrylene and acephenanthyrlene. Although the mutagenicities of CPAP and acephenanthrylene are similar, the mutagenic activity of CPAA is an order of magnitude greater than that of aceanthyrlene.",

PAH such as benzo[ghi]fluoranthene, benzo[j]fluoranthene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, benzo[a]pyrene, chrysene, dibenzo[a,1]pyrene, fluoranthene and triphenylene showed relatively high genotoxicity. With respect to the nitroarenes, the highest genotoxic potencies were exhibited by the dinitropyrenes. The SOS-inducing potency of nitroarenes increased from the bicyclic to the tetracyclic ring system. Additionally, it was seen that any increase in the extent of nitration is paralleled by an increase of genotoxicity. Whereas PAH required metabolic activation by hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes, nPAH were direct-acting genotoxicants.",

It has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke and mainstream smoke of marijuana cigarettes. Emissions from gasoline/diesel engines and highway vehicles release benzo(ghi)fluoranthene to the environment. Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene occurs in emissions from the combustion of wood, coal, distillate fuel and scrap tires. It occurs in fossil fuels. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.9X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(ghi)fluoranthene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzo(ghi)fluoranthene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.2 hours. Particulate-phase benzo(ghi)fluoranthene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(ghi)fluoranthene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.8X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole and strong adsorption to soil. Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 4 or more rings, such as benzo(ghi)fluoranthene, are generally resistant to biodegradation. If released into water, benzo(ghi)fluoranthene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 and 305 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 2040 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, benzo(ghi)fluoranthene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzo(ghi)fluoranthene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(ghi)fluoranthene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of organic fuels. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(ghi)fluoranthene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

In addition, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate potential volatilization(SRC). Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.9X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2).

Breakdown in soil generally takes weeks to months for PAHs with 3 rings, primarily by action of microorganisms; PAHs with 4 or more rings are generally resistant to biodegradation(4,5). Soil microbes adapted specifically to PAHs are capable of biodegrading benzo(ghi)fluoranthene(6). Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene absorbs light strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.3X10-6 atm-cu m/moleSRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 41 and 305 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 2040(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 5.52(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, benzo(ghi)fluoranthene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(6). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with four or more rings, such as benzo(ghi)fluoranthene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(7). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(8), and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis at water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Vapor-phase benzo(ghi)fluoranthene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase benzo(ghi)fluoranthene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 305 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered(3). Benzo(ghi)fluoranthene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC). In addition, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate potential volatilization(SRC).

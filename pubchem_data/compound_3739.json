When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The gallbladder begins to fill within an hour after injection; maximum filling is reached after two to two and one-half hours.

Biliary excretion rate of iodipamide reached an asymptote with increasing blood concentration, indicating a biliary transport maximum (Tm) of 15.2 to 16.2 mgI/min. Urinary excretion was not a pure, first order process and urinary excretion rate was higher than the glomerular filtration rate corrected for plasma protein binding, suggesting that active tubular secretion may play a part. Extrarenal elimination followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Estimates of maximum rate (Vm) and Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) were obtained graphically. The estimated values of Vm were 4 to 6 times that of biliary Tm. In acute infusion experiments the iodipamide excreted in the bile and urine and that remaining in the organs analyzed accounted for only a fraction of the dose administered; no significant accumulation of iodipamide was found in the liver.",

The relationship between the affinity of the contrast agent for albumin and its preferential uptake and excretion by the liver has been unclear. The role of serum albumin on hepatic uptake and excretion of iodipamide therefore was investigated on the isolated perfused rabbit liver. With the perfusate containing fully reconstituted rabbit plasma protein or 3.5 g/100 mL rabbit albumin alone, the iodipamide excretion is initially extremely slow. It then increases gradually to about 6 mug/gm liver per min by 60 minutes and thereafter remains constant. The half-time of transfer to the bile is about 130 min. Without albumin in the perfusate the initial clearance rate of iodipamide is rapid, with half-time transfer to the bile of about 40 min. Rabbit serum globulins have no effect on iodipamide excretion. Thus, binding of iodipamide to albumin retards the transfer of iodipamide from plasma to the bile, probably due to competition between albumin and the anion binding protein of the liver.",

Employees who are sensitive to natural rubber (latex) should use nitrile or other synthetic nonlatex gloves. Use of powdered latex gloves should be avoided due to the risk of latex allergy.

Approved eye protection (e.g., bearing the ANSI Z87 or CSA stamp) is preferred. Maintain eyewash facilities in the work area.

Lately we experienced such a reaction in an 66-year old female with chronic intrahepatic cholestasis. After drip infusion cholangiography was performed by infusing 40 ml. of 50% meglumine iodipamide (Biligrafin) intravenously, the patient developed nausea and abdominal pain. Her serum transaminase rose to more than 2,000 K-A units on the third day and gradually returned to normal by the 18th day. The macrophage migration inhibition test of her blood was positive for meglumine iodipamide. Accordingly some delayed type of hypersensitivity in the above reaction could be considered. When a larger amount than a recommended dose of meglumine iodipamide is infused in cholangiography, a severe hepatotoxic reaction might be induced, especially in icteric cases.",

Iodipamide administered intraperitoneally or intravenously caused a characteristic type of necrosis which began in the midzonal area and spread to the centrilobular region. Only rats weighing 400 g or more developed necrosis when the dose administered was 2 mmol/kg. Rats weighing 200 g failed to develop liver necrosis even when given 3 mmol/kg. Selenium deficiency and pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene protected against liver necrosis due to iodipamide. Phenobarbital pretreatment provided little or no protection. Kidney tubular necrosis was also observed but occurred in young rats and in selenium-deficient rats which developed no liver necrosis. These results indicate that iodipamide is a hepatotoxin in rats. There are a number of factors, age being the most striking, that modify its hepatotoxicity.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.07X10-24 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates iodipamide will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase iodipamide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Iodipamide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, iodipamide is expected to be immobile based upon the estimated Koc of 1.4X10+4. However, estimated pKa of iodipamide is 1.44, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Iodipamide may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Iodinated X-ray contrast agents are considered nondegradable by microorganisms. If released into water, iodipamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the ionic nature of this compound. The estimated pKa indicates iodipamide will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to iodipamide may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where iodipamide is produced or used. Use data indicate that limited general population exposure to iodipamide will be via administration of pharmaceutical products containing iodipamide. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

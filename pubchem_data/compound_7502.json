For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The reaction of 2-vinylpyridine is carried out at 150 to 200 \u00b0C in an autoclave. After removal of unreacted 2-methylpyridine by distillation, concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to the residue and the resultant mixture is distilled under reduced pressure. During distillation, the dehydration of 2-(2-pyridyl)ethanol occurs to give 2-vinylpyridine as a distillate, which can be purified further by fractional distillation under reduced pressure in the presence of an inhibitor such as 4-tert-butylcatecohol. 4-Vinylpyridine is manufactured by a similar method as that reported for 2-vinylpyridine.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 1.7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 4-vinylpyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 4-vinylpyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 14 and 13 hours, respectively. If released to soil, 4-vinylpyridine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 15. 4-Vinylpyridine has a pKa of 5.62, which indicates that this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in moist acidic soils; cations adsorb more strongly to soils than neutral molecules. Therefore, the mobility of 4-vinylpyridine is expected to be lower in acidic soils than in neutral or alkaline soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, in moist acidic soils, where the protonated form is the dominant species, volatilization will not be important because cations do not volatilize. 4-Vinylpyridine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of 4-vinylpyridine in aerobic soil or water may not be a major fate process based on a single aerobic screening test showing that this compound was not biodegraded over a 4-week period. If released into water, 4-vinylpyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 and 90 days, respectively. In acidic waters where the protonated form is the dominant species, volatilization will not be an important fate process since cations do not volatilize. BCF values from 48 to 96, measured in carp, suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to 4-vinylpyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 4-vinylpyridine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the most common non-occupational exposure is likely to result from either passive or active inhalation of cigarette smoke containing 4-vinylpyridine. (SRC)",

Therefore, the mobility of 4-vinylpyridine is expected to be much lower in acidic soils than in neutral or alkaline soil(SRC). Volatilization of the neutral species of 4-vinylpyridine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a group contribution estimation method(4). However, the protonated form will not volatilize(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 4-vinylpyridine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon an extrapolated vapor pressure of 1.7 mm Hg(5). Biodegradation of 4-vinylpyridine in soil is not expected to be a major fate process based on a single aerobic screening test showing that this compound was not biodegraded over a 4-week period(6).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a group contribution estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 and 90 days, respectively(SRC). The pKa of 4-vinylpyridine is 5.62(7), indicating this compound will partially exist in the ionized form in acidic waters and cations do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), BCF values of 48 to 96 measured in carp(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation of 4-vinylpyridine in water is not expected to be a major fate process based on a single aerobic screening test showing that this compound was not biodegraded over a 4-week period(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

MUTAGENICITIES OF AF & N-OH-AAF WERE INHIBITED BY ANTISERA AGAINST NADPH-CYTOCHROME C REDUCTASE & BY PARAOXON. WHILE MUTAGENIC ACTIVITY OF 2-AAF TO N-HYDROXY-2-AMINOFLUORENE CAN BE PRODUCED BY N-HYDROXYLATION OF 2-AMINOFLUORENE OR DEACETYLATION OF N-HYDROXY-2-ACETYLAMINOFLUORENE, THE DATA SUGGESTED THAT DEACETYLATION OF 2-ACETYLAMINOFLUORENE (TO 2-AMINOFLUORENE), FOLLOWED BY N-HYDROXYLATION TO PRODUCE N-HYDROXY-2-AMINOFLUORENE, WAS MAIN PATHWAY FOR MUTAGENIC ACTIVATION OF 2-ACETYLAMINOFLUORENE BY GUINEA-PIG LIVER (S-9) MIX.",

We proposed that mitochondria are a target for the cytotoxic effects of 2-nitrosofluorene (NOF), a metabolite of 2-acetylaminofluorene, since NOF induces a redox-cycle at complex I and complex III of the respiratory chain, and impairs respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. /It was/ demonstrated that NOF is a potent inducer of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in isolated mitochondria. In the presence of Ca2+, NOF induced rapid swelling of mitochondria in a dose-dependent manner and depolarized the mitochondrial membrane. Permeability transition as well as depolarization were abolished completely by pre-incubation with the PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A. To study whether the PTP is involved in in vivo toxicity, rats were fed a diet containing 2-acetylaminofluorene (0.04%) for 2 weeks. After isolation of mitochondria, permeability transition was induced by high Ca2+ concentrations (150-400 uM) or phosphate plus Ca2+. Swelling was determined as maximal rate of absorption decrease at 540 nm (delta A/delta t). Surprisingly, delta A/delta t-values of mitochondria from 2-acetylaminofluorene-fed rats were significantly lower (16.3 +/- 4.8 x 10(3)/min) than of mitochondria from control animals (32.7 +/- 4.1 x 10(3)/min; P < 0.02). In the presence of phosphate (15 mM), delta A/delta t-values of mitochondria from 2-acetylaminofluorene-fed rats were even lower (10% of control). Moreover, the membrane potential which was dissipated rapidly by the PTP-inducer NOF (30 uM) at a Ca2+ concentration of 80 uM in mitochondria from control animals, remained constant in mitochondria of 2-acetylaminofluorene-treated rats. ... The regulation of the PTP is altered on chronic 2-acetylaminofluorene-feeding. The increased resistance of mitochondria against permeability transition may alter the threshold for apoptosis and thus suppress apoptosis.",

Seal the absorbent paper, and any of your clothes, which may be contaminated, in a vapor-tight plastic bag for eventual disposal. Solvent wash all contaminated surfaces with 60-70% ethanol followed by washing with a soap and water solution. Do not reenter the contaminated area until the Safety Officer (or other responsible person) has verified that the area has been properly cleaned.",

Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and glutathione S-transferase P were used as markers for preneoplastic foci in liver. 2-Acetylaminofluorene (AAF) is a complete rat liver carcinogen, whereas trans-4-acetylaminostilbene (AAS) produces ear duct tumors quite selectively, but also acts as a strong initiator in rat liver. When these carcinogens were administered sequentially as two doses of each or simultaneously as four doses of a mixture to neonate animals, which then were treated with phenobarbital in the drinking water for promotion, the initiating activity was additive. When these chemicals were given to young adult animals within 4 weeks in two series of four doses, followed by partial hepatectomy and phenobarbital in the drinking water, the number of preneoplastic foci was greater in groups which had received AAS in both series or in the second series after AAF than in those groups which had received only AAF or AAF in the second series. The average size of foci depended clearly on the sequence in which the two carcinogens were administered. The foci were larger when AAF was given after AAS. The results support the notion that AAS is a strong initiator in rat liver, and that AAF, which is a complete liver carcinogen, has promoting properties under certain circumstances in addition to its initiating properties. The two carcinogens seem to produce the initiating lesions independently but the extent of initiation is additive in this model situation. The simplified neonatal rat liver model appears to be particularly suitable for investigating initiating properties and is proposed for studies of synergistic effects of genotoxic chemicals on the initiation stage, independent of organotropism. It avoids a number of complicating factors related to treatment schedule, forced proliferation rate and toxicity in other models.",

The incidence of liver tumors is linearly related to the carcinogen concentration in the diet, while the tumor response in the bladder is markedly non-linear. In the current experiments, liver and bladder DNA adducts were measured in female BALB/c mice fed several different concentrations of AAF for 28 days. The adduct concentrations were then compared to the previously reported incidences of neoplastic and preneoplastic lesions in these tissues. In initial experiments, mice were fed either 30 or 150 mg [ring-3H]AAF/kg diet for 21 days. Liver DNA adducts were identified by HPLC, which indicated the presence of one major adduct, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (dG-C8-AF). This adduct was also the major product detected by (32)P-postlabeling in liver and bladder DNA from mice fed the same concentrations of AAF for 28 days. Radioimmunoassays, conducted with an antibody specific for dG-C8-AF, showed that steady-state concentrations of dG-C8-AF were obtained at 28 days of AAF feeding; thus, this time point was used to determine the relationship between the dose of AAF and the adduct levels. In mice fed nine concentrations of AAF (5-150 mg AAF/kg diet), the adduct concentrations after 28 days of feeding were linearly related to dose in both the liver and bladder, with the adduct concentration being approximately 3-fold greater in the bladder. These results indicate that a linear correlation exists between the hepatic concentration of dG-C8-AF and the liver tumor incidence. In the bladder however, a linear relationship was not observed, which suggests that additional tissue-specific factors, such as toxicity, are essential components for tumorigenesis in this tissue.",

Male F344 rats were initially given a single i.p. injection of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200 mg/kg) and starting 2 weeks later received diets containing 2-acetylaminofluorene at dose levels of 150, 100, 60, 45, 35 or 30 p.p.m., 500 p.p.m. phenobarbital (PB) or basal diet as a control for 6 weeks. Two-thirds partial hepatectomy (PH) was performed at week 3. The rats were sequentially killed from weeks 0 to 16 and liver sections were analysed by double staining for both BrdU incorporation and glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) expression. 2-Acetylaminofluorene increased numbers and areas of GST-P positive (GST-P+) foci in a dose-dependent manner, especially after PH. Proliferation of hepatocytes, as indicated by BrdU labelling indices (LI), was higher in GST-P+ foci than in surrounding hepatocytes in all 2-acetylaminofluorene-treated groups, even after cessation of carcinogen administration. Proliferative response of hepatocytes to PH was delayed in rats treated with the highest dose of 2-acetylaminofluorene in both foci and in surrounding areas possibly due to the 2-acetylaminofluorene toxicity. In the PB treated group, the results were similar to those for the lower dose 2-acetylaminofluorene-treated groups. It is concluded that the development of GST-P+ foci and cell proliferation in GST-P+ foci are directly related to 2-acetylaminofluorene treatment in a dose-dependent manner and the present assay system is reliable for detection of carcinogenicity of chemicals even at low doses.",

Three doses over a 10-fold range yielding cumulative total exposures of 0.126, 0.42, and 1.26 mmol AAF/kg body weight were achieved by daily intragastric instillation for up to 12 weeks with interim terminations. This was followed by 24 weeks administration of 500 ppm phenobarbital (PB) in the diet to promote liver tumor development. At 12 weeks at the end of AAF administration, all exposures produced adducts in liver DNA, measured by 32P postlabeling, and the level of adducts increased with exposure, except that the high exposure did not produce a dose proportional increase. Measurement of arylsulfotransferase activity, a key enzyme in the metabolic activation of AAF, revealed that in livers from the high exposure animals, the enzyme was inhibited. To assess for toxicity, the centrilobular zone of glutamine synthetase-positive hepatocytes was quantified immunohistochemically at 12 weeks. The area of the zone was reduced in the high exposure group and there was a trend to reduction in relationship to exposure. The two lower exposures to AAF produced no increase in cell proliferation, whereas the high exposure resulted in a marked increase, about 8-fold over controls. Initiation was assessed by induction of hepatocellular altered foci (HAF) that expressed the placental form of glutathione S-transferase. AAF induced HAF in the high exposure group, 9-fold at 8 weeks and 170-fold at 12 weeks compared to controls. In rats maintained on PB for 24 weeks after exposure, the multiplicity of HAF increased in controls and comparably in the low and mid exposure groups, but remained at the about the same high level in the high exposure group. The high exposure produced a substantial incidence of benign neoplasms by 12 weeks, and with promotion by 36 weeks, all rats developed hepatocellular neoplasia. In the mid exposure group, only one adenoma occurred at 36 weeks in 17 rats, while in the low exposure group, no liver tumor occurred in 23 rats. Thus, these findings document nonlinearities for some of the effects of AAF, with supralinear effects at the high exposure for cell proliferation and induction of HAF, and a no-observed-effect level for induction of promotable liver neoplasms at the lowest cumulative exposure of 0.126 mmol/kg, in spite of the formation of DNA adducts. We conclude that the effects of this DNA-reactive hepatocarcinogen leading to initiation exhibit nonlinearities and possible thresholds.",

Late Xenopus laevis blastulae were exposed to each test material for 96-h in two separate static-renewal tests with and without the presence of five differently induced exogenous metabolic activation systems (MAS). The MAS consisted of Aroclor 1254- (Aroclor 1254 MAS), isoniazid- (INH MAS), phenobarbital- (PB MAS), or beta-naphthoflavone- (beta-NF MAS), or a post-isolation mixture (mixed MAS) of INH-, PB-, and beta-NF-induced rat liver microsomes. Addition of the Aroclor 1254 MAS bioactivated cyclophosphamide, coumarin, 2-AAF, but not TCE. Addition of the PB MAS bioactivated cyclophosphamide, weakly bioactivated coumarin and 2-AAF, but had no effect on TCE developmental toxicity. The beta-NF MAS bioactivated coumarin and 2-AAF, weakly bioactivated cyclophosphamide, but did not alter the developmental toxicity of TCE. Addition of the INH-induced MAS only bioactivated TCE, whereas the post-isolation mixed MAS bioactivated each test material. Based on LC50 and EC50 (malformation) values, embryo growth, and types and severity of induced malformations, each test material was developmentally toxic. Use of post-microsome isolation mixtures from differentially induced rat livers increased the efficacy of the exogenous MAS routinely used by FETAX.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.9X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-acetylaminofluorene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-acetylaminofluorene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours. Particulate-phase 2-acetylaminofluorene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 2-Acetylaminofluorene absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-acetylaminofluorene is expected to have low mobility based upon a log Koc value of 3.14, corresponding to a Koc of 1380. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Acetylaminofluorene may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing activated sludge, 7-12% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 6 days indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, 2-acetylaminofluorene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 53 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2-acetylaminofluorene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-acetylaminofluorene is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

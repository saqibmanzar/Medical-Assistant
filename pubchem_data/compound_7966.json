When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

Commercial liquid-phase hydrogenation of phenol under mild conditions with a palladium on carbon catalyst gives greater than 99% yield of cyclohexanone at 90% conversion. By adjusting the operating conditions and changing to a Raney nickel catalyst, 99.9% selectivity for cyclohexanol can be achieved.",

In the 1950s, Scientific Design (now Halcon International) developed a process in which anhydrous metaboric acid  was added as a slurry to the first of several staged air oxidation vessels. The cyclohexyl hydroperoxide formed is trapped as the cyclohexyl perborate ester. The perborate ester then reacts with additional cyclohexane in the air oxidizer to yield the borate ester and additional cyclohexanol. This borate ester is relatively stable in the air oxidizer and is protected from over oxidation to ring-opened products. The ester is subsequently hydrolyzed to cyclohexanol and boric acid. The boric acid is dehydrated to metaboric acid and is recycled to the air oxidizer.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

This study explored the acute effect of ethanol (EtOH) on the urinary excretion of cyclohexanol (CH-ol), 1,2- and 1,4-cyclohexanediol (CH-diol), biomarkers of exposure to important solvents, and chemical intermediates cyclohexanone (CH-one), cyclohexane (CH) and cyclohexanol. ... Volunteers (5-8 in each group) were exposed for 8 hours either to CH-one, CH or CH-ol vapor at concentrations of about 200, 1000, and (SRP: 2000) mg/cu m, respectively, with concomitant ingestion of EtOH (4 14-g doses taken during the exposure). Urine was collected for 72 hours and analyzed for CH-ol and CH-diols ... . RESULTS: The metabolic yields of CH-ol, 1,2-, and 1,4-CH-diol, respectively, in the exposures with EtOH were as follows: 11.3%, 36%, 23% after the exposure to CH-one, 3.1%, 15%, 8% after the exposure to CH, and 6.6%, 24%, 18% after the exposure to CH-ol. [The corresponding values obtained previously in matching experiments without EtOH were as follows: 1.0%, 39%, 18% (CH-one); 0.5%, 23%, 11% (CH); and 1.1%, 19%, 8% (CH-ol).] The excretion curves of the metabolites in the exposures with EtOH were not delayed when compared with the corresponding curves of a comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: The urinary excretion of CH-diols is much less sensitive to EtOH than that of CH-ol. It is recommended to employ CH-diols as useful and more reliable biomarkers of exposure to CH-one, CH and CH-ol in field examinations.",

This study explored the acute effect of ethanol (EtOH) on the urinary excretion of cyclohexanol (CH-ol), 1,2- and 1,4-cyclohexanediol (CH-diol), biomarkers of exposure to important solvents, and chemical intermediates cyclohexanone (CH-one), cyclohexane (CH) and cyclohexanol. ... Volunteers (5-8 in each group) were exposed for 8 hours either to CH-one, CH or CH-ol vapor at concentrations of about 200, 1000, and 200 mg/cu m, respectively, with concomitant ingestion of EtOH (4 14-g doses taken during the exposure). Urine was collected for 72 hours and analyzed for CH-ol and CH-diols ... . RESULTS: The metabolic yields of CH-ol, 1,2-, and 1,4-CH-diol, respectively, in the exposures with EtOH were as follows: 11.3%, 36%, 23% after the exposure to CH-one, 3.1%, 15%, 8% after the exposure to CH, and 6.6%, 24%, 18% after the exposure to CH-ol. [The corresponding values obtained previously in matching experiments without EtOH were as follows: 1.0%, 39%, 18% (CH-one); 0.5%, 23%, 11% (CH); and 1.1%, 19%, 8% (CH-ol).] The excretion curves of the metabolites in the exposures with EtOH were not delayed when compared with the corresponding curves of a comparison group. CONCLUSIONS: The urinary excretion of CH-diols is much less sensitive to EtOH than that of CH-ol. It is recommended to employ CH-diols as useful and more reliable biomarkers of exposure to CH-one, CH and CH-ol in field examinations.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.657 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyclohexanol will exist solely in the vapor phase in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase cyclohexanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hours. Cyclohexanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cyclohexanol is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 11. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.40X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 96% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. Various aerobic screening studies reported 5-day degradations ranging from 57% to 96% based on theoretical BOD in acclimated sewage inoculums or mixed microbial cultures. If released into water, cyclohexanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8.4 days and 64 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.0 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to cyclohexanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyclohexanol is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to cyclohexanol via inhalation of ambient or indoor air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other consumer products containing cyclohexanol.

Vapor-phase cyclohexanol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 22 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Cyclohexanol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

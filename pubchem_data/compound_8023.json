Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Some patients participating in these studies suffered complications (generalized convulsions due to hypercarbia and respiratory and circulatory depression as well as respiratory and cardiac arrest), which were attributed to overdosage. The degree of muscle relaxation obtained with this type of anesthesia was considered to be inadequate. Liver function tests conducted after several hours of anesthesia showed that hepatic function was not affected. Urinalyses, blood counts and electrocardiograms obtained after anesthesia revealed slight, reversible changes in some cases.",

A satisfactory separation has been made by gas chromatography in a 2 m dimethylsulfolane column followed by a 3 m squalane column on Celite. In this way, 0.5 mL of CH3(14)CH2OCHCH2 of 99.4% chemical purity and 98.3% radiochemical purity has been obtained; the position of the C-14 has been checked by hydrolysis in acid medium. The ether was pyrolyzed in a high vacuum apparatus by the static method. The amounts and specific activities of products were determined in a gas chromatograph connected to a flow ionization chamber with vibrating reed electrometer. Results obtained around 450 \u00b0C seem to prove that vinyl ethyl ether decomposes mainly (78%) by a rearrangement process forming an hexagonal activated complex.",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It was studied as an anesthetic agent in the 1950s. HUMAN STUDIES: Vinyl ethyl ether was studied in clinical trials to investigate whether it was suitable as an anesthetic. Some patients participating in these studies suffered complications (generalized convulsions due to hypercarbia and respiratory and circulatory depression as well as respiratory and cardiac arrest), which were attributed to overdosage. The degree of muscle relaxation obtained with this type of anesthesia was considered to be inadequate. Liver function tests conducted after several hours of anesthesia showed that hepatic function was not affected. Urinalyses, blood counts and electrocardiograms obtained after anesthesia revealed slight, reversible changes in some cases. There is a report of one case of transient damage to the human cornea, which was reversible after 48 hr. ANIMAL STUDIES: In rabbits, it caused only very mild irritation to the skin and eye. On acute oral administration, dermal application and inhalation exposure, vinyl ethyl ether was found to be of low toxicity. A rapid induction of CNS depression and rapid recovery from narcosis was noted with monkeys, dogs, rats. The clinical signs of intoxication were characterized by the CNS depressant effect of the substance. In the Salmonella/microsome assay, vinyl ethyl ether was found to test negative both with and without metabolic activation. In the sister chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, the chemical caused a significant increase in sister chromatid exchange rate.",

The whole cell activity for diethyl ether oxidation was effectively inhibited by 2,3-dihydrofurane, ethyl vinyl ether and glutaraldehyde. Glutaraldehyde of less than 30 uM inhibited the activity by a competitive manner with the inhibition constant, K(I) of 7.07+/-1.36 uM. The inhibition type became mixed at higher glutaraldehyde concentrations >30 uM, probably due to the inactivation of the cell activity by the Schiff-base formation. Structurally analogous ethyl vinyl ether inhibited the diethyl ether oxidation activity in a mixed manner with decreasing the apparent maximum oxidation rate, v(max)(app), and increasing the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, K(M)(app). The mixed type inhibition by ethyl vinyl ether seemed to be introduced not only by the structure similarity with diethyl ether, but also by the reactivity of the vinyl ether with cellular components in the whole cell system.",

In rats, surgically anesthetized with Urethane, an increase in the depth of anesthesia upon administration of ethyl carbamate (Urethane), pentobarbitone sodium (Nembutal), thiopentone sodium (Intraval), althesin, ketamine, trichloroethylene, halothane, methoxyflurane, diethyl ether, ethyl-vinyl ether, cyclopropane, enflurane or chloroform resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the latency, the decrease in the amplitudes of the initial positive and negative components of the short latency cortical response to electrical stimuli applied to the forepaw. 2. The same changes were seen when starting from initially unanesthetized rats and anesthetizing them with Urethane. 3. With all the inhalational agents used, these changes lasted for as long as the administration except with nitrous oxide where the changes in the cortical response were transient. 4. The tranquilizing agents diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and haloperidol showed no such action. Chloral hydrate and chlorpromazine, on the other hand, produced moderate changes in the evoked cortical response similar to those seen with the other anesthetic agents used.",

Male Sprague Dawley-rats were exposed to below anesthetic concentrations of the test agents 7 hours a day for 1 to 7 days, or up to 15 days when nitrous-oxide was used. A single intraperitoneal injection of 125 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) hexobarbital, a sleep inducer, was given 20 to 22 hours after the last exposure to the anesthetic, and sleeping time was determined. Some animals were given an intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg SKF-525-A, an inhibitor of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity, 30 minutes before the hexobarbital injection. Liver homogenates prepared from some rats pretreated with diethyl-ether or halothane were incubated with hexobarbital and assayed for O-demethylase activity and aniline-hydroxylase activity. Hexobarbital sleeping time was significantly reduced after a single 7 hour exposure to diethyl-ether, isopropyl-ether, fluroxene, enflurane, and Forane. Two exposures to halothane and ethyl-vinyl-ether were required to cause a significant reduction in sleeping time. Chloroform caused an increase in sleeping time after one exposure, no change with two or four exposures, and a decrease after five or more exposures. Nitrous-oxide and cyclopropane had no effect on hexobarbital sleeping time. SKF-525-A blocked the decrease in sleeping time caused by diethyl-ether and halothane. The rate of hydroxylation of hexobarbital and aniline by rat liver homogenates was increased by pretreatment with either diethyl-ether or halothane, but demethylase activity was increased only by diethyl-ether pretreatment. The authors conclude that exposure to inhalation anesthetics can enhance the ability of rats to metabolize drugs. ...",

In two of these, large doses up to 110 mL EVE had been used. Urinalysis: no changes were noted in 68% of the patients. Six patients (20%) showed findings (traces of acetone (n=6), increased sugar (n=2), traces of albumin (n=3) which had returned to normal on day 5 post treatment. Blood: no changes in 82% of the patients; the remainder showed slight leucocytosis. ECG: no change in 48% of the patients. Tachycardia, auricular and ventricular premature contractions were all seen. Mild myocardial depression was noted in 5 cases (17%).  Nausea, vomiting: was seen in 10 out of 29 patients. Salivation: was quite severe at times; was treatable with atropine.",

Experiments were carried out to determine the anesthetic effects of divinyl /ether/, ethyl vinyl /ether/ and diethyl ether on mice.  2. The concentrations necessary to produce surgical anesthesia and respiratory arrest were, for divinyl ether 8 and 12 vol. per cent, for ethyl vinyl ether 6 and 16 vol. per cent and for diethyl ether 6 and 18 vol. per cent. Induction time was short and nearly the same for the three ethers in the range 8-14 vol. per cent. Recovery was prolonged following anesthesia with diethyl ether especially when higher concentrations were used. Thus, our results indicate that divinyl ether is the least potent agent for producing surgical anesthesia and the most potent for producing respiratory arrest. It is, therefore, the most dangerous of the three ethers. Ethyl vinyl ether was found to be rapid in action, potent and safe. Recovery time following its use was short.",

Vinyl ethyl ether is released to air in emissions from turbine engines. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 515 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates vinyl ethyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase vinyl ethyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 5, 1.4 and 0.6 hours respectively. Vinyl ethyl ether does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, vinyl ethyl ether is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Vinyl ethyl ether is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Zahn-Wellens test, 100% degradation was reached in 5 days indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, vinyl ethyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.6 hours and 3.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Indirect photolysis may occur in natural waters exposed to sunlight with a half-life of about 25 days. Occupational exposure to vinyl ethyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where vinyl ethyl ether is produced or used. Vinyl ethyl ether was used as an anaesthetic drug for general and thoracic surgery which exposed patients via inhalation. Use of vinyl ethyl ether as an inhaled narcotic in the 1950s has been reported. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.6 hours and 3.4 days, respectively(SRC).

A 100% degradation using activated sludge in the OECD Guideline 302B (Inherent biodegradability: Zahn-Wellens/EMPA) test(5) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).

Vapor-phase vinyl ethyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.79X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Vapor-phase vinyl ethyl ether is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and nitrate radicals(SRC); the half-lives for these reactions in air is estimated to be 1.4 and 0.6 hours(SRC), calculated from respective rate constants of 2.0X10-16 and 1.40X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Vinyl ethyl ether does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Vinyl ethyl ether does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Vinyl ethyl ether is an olefin and olefins react with photooxidants in natural waters (such as hydroxyl, peroxy and singlet oxygen) exposed to sunlight with a half-life on the order of 25 days(5). Vinyl ethyl ether is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

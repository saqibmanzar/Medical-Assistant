Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The estimates of the metabolic parameters are then conditional on the assumed values for all other parameters. Meanwhile, the reliability of other parameters, or the structural model, is usually not questioned. Inhalation exposures with human volunteers in our laboratory show that non-conjugators lack metabolic capacity for methyl chloride entirely, and that elimination in these subjects takes place via exhalation only. Therefore, data from these methyl chloride exposures provide an excellent opportunity to assess the general reliability of standard inhalation PBPK models for humans. A hierarchical population PBPK model for methyl chloride was developed. The model was fit to the experimental data in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. In a Bayesian analysis, it is possible to merge a priori knowledge of the physiological, anatomical and physicochemical parameters with the information embedded in the experimental toxicokinetic data obtained in vivo. The resulting estimates are both statistically and physiologically plausible. Model deviations suggest that a pulmonary sub-compartment may be needed in order to describe the inhalation and exhalation of volatile methyl chloride adequately. The results also indicate that there may be significant intra-individual variability in the model parameters. ...",

The 24 volunteers (13 males and 11 females) who participated in the study were recruited from a group of 208 individuals previously phenotyped for GSTT1 by measuring the glutathione transferase activity with methyl chloride in lysed erythrocytes ex vivo. Eight individuals with high (+/+), eight with medium (+/0) and eight with no (0/0) GSTT1 activity were exposed to methyl chloride gas (10 ppm) in an exposure chamber for 2 hr. Uptake and disposition was studied by measuring the concentration of methyl chloride in inhaled air, exhaled air and blood. A two-compartment model with two elimination pathways corresponding to exhalation and metabolism was fitted to experimental data. The average net respiratory uptake of methyl chloride was 243, 158, and 44 umol in individuals with high, intermediate and no GSTT1 activity, respectively. Metabolic clearance was high (4.6 L/min) in the +/+ group, intermediate (2.4 L/min) in the +/0 group, and close to zero in 0/0 individuals, while the exhalation clearance was similar in the three groups. No exposure related increase in urinary S-methyl cysteine was detected. However, gender and the GSTTl phenotype seemed to affect the background levels. In conclusion, GSTT1 appears to be the sole determinant of methyl chloride metabolism in humans. Thus, individuals with nonfunctional GSTT1 entirely lack the capacity to metabolize methyl chloride.",

The lethal effects of a single 6 hr inhalation exposure of B6C3F1 males to 2500 ppm methyl chloride were completely prevented by pretreatment with the glutathione synthesis inhibitor, L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (4 mmol L-BSO/kg, ip 1.5 hr prior to methyl chloride exposure). ... These results indicate that glutathione is an important component in the toxicity of methyl chloride to multiple organ systems in B6C3F1 mice.

Exposure for 6 hr to 100 ppm methyl chloride decreased the concentration of glutathione in mouse liver by 45%, while exposure to 2500 ppm for 6 hr lowered liver glutathione to approximately 2% of control levels. For those exposures which decreased liver glutathione to less than 20% of control levels, the extent of liver glutathione depletion was closely correlated with the capacity of a 9000 g supernatant fraction from the liver to undergo lipid peroxidation in vitro. Glutathione was depleted to a lesser extent in mouse brain and kidney, compared to liver, and no relationship to peroxidation was observed for single exposures to methyl chloride. ... Exposure of rats to 2000 ppm methyl chloride reduced liver glutathione to 20% of control levels, compared to 4.5% in mice similarly exposed, and under these exposure conditions the amount of lipid peroxidation measured in vitro was 40 fold greater in mouse liver than in rat liver. During exposure of mice to 2500 ppm methyl chloride, ethane expiration increased to an extent comparable to that produced by administration of 2 ml/kg of carbon tetrachloride. These findings suggest that glutathione depletion in liver may be an important component of methyl chloride induced hepatotoxicity.",

Rats were exposed to methyl chloride concentrations of 1500, 500 or 100 ppm. A 6 hr exposure to 1500 ppm methyl chloride decreased the nonprotein SH content of liver, kidney and lungs to 17, 27 and 30% of control values, respectively, while 500 ppm methyl chloride lowered the liver, kidney and lung nonprotein SH to 41, 59 and 55% of control values, respectively, demonstrating a concentration-related effect. Blood nonprotein SH did not differ from controls in either group. No statistically significant changes from controls in tissue or blood nonprotein SH were observed following a 100-ppm methyl chloride exposure. The extent of tissue nonprotein SH loss depended on exposure duration. Liver and kidney nonprotein SH returned to control nonprotein SH concentrations within 8 hr following exposure of 1500 ppm methyl chloride. Pretreatment of rats with Aroclor 1254 or SKF-525A (proadifen hydrochloride) did not alter the methyl chloride-induced decrease in tissue nonprotein SH. Methyl chloride reacted extensively with tissue nonprotein SH in vivo in a concentration-related fashion following acute inhaltion exposure. The most likely nonprotein SH constituent with which methyl chloride reacted was reduced glutathione. The finding that blood nonprotein SH was not affected, in contrast to liver, kidney or lung nonprotein SH, indicated a tissue-specific reaction between methyl chloride and SH groups, a reaction in which the tissue enzyme glutathione-S-alkyltransferase may play a role.",

The usual catalyst is activated aluminum oxide. Excess hydrogen chloride is introduced in order to provide a more favorable equilibrium point (located 96-99% on the side of products at 280-350 \u00b0C) and to reduce the formation of dimethyl ether as a side product (0.2 to 1%). The raw materials must be of high purity in order to prolong catalyst life as much as possible. Technically pure (99.9%) methanol is employed, along with very clean hydrogen chloride. In the event that the latter is obtained from hydrochloric acid, it must be subjected to special purification (stripping) in order to remove interfering chlorinated hydrocarbons.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise.  Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket.",

Most methyl chloride is used as an intermediate feedstock in silicone fluids, elastomers, and resins. Methyl chloride has been used in timber products processing, as a blowing agent for some polystyrene foams, and as a refrigerant. It was formerly used as an aerosol propellant. As a pesticide, methyl chloride is not registered for current use in the U.S.; but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The many symptoms of acute exposure include headache, nausea, irritation of the skin and eyes, central nervous system depression, pulmonary edema, hemolysis, chronic intoxication, paresthesia, narcosis, increased risk of spontaneous abortion, intravascular hemolysis, unconsciousness, rapid followed by slow respiration, painful joints, swelling of the extremities, diabetes, aspiration pneumonia, gross hematuria, reduction of blood pH, gastrointestinal injury, upper respiratory tract irritation, depression, fatigue, vertigo, liver damage, blood dyscrasias, acceleration of the pulse, congestion in the head, neurasthenic disorders, digestive disturbances, acoustical and optical delusions, arrhythmias produced by catecholamines, faintness, loss of appetite, hyporeflexia, gross hemoglobinuria, metabolic acidosis, GI hemorrhage, diverticula, kidney damage, lung damage, corneal injury, abdominal pain, increase in salivary gland tumors, cyanosis, convulsions, coma, and death. Deaths have occurred following single severe or repeated prolonged moderate overexposure. Methyl chloride is poisonous intravenously; moderately toxic by ingestion, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal routes; mildly toxic by inhalation. Most cases of intoxication by methyl chloride have involved concentrations above 500 ppm. After methyl chloride leakage from a refrigerator occurred on board an Icelandic fishing vessel in 1963, many of the crew members were hospitalized due to various neurological symptoms and signs. Follow-up showed increased mortality due to cardiovascular diseases after 47 years. The suicide cases had developed severe depression after the methyl chloride intoxication. Methyl chloride at an atmospheric concentration of 1% (10,000 ppm or 20,700 mg/cu m) was mutagenic to TK6 human lymphoid cells in vitro and caused an increased incidence of sister chromatid exchange and breakage of DNA strands.  ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposure of a rabbit's eye to pure methyl chloride gas at room temperature for ninety seconds caused only slight conjunctival hyperemia. CNS depression occurs at 40,000 ppm in rabbits and at 108,600 ppm in cats. Rats and mice were exposed by inhalation to methyl chloride for 6 hr/day for up to 12 days. All male mice exposed to 2000 ppm were dead or moribund by day 2, and all mice in the remaining 2000 ppm groups were moribund by day 5. The principal clinical signs, which were confined to the 5000 and 3500 ppm groups, included severe diarrhea and incoordination of the forelimbs. In rats, lesions observed in tissues examined included vacuolar degeneration of the zona fasciculata of the adrenal glands and degenerative changes in the seminiferous tubules and epididymis. Three of four dogs and both of two monkeys died after 4 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively, after exposure to 500 ppm for 6 hr/day, 6 days/wk. Mice and rats of both sexes were exposed at methyl chloride concentrations of 0, 50, 225 or 1000 ppm for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 2 years. A statistically significant increase in both malignant and nonmalignant renal tumors occurred in only the male mice exposed at 1000 ppm. In another two-year inhalation study, male and female rats were exposed to 0, 51, 224 or 997 ppm methyl chloride for 6 hr per day, five days per week. No increase in tumor incidence was reported. Birth defects with retarded development have been observed in rodents. Pregnant mice were exposed via inhalation on days 6-18 of gestation. Exposure at 500 or 750 ppm caused a statistically significant increase in the numbers of cardiac malformations. Exposures at concentrations of 250 or 100 ppm were considered  nonteratogenic. Offspring of rats exposed similarly to methyl chloride showed no terata. Methyl chloride is mutagenic to bacteria and induces chromosomal aberrations in plants. It induces DNA damage in mammalian cells in vitro but not in vivo. In cultured mammalian cells, it induces mutations and sister chromatid exchanges and enhances viral cell transformation. Reaction of methyl chloride with glutathione appears to constitute a mechanism of toxication, contrary to the role usually proposed for glutathione in detoxifying xenobiotics.",

Each individual was tested in an environmental room on three tasks involving components of eye-hand coordination, mental alertness, and time discrimination. Both pretreatment and treatment data were obtained. Diazepam produced a significant 10% impairment in task performance, whereas the effect of 200 ppm of MeCl was marginally significant (average performance impairment of 4.5%).

Additionally rats were exposed to 5000 ppm methyl chloride 6 hr/day for 5 days, with and without BW755C treatment as described above. The rats were killed on day 5 and tissues processed for light microscopic examination. Methyl chloride exposed rats showed hepatocellular cloudy swelling, degradation of renal proximal convoluted tubules, vacuolar degeneration in the adrenal cortex, necrosis of the internal granular layer of the cerebellum, and degenerative changes in the testis and epidermis, including formation of epididymal sperm granulomas. With the exception of the adrenal, tissues examined in rats of the methyl chloride/BW755C treatment group showed virtually no histological evidence of lesions. BW755C did not significantly alter metabolism of (14)C methyl chloride to (14)carbon dioxide or (14)carbon in urine, not did it affect the distribution to various organs of radioactivity derived from (14) methyl chloride. Therefore, BW755C protection against methyl chloride toxicity did not appear to result from altered methyl chloride metabolism or disposition. Instead, the protection was apparently related to the pharmacological activity of BW755C as an inhibitor of leukotriene and prostaglandin synthesis.",

Pretreatment of rats with cycloheximide reduced the amt of methyl chloride-derived radioactivity associated with tissue protein by 42-58%, whereas (3H)leucine incorporation was inhibited by 75-85%, indicating that most, but not necessarily all, of the uptake of (14)C-methyl chloride into protein was dependent on normal protein synthesis. Pretreatment with methotrexate inhibited the uptake of (14)C-methyl chloride into lipid, acid-insoluble material, RNA, and DNA by 47, 64, 65, and 93%, respectively. Pretreatment with methanol inhibited (14)C-methyl chloride uptake into acid-insoluble material by 66%. Most of the (14)carbon appearing in macromolecules following inhalation of (14)C-methyl chloride arose through metabolic incorporation, stemming from metabolism of methyl chloride via the 1-C pool. Methanol apparently competed with methyl chloride for entry into this pool, although the failure of ethanol, 4-methylpyrazole, or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to inhibit (14)C-methyl chloride incorporation indicated that methyl chloride was not metabolized to methanol per se. Methanol pretreatment also inhibited (14)CO2 evolution from (14)C-methyl chloride, indicating that metabolism of methyl chloride via 1-C pathways may be of major quantitative significance.",

Behavioral effects of such substances alone and when combined were assessed. Volunteers (84) were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups. Each individual was then tested before and during the treatment or control procedures on three performance tasks. An alcohol dose sufficient to register blood levels of 0.08% produced a significant impairment of 10% on all three tests, which included eye-hand coordination and alertness. A caffeine dose equivalent to two cups of coffee (200 mg) produced a small but significant impairment on only the eye-hand coordination test. Participants who were exposed to methyl chloride for 3.5 hr at levels equivalent to the current legal standard did not experience any significant impairments on the tests. When the solvent was combined with each drug individually, the effect was essentially equivalent to the sum to the separate effects; no behavioral interaction was found.",

Body weight gain was decreased relative to controls for animals dosed at 1500 ppm after 2 weeks exposure and for all F0 animals after day 57. The exposure schedule was then changed to 6 hrs/day, 7 days/week and each male was mated for 2 weeks with 2 females after which 10 males/group were necropsied and the remaining 30 males/group were mated with 2 unexposed females each. Treatment related lesions found in the necropsied high-dose males were severe testicular degeneration and granulomas in the epididymis. Exposure of females was continued after the start of mating to gestation day 18 (6 hrs/day, 7 days/week) and exposure resumed at the same concentrations from postnatal day 4-28. There were no significant differences between groups in the number of females that mated, but no litters were born to exposed or unexposed females mated to high-dose males, and significantly fewer litters were born to mid-dose females. No differences in the following were observed in litters born to mid- and low-dose and control animals: litter size, sex ratio, pup viability or pup growth. Ten weeks after exposure ceased, 5 of 20 F0 males had regained the ability to sire normal litters versus 15 of 20 of F0 mid-dose and control males. A trend towards decreased fertility was observed in F1 pups from the mid-dose group relative to low-dose and control group F1 pups exposed to the same concentrations of methyl chloride for 10 weeks and then mated.",

Females were sacrificed at this time and 22 females were pregnant in the 0 ppm group, 23 at 100 ppm, 20 at 500 ppm, and 21 at 1500 ppm. Maternal food consumption and body weight were significantly depressed in dams exposed to 1500 ppm on GD 15 and 20. Weight gain was depressed in dams at 500 or 1500 ppm on gd 7-15, and the weight at sacrifice was significantly depressed for the 1500 ppm group. No other maternal or reproductive parameters were affected in any of the exposure groups. A significant reduction relative to controls in fetal male and female body weights and female crown-rump length were indicative of fetal toxicity. There were no methyl chloride-induced external, skeletal, or visceral abnormalities observed in the 50% of the fetuses from each litter examined for defects. In the fetal skeletal preparations from the 1500 ppm exposure group, statistically significant retardation in ossification was observed in the metacarpals and phalanges of the anterior limbs, thoracic vertebral centra, sternebrae, pubes of the pelvic girdle, and metatarsal of the hind limbs.",

Females in the 1500 ppm group exhibited urogenital bleeding commencing the 4th day of exposure (GD 10) and exhibited tremors, difficulty righting after falling over in their cages during exposure and a pronounced hunched-back and disheveled appearance, each of which worsened as exposures progressed. Exposure to the entire 1500 ppm group was terminated on GD 10-14, the dams were sacrificed, and 15 females of this group were pregnant. Selective necrosis of neurons in the internal granule cell layer of the cerebellum was observed in all high-dose females. Females from all other groups were sacrificed on GD 18 and 24 were pregnant in the 0 ppm group, 20 at 100 ppm, and 17 at 500 ppm.

Live male fetuses exhibited an increase in crown-rump length relative to controls. A small, but statistically significant increase in incidence of heart defects was observed in the litters of the 500 ppm group which consisted of a reduction or absence of the atrioventricular valve, chordae tendineae and papillary muscle on either the left or right side of the fetal hearts. Ossification in fetuses from exposed groups was equivalent to, or accelerated, relative to controls with acceleration of ossification in the tarsal and metatarsals of the hind limbs in fetuses from the 100 and 500 ppm groups which also exhibited more caudal centra per fetus versus controls.",

It is estimated that up to 99% of methyl chloride released to the environment is from natural sources, such as the oceans or from combustion of grass, wood, charcoal, and coal. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4,300 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl chloride will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Gas-phase methyl chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 445 days. Methyl chloride does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methyl chloride is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 13. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.82X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl chloride is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 1% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks, indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. However, a 77% biodegradation in 28 days using OECD Guideline 301D suggests methyl chloride can biodegrade readily under certain conditions. Overall, methyl chloride is not considered readily biodegradable, but it can be degraded by adapted bacteria and under anaerobic conditions. If released into water, methyl chloride is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Methyl chloride has been shown to biodegrade in environmental waters. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.1 hours and 2.8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The hydrolysis half-life is 0.93 yr at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to methyl chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl chloride is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methyl chloride via inhalation of ambient air and tobacco smoke, ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with seawater containing methyl chloride.

Major sources of release of methyl chloride to the air include tropical plants, wood-rotting fungi, and soil from wood-rotting fungi(1). It is estimated that up to 99% of methyl chloride released to the environment is from natural sources, such as chemical reactions that occur in the oceans or chemical reactions that occur from combustion of grass, wood, charcoal, and coal(1,2). Millions of kilograms of methyl chloride are produced naturally every day, primarily in the oceans(3). Methyl chloride is produced in seawater by the reaction of methyl iodide, which is produced photosynthetically by several marine organisms, with chloride ions(4). For the eastern Pacific, the mean ocean air flux of 13X10-7 g/sq cm-yr when extrapolated to global waters provide an adequate source to explain the atmospheric reservoir of methyl chloride(5). Methyl chloride is released to the atmosphere from forest fires, brush fires, back yard burning and volcanoes(6-8). Agricultural slash burning is believed to be a source of high levels of methyl chloride in the Amazon and China, the latter specifically from rice agriculture(9). The estimated 0.6 g of methyl chloride per kg vegetation burned is believed to have an impact on the global burden of methyl chloride(6). Plant volatiles from cedar and cypress include methyl chloride(10). Methyl chloride has been identified as a chemical component of tobacco plants(11). Various species of Antarctic macroalgae have been found to produce and release methyl chloride at levels of 1.98 pmol/g (wet wt) per day(2).",

Methyl chloride is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 4300 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 1% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(5) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). However, a 77% biodegradation in 28 days using OECD Guideline 301D(6) suggests methyl chloride can biodegrade readily under certain conditions. Methyl chloride has been shown to biodegrade in soil microcosms(8) and in environmental waters(6,7). Overall, methyl chloride is not considered readily biodegradable, but it can be degraded by adapted bacteria and under anaerobic conditions(7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.82X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.1 hours and 2.8 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.91(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 1% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks(5) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). However, a 77% biodegradation in 28 days using OECD Guideline 301D(8) suggests methyl chloride can biodegrade readily under certain conditions. Methyl chloride has been shown to biodegrade in environmental waters(8,9). Overall, methyl chloride is not considered readily biodegradable, but it can be degraded by adapted bacteria and under anaerobic conditions(9). The half-life for the hydrolysis of methyl chloride is 0.93 yr at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(10); the rate is independent of pH below pH 10(10).",

Gas-phase methyl chloride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 445 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.6X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Methyl chloride does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere(SRC). The dominant loss mechanism for methyl chloride in the troposphere may be upward diffusion although washout by rain may have some importance(5). From the tropopause to about 30 km, both upward diffusion and reaction with hydroxyl radicals may have approximately equal importance, and above 30 km in the stratosphere diffusion, reaction with hydroxyl radicals, and direct photolysis may have approximately equal weight(5). The surface half-life resulting from upward diffusion is about 80 days(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Samples of an alluvial aquifer collected beneath Denver CO in 1993 had positive methyl chloride detections in about 7% of all samples with a maximum level of 0.6 ug/L(3). Methyl chloride was detected in 4% of 214 groundwater samples collected in industrial areas of Taiwan between 1994-1994(4). A US Geological Survey analysis for VOCs in drinking water from domestic wells sampled during 1985-2002 detected methyl chloride in 117 of 1207 total well samples(5). As part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program of the USGS, groundwater samples collected from 2948 wells between 1985 and 1995 were analyzed for VOCs(6); methyl chloride was detected in 1.1% of urban wells at levels of 0.2-0.8 ug/L(6); methyl chloride was detected in 0.4% of rural wells at levels of 0.2-20 ug/L(6). Monitoring wells sampled between 1996-1998 in southern New Jersey (95 total wells) had about 14% positive methyl chloride detections (0.254 ug/L method reporting level)(7).",

Methyl chloride was detected in 1 of 5 leachates from municipal waste landfills in Wisconsin at 170 ppb and detected, not quantified in 4 of 6 leachates from municipal landfills in Minnesota(2). Methyl chloride has been detected in treated wastewater from the following industries (industry (mean concentration)): pharmaceutical manufacturing (2000 ppb), organic chemical manufacturing/plastics (0.1 ppb), timber products processing (140 ppb) and raw wastewater from metal finishing (610 ppb)(3). Ratios of methyl chloride (ppmv) to carbon dioxide (1X10-6 ppmv) in wood smoke ranged from 0.66 to 2.63(4). In a comprehensive survey of wastewater from 4000 industrial and publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) sponsored by the Effluent Guidelines Div of the US EPA, methyl chloride was identified in discharges of the following industrial categories (frequency of occurrence, median concentration in ppb): nonferrous metals (1; 21.6), paint and ink (2; 4128.7), printing and publishing (1; 6.0), organics and plastics (1; 156.7), pharmaceuticals (1; 2558.3), organic chemicals (3; 49.0)(5); the highest effluent concentration was 4194 ppb in the paint and ink industry(5). Methyl chloride has been detected in anhydrous volcanic gases from various locations at levels ranging from 0.61 to 84 ppbv(6).

Monitoring at four US sites (191 samples) detected methyl chloride at 590-1300 parts per trillion with a 1300 parts per trillion median(2). Sampling at 8 background locations in 1980 (time series over seasons) detected 564-687 parts per trillion methyl chloride(3); concentration highest in spring and lowest in fall and highest in the tropics; however there is no significant difference between hemispheres(3). Two rural coastal sites (192 samples) near San Francisco had 953 parts per trillion(4). Mean concentration of methyl chloride over the eastern Pacific between 40 deg N and 32 deg S latitudes was 630 parts per trillion, and contrary to other results, the methyl chloride concentration was independent of latitude(5). The concentration of methyl chloride decreases with altitude, declining to 50 parts per trillion at 29 km(6). The island of Terschelling, The Netherlands (least populated area of country) had a mean concentration of 700 parts per trillion(7). From the coast to the forest in Guyana had methyl chloride concentrations of 630-730 parts per trillion volume(8). The atmospheric background level of methyl chloride is reported to be around 1.2 ug/cu m (0.6 ppb)(9). Air samples collected over the western Pacific Ocean region in 1991 and 1994 contained median methyl chloride concentrations ranging from 464 to 594 parts per trillion(10). The average atmospheric global concentration of methyl chloride between 1985 and 1996 ranged from 573 to 612 parts per trillion volume depending on latitude(11). Air sampling at a remote island (Okinawa, Japan) in 1996 detected levels of 574-766 parts per trillion volume(12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This section also includes information on whether the chemical is considered as a potential carcinogen according to authoritative sources such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens and the International agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 1.25X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diisopropanolamine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase diisopropanolamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. If released to soil, diisopropanolamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10; however, the pKa of diisopropanolamine is 9.1, indicating that this compound will exist in the protonated form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly than neutral species. Diisopropanolamine adsorbs strongly to clay minerals, and hence its mobility in surface soils and the subsurface is dependent on the mineralogy in the soil and aquifer. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because cations do not volatilize. Diisopropanolamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its extrapolated vapor pressure. Screening studies using sewage sludge indicated that diisopropanolamine does not biodegrade readily. If released into water, diisopropanolamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces will not be an important fate process since this compound is expected to exist in the protonated form in water surfaces. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to diisopropanolamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diisopropanolamine is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to diisopropanolamine dermally through the use of cosmetic products containing this compound. (SRC)",

A pKa value of 9.1(4) indicates that the protonated form of diisopropanolamine will be the dominant species in moist soil surfaces and cations adsorb more strongly than neutral species. Batch adsorption experiments indicated that the adsorption mechanism of diisopropanolamine involves ionic interaction at cation exchange sites of soils and clays, and tends to be greatest in materials that have a large cation exchange capacity such as montmorillonite(5). Volatilization of diisopropanolamine from moist soil surfaces will not be an important fate process since cations do not volatilize. Diisopropanolamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its extrapolated vapor pressure of 1.25X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). Screening studies using sewage sludge indicated that diisopropanolamine does not biodegrade readily(4,7).",

A pKa value of 9.1(4) indicates that the protonated form of diisopropanolamine will be the predominant species in water and cations adsorb more strongly to suspended solids and sediment than neutral species. Volatilization from water surfaces will not occur since cations do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Screening studies using sewage sludge indicated that diisopropanolamine does not biodegrade readily(4,7).",

Vapor-phase diisopropanolamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours(SRC), from its rate constant of 1X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C, that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Diisopropanolamine is not expected to directly photolyze due to the lack of absorption in the environmental UV spectrum(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The adsorption isotherms were non-linear with Freundlich adsorption (Kf) coefficients ranging from 3.5 to 170, with the greatest values observed in the montmorillonite clay materials(1). Since diisopropanolamine has a pKa value of 9.1(1,2) it exists primarily as a cation in solution and a strong correlation between adsorption and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the material tested was observed(1). It was also noted that adsorption decreased with increasing solution electrolyte concentration as this resulted in competition for cation exchange sites in the clays and soils(1). Adsorption also decreased with increasing pH since at higher pH, a smaller percentage of diisopropanolamine exists in the protonated form.",

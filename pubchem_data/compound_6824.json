PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

In 1927, responsibility of the Food and Drugs Act was transferred to FDA. Increasing government oversight, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) was passed in 1938 and established the three following categories for colors: FD&C: colors used in foods, drugs and cosmetics; D&C: colors used in drugs and cosmetics when in contact with mucous membranes or ingested; and Ext.

Food Yellow 10's production and use as a biological stain may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.5X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates C.I. Food Yellow 10 will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase C.I. Food Yellow 10 will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 hours. Particulate-phase C.I. Food Yellow 10 will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. C.I. Food Yellow 10 contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, C.I. Food Yellow 10 is expected to have be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 6.6X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.1X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, C.I. Food Yellow 10 is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Azo dyes are hydrophobic compounds, suggesting they will partition strongly to bottom sediments where reductive cleavage of the azo linkage may occur. This transformation process could result in the release of potentially hazardous aromatic amines to the water column. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to C.I. Food Yellow 10 may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where C.I. Food Yellow 10 is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may have been exposed to C.I. Food Yellow 10 via ingestion and dermal contact with consumer products containing C.I. Food Yellow 10, which are no longer approved uses. (SRC)",

Food Yellow 10 is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment(SRC). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.1Z10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 10(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 4.77(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC,2011). However, azo dyes are hydrophobic compounds, suggesting they will partition strongly to bottom sediments where reductive cleavage of the azo linkage may occur. This transformation process could result in the release of potentially hazardous aromatic amines to the water column(8), in this case, aniline and 1,2 naphthylamine(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

After either exposure, solvent yellow was rapidly cleared from the respiratory tract, with a t1/2 of 2-3 hr. Solvent green was retained in the lungs with a minimum estimated t1/2 for clearance of 22 days. Solvent green was not detected in other tissues during the 70-hr post-exposure period. After either exposure, high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis of tissues extracts indicated that 40 to 75% of the (14)C in liver and kidney consisted of solvent yellow metabolites. Greater than 90% of the (14)C in the lungs was unmetabolized solvent yellow. The major pathway for excretion of solvent yellow and solvent yellow metabolites was the feces (74% of the initial body burden) ... Urinary (14)C accounted for 14% of the initial body burden ... Over 90% of the (14)C excreted in the urine was solvent yellow metabolites. Very little solvent yellow (2%) was metabolized to (14)CO2.

For rats given (14)C-DCY in the feed (0.00044-0.41% of the diet), recovery of radioactivity during the 24-hr dosing period and the 72-hr period thereafter ranged from 89.1 to 93.9% for feces and from 4.98 to 6.25 for urine. Tissues contained only trace amounts. Following intravenous dosing with (14)C-DCY (0.93 mg/kg), radioactivity distributed readily into most tissues; maximum amounts were present at 5 min, the earliest time of assay. Maximum amounts of radioactivity in fat, skin, and gut tissue, however, were present at 30 min after dosing. These three tissues also had relatively long alpha phases for the elimination of radioactivity. In 24 hr after intravenous dosing, rats excreted 81.1% of the dose in the feces and 16.0% of the dose in the urine. For rats fitted with biliary cannulas, 54.5% of the dose, all of which was metabolites of (14)C-DCY, was recovered in the bile in 4 hr. Associated with the rapid and extensive biliary excretion of metabolites of intravenously administered (14)C-DCY was the appearance of large amounts of radioactivity in the feces and also, at intermediate time points, in the liver, gut contents, and gut tissue. In conclusion, rats rapidly distribute, metabolize, and excrete (14)C-DCY.",

Purified D&C Yellow no. 10, which was found to consist of 6 derivatives of sodium sulfonated quinophthalone, did not sensitize or elicit a cross-reaction in quinophthalone-sensitized guinea pigs even at a challenge concentration of 5%. Commercial D&C Yellow no. 10 contained 0.95-170 ppm of quinophthalone, and it is suggested that skin sensitization by D&C Yellow no. 10 is caused by contaminating quinophthalone.",

The animals were treated once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (induction phase), rested for 2 weeks, and challenged with another 24-hr occluded patch containing 1, 3, or 10 percent Solvent Yellow 33 in 95 percent ethanol, Twenty-four hours after the patches were removed, the treated areas were depilated and evaluated on a scale of 0 to 4 for erythema and edema. The lowest score of 0 indicates no reaction, and the highest score of 4 indicates strong erythema (beet red), with or without edema, eschar formation, or skin damage. Control animals were treated with 95 percent ethanol. /Investigators/ noted that the induction dose of Solvent Yellow 33 was minimally irritating. The skin sensitization reaction elicited by the challenge was statistically significant only for the 10 percent concentration; 11 of 13 animals (85 percent) responded with a score of 1 (barely perceptible erythema). Only 15 to 20 percent of the controls responded with a score of 1. Thus, Solvent Yellow 33, under the conditions of the rest, was a weak sensitizer.",

These exposure concentrations resulted in average daily doses of approximately 25, 85, or 250 mg D&C Yellow No.11/kg body weight to males and 25, 100, or 280 mg/kg to females. Survival of males given 1,700 or 5,000 ppm was significantly less than that of the controls, and survival of 1,700 ppm females was significantly greater than that of the controls. Mean body weights of 1,700 and 5,000 ppm males and females were generally lower than those of the controls throughout the study. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls. Chemical-related clinical findings included yellow discoloration of the entire body in all exposed males and females from day 1 and head swelling and edema in 1,700 and 5,000 ppm males. One 1,700 ppm and five 5,000 ppm males were moribund and were killed between weeks 49 and 81; these deaths were attributed to extensive edema. A few minimal hematology changes occurred in male rats at the 12-month interim evaluation. There was evidence of minimal anemia in exposed males; this anemia was characterized by decreased hematocrit values, hemoglobin concentrations, and erythrocyte counts. The minimal anemia was characterized as normocytic, normochromic, and nonresponsive. There were no biologically or statistically significant differences in hematology parameters between control and exposed females. Absolute and relative liver weights of all exposed groups of males and females were significantly greater than those of the controls at 12 months. At 2 years, the incidences of hepatocellular adenoma in 5,000 ppm males and of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 5,000 ppm females were significantly greater than those in the controls. At 12 months, the incidences of clear cell foci in 1,700 and 5,000 ppm females were significantly greater than that in the controls. At 2 years, the incidences of mixed cell foci in exposed males and of clear cell foci in exposed males (except 500 ppm) and females were significantly greater than those in the controls. Incidences of cytologic alterations (basophilia and granularity) of hepatocytes, and pigmentation in bile duct epithelium, hepatocytes, and Kupffer cells in exposed males and females were greater than those in the controls at both 12 months and 2 years. Renal tubule adenomas were observed in two 5,000 ppm males, and one renal tubule carcinoma was observed in a 1,700 ppm male. During an extended evaluation, renal tubule adenomas were observed in two additional 5,000 ppm males, four 1,700 ppm males, and two 500 ppm males. Renal tubule hyperplasia was observed in exposed groups of males but not in controls, and the incidences in 1,700 ppm males from both standard and extended evaluations were significantly greater than those in the controls. Necrosis and regeneration of the renal tubule epithelium were observed in all control and exposed male rats and in most female rats at 12 months and 2 years. The severity of nephropathy in exposed males and females was significantly greater than that in the controls. In exposed males and 1,700 ppm females at 2 years, the incidences of hyperplasia of the transitional epithelium in the kidney, which commonly accompanies advanced nephropathy, were greater than those of the controls, and the severity of this lesion in exposed males and females was greater than that in the controls. The incidences of renal tubule pigmentation in all exposed groups of males and females at 12 months and 2 years were significantly greater than those in the controls. Squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue were observed in one 500 ppm male at 12 months and one 5,000 ppm female at 2 years, and one squamous cell carcinoma of the oral mucosa was observed in each group of exposed males and in one 5,000 ppm female at 2 years. At 2 years, squamous cell papillomas were observed in the oral cavity (oral mucosa or tongue) of one control, one 500 ppm, two 1,700 ppm, and four 5,000 ppm males; this lesion was also observed in one control and 500 ppm female."

Its use as a smoke colorant will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.7X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates D&C Yellow No. 11 will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase D&C Yellow No. 11 will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. D&C Yellow No. 11 contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, D&C Yellow No. 11 is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3800. The estimated pKa of D&C Yellow No. 11 is 5.28, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. D&C Yellow No. 11 may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, D&C Yellow No. 11 is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. The estimated pKa indicates D&C Yellow No. 11 will exist partially in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 61 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to D&C Yellow No. 11 may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where D&C Yellow No. 11 is produced or used.

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

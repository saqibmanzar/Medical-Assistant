If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This municipal water system serves nearly 300,000 people whose water was affected by the chemical spill. Due to the uncertainty over the chemical levels in the water supply, the Office of the Governor issued a \"Do Not Use\" order at 6:00 pm on January 9, 2014. Later that evening, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources contacted CDC about the release and requested assistance to review water sampling data and provide a drinking water screening level for MCHM. On January 21, 2014, the manufacturer reported that another material was part of the chemical release that occurred on January 9, 2014. This material has been identified as a proprietary mixture primarily composed of propylene glycol phenyl ether (PPH) and dipropylene glycol phenyl ether (DiPPH). It was in the same tank and entered the water system at the same time as the MCHM. This mixture represented a relatively small percentage (approximately 7.3% by weight) of the total amount in the tank.",

Animals were weighed and had detailed clinical observations recorded on Days 0, 4, 7, 14, 18, 22, and 29. Feed intake was assessed twice/week. At termination hematology (Hb conc., Hct, RBC count and morphology, WBC count and diff., and plt. Count) and clinical chemistries (AST, ALT, SDH, ALK, Creat., BUN, and gluc.) were conducted. At termination, animals underwent a gross examination with the following organs weighed: liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, testes, and thymus. Organs examined by histology included: trachea, lungs, heart, esophagus, stomach, small & large intestine, pancreas, liver, salivary glands, kidney, urinary bladder, pituitary, adrenals, thyroids, parathyroids, thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, bone marrow, brain, testes, epididymis, accessory sex organs in males, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina and ovaries. NOAEL (NOEL): 1.0%; [871 mg/kg (males) and 894 mg/kg (females)]. There were no mortalities or clinical signs related to exposure. There were no differences in body weights, feed consumption, hematology, clinical chemistries, and organ weights compared to controls. There were no gross or histological changes observed. CHDA induced essentially no toxicity following 4 weeks of exposure at a high exposure rate (1% of diet)."

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 4.41X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 31. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.7X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces may not be an important fate process based upon its vapor pressure. Results of several biodegradation tests indicate that dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate is inherently biodegradable and that biodegradation may be an important fate process in the soil and water environments. If released into water, dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis in acidic and neutral conditions is too slow to be of environmental importance (estimated half-lives on the order of years); hydrolysis half-life in very alkaline media of pH 9 is on the order of one month at 25 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate is produced or used. Limited population exposure may occur via ingestion of and dermal contact with contaminated water in the vicinity of a spill site. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase dimethyl hexahydroterephthalate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.9X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

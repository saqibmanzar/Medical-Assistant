For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996.

Volatilization to the atmosphere and biodegradation are not expected to be important and 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid may persist in soil for long periods of time.

Adsorption to sediment will be influenced by pH and organic carbon and clay content as well as hydrophobic factors. If released to the atmosphere, 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid will exist predominately as a particulate and is susceptible to both wet and dry deposition processes. Photolysis is not expected to be an important atmospheric removal process. Exposure to the general population may occur by ingestion of contaminated drinking water.

Biodegradation studies with soil inoculum and added nutrients produced an enhanced removal rate(1) suggesting that cometabolic process may be important(2). Adsorption of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid to sediment may be important based on estimated soil adsorption coefficients ranging from 237 to 1311(3) determined from its water solubility, 200 mg/L(4), and octanol/water partition coefficient, 3.20(5). Laboratory studies have indicated rapid adsorption to sediment(1) although pH, percent organic matter, and clay content of sediment may also be important in determining the degree of adsorption due to 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid's high degress of ionization at environmental pHs(6-7).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Cometabolic degradation may be the major biodegradation process for 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid in aquatic systems(2). A dichlorohydroxybenzene derivative was tentatively identified as a product of the biodegradation of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid in soil(2). 2,3,6-Trichlorophenylacetic acid was described as being susceptible to decarboxylation reactions when incubated with soil inoculum(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Soil pH, especially in the range 5.0-6.7, was described as the most important factor in 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid mobility(2-3). At neutral or basic pHs, 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid will exist predominately as the ionized acid and adsorption to soil will driven by ionic interactions between it and the soil while at more acidic pHs hydrophobic processes will predominate(4). Soil TLC experiments using a wide range of soils (Hagerstown silty clay loam, Lakeland sandy loam, Chillium silt loam) produced Rfs ranging from 0.38 to 1.0 indicating that 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid has a high degree of mobility compared to other pesticides(2-6).",

According to a suggested classification scheme(4), these values suggest that 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid will display moderate to high mobility in soil. A Koc of 170 has been estimated for 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid based on its heat of solution(5).

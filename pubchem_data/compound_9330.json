When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Due to the likelihood of various scenarios of military or terrorist attacks by these and other chemical weapons, research has to be aimed at finding optimal therapies. Early accumulation of acetylcholine in synaptic clefts was suggested to trigger an array of toxic events including an excessive release of glutamate, culminating in the activation of its receptors. Stimulation of the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) subtype of these receptors was associated with the neuronal injury that initiates organophosphate-induced brain damage. The notion of a stepwise mechanism yielded treatments based on a combination of an immediate administration of enzyme reactivators and anticholinergic drugs. This strategy dramatically increased survival rates but did not abolish convulsions and failed to prevent the ensuing cognitive dysfunction. Efforts to improve this paradigm by adding anticonvulsants or antiglutamatergic drugs with anti-epileptic characteristics produced dubious results. Under these conditions, benactyzine and caramiphen, agents with anticholinergic and antiglutamatergic properties, provided improved protection when introduced as adjunct agents to oximes, reversible cholinesterase inhibitors and/or specific antimuscarinic drugs such as atropine. In contrast, the specific antimuscarinic drug scopolamine failed to block soman-induced changes in glutamatergic and behavioral parameters even when given prophylactically. These findings along with a large number of additional reports led towards the conclusion that the therapeutic advantage of drugs such as benactyzine and caramiphen could derive from their ability to modulate central cholinergic and glutamate neurotransmission.",

The efficacy of choice antidotal treatment consisting of acetylcholinesterase reactivator obidoxime and one of four anticholinergic drugs (atropine, benactyzine, biperiden, scopolamine) was compared. Testing of tabun-induced neurotoxicity progress was carried out using the method Functional observational battery. The experimental animals as well as controls were observed at 24 hours and 7 days following tabun or saline administration. The results were compared to the condition of animals without anticholinergic drug (oxime alone) and control rats that received physiological solution instead of tabun and treatment. Antidotal treatment involving centrally acting anticholinergic drugs (benactyzine, biperiden, scopolamine) showed significantly higher neuroprotective efficacy compared to antidotal treatment containing atropine.",

Soman at sublethal dose also significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in diaphragm and various brain parts. 3 Panpal pretreatment as well as antidotal treatment were effective in improving the respiratory and circulatory function disturbed by soman without the ability to increase significantly soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in all brain parts studied. 4 The efficacy of combined Panpal pretreatment and antidotal treatment against sublethal soman poisoning was not different from the efficacy of Panpal pretreatment or antidotal treatment alone. 5 The results of this investigation suggest that Panpal pretreatment as well as antidotal treatment are able to restore respiratory and circulatory function in soman-poisoned rats without significant reactivation of brain acetylcholinesterase.",

We report here on the protection provided by post-exposure antidotal treatments against a lethal dose of sarin (1.2xLD50) by scopolamine, benactyzine, trihexyphenidyl or caramiphen, administered 5, 10 or 20 min after the initiation of convulsions. A mixture of the oxime TMB4 and atropine (TA) was injected 1 min following poisoning a paradigm that may represent a scenario reminiscent of a terror incident. Surviving TA-treated rats exhibited marked tonic-clonic convulsions, weight loss, poor clinical status and abnormal cognitive performance as assessed by the Morris water maze. Additionally, a dramatic increase in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs), a faithful marker for neuronal damage, was noted. Animals treated 5 min after the development of toxic signs with benactyzine, trihexyphenidyl or caramiphen demonstrated control levels of PBR values, whereas scopolamine produced binding densities significantly above basal levels. Examined at the 10-min time point, scopolamine and trihexyphenidyl afforded no protection against brain damage and did not differ from TA-injected rats. All four drugs failed to significantly prevent the alterations when applied 20 min after onset of convulsions. Assessment of learning processes yielded similar results, where caramiphen exibited some protection at the 20-min time point. Our results show that caramiphen and benactyzine, agents with combined anticholinergic and antiglutamatergic pharmacological profiles, offer considerable shielding against sarin, even when their administration is delayed.   8",

As an anticholinergic drug it could also be expected to produce vision changes by its action on the intraocular musculature controlling the pupil and lens accommodation. ... The drug /was tested/ on six volunteer subjects to establish the visual side-effects of intramuscular administration. ... It reduced static and dynamic visual acuity, increased pupil size, reduced amplitude of accommodation and contrast sensitivity, while having little or no effect on glare recovery, color vision, intraocular pressure, stereoacuity, oculomotor tracking, and distance heterophoria. Benactyzine produced reductions in visual performance for up to 3 hr and had the greatest effects on functions which have significant cognitive components. ...",

A single dose of the drug (4.14 mg/70 kg body weight, which is within the therapeutic range) and placebo were administered intramuscularly to 12 subjects. Large and significant decrements in visual function were demonstrated after the administration of benactyzine, particularly for those functions performed at near focus.

The drug increased pulse rate and blood pressure, and induced an intoxicated state involving loss of concentration, attention, and short-term memory. /Benactyzine hydrochloride/",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The interaction of aprophen and benactyzine, both aromatic esters of diethylaminoethanol, with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in BC3H-1 intact muscle cells and with receptor-enriched membranes of Torpedo californica /was examined/. Aprophen and benactyzine diminish the maximal carbamylcholine-elicited sodium influx into muscle cells without shifting Kact (carbamylcholine concentration eliciting 50% of the maximal 22Na+ influx). The concentration dependence for the inhibition of the initial rate of 22Na+ influx by aprophen and benactyzine occurs at lower concentrations (Kant = 3 and 50 microM, respectively) than those needed to inhibit the initial rate of [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding to the agonist/antagonist sites of the AChR (Kp = 83 and 800 uM, respectively). The effective concentration for atropine inhibition of AChR response (Kant = 150 microM in BC3H-1 cells) is significantly higher than those obtained for aprophen and benactyzine. Both aprophen and benactyzine interact with the AChR in its desensitized state in BC3H-1 cells without further enhancing agonist affinity. Furthermore, these ligands do not alter the value of Kdes (equilibrium concentration of agonist which diminishes 50% of the maximal receptor response) in BC3H-1 muscle cells. The affinity of aprophen and benactyzine for the allosterically coupled noncompetitive inhibitor site of the AChR in Torpedo was determined using [3H]phencyclidine as a probe. Both compounds were found to preferentially associate with the high affinity (desensitized) state rather than the resting state of Torpedo AChR. There is a 14- to 23-fold increase in the affinity of aprophen and benactyzine for the AChR (KD = 0.7 and 28.0 uM in the desensitized state compared to 16.4 and 384 uM in the resting state, respectively). These data indicate that aprophen and benactyzine binding are allosterically regulated by the agonist sites of Torpedo AChR. Thus, aprophen and benactyzine are effective noncompetitive inhibitors of the AChR at concentrations of 1-50 uM, in either Torpedo or mammalian AChR. These concentrations correspond very well with the blood level of these drugs found in vivo to produce a therapeutic response against organophosphate poisoning.",

Benactyzine is used to treat organophosphate poisoning and drofenine acts on smooth muscle to stop muscle spasms. Both of these drugs are esters. After they enter the bloodstream, they will interact with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE; acylcholine acyl hydrolase: EC 3.1.1.8), which has an ability to hydrolyze a wide variety of esters. Therefore, the kinetic analysis of their inhibitory effects on human serum BChE was examined using butyrylthiocholine as substrate. Both drugs were competitive inhibitors of BChE and the Ki values of benactyzine and drofenine were calculated to be 0.010 +/- 0.001 and 0.003 +/- 0.000 mM, respectively, using the Systat (version 5.03, 1991) nonlinear regression analysis software package. According to these parameters, drofenine is a more potent competitive inhibitor of BChE than benactyzine.",

It has central and peripheral anticholinergic effects, and when administered intramuscularly, it has a rapid onset of action.

As an anticholinergic drug it could also be expected to produce vision changes by its action on the intraocular musculature controlling the pupil and lens accommodation. ... The drug /was tested/ on six volunteer subjects to establish the visual side-effects of intramuscular administration. ... It reduced static and dynamic visual acuity, increased pupil size, reduced amplitude of accommodation and contrast sensitivity, while having little or no effect on glare recovery, color vision, intraocular pressure, stereoacuity, oculomotor tracking, and distance heterophoria. Benactyzine produced reductions in visual performance for up to 3 hr and had the greatest effects on functions which have significant cognitive components. ...",

Subjects simultaneously operated a primate equilibrium platform and responded to a multiple alternative reaction task. Performance on both the continuous and discrete tasks were progressively degraded as benactyzine dose increased. At the higher doses it appeared that they concentrated their efforts on one of the tasks while neglecting the other. Thus, performance on one task might be normal and at the same time performance on another task would be degraded.",

The results showed that benactyzine, caramiphen, and trihexyphenidyl reduced rats' innate preference for novelty, whereas biperiden and procyclidine did not. When benactyzine, caramiphen, and trihexyphenidyl were combined with physostigmine the cognitive impairment disappeared. This counteracting effect, however, caused changes in locomotor and rearing activities not seen by each drug alone. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and anticholinergics used as prophylactics can offset each other, but exceptions are observed in a previous study when a very potent anticholinergic (scopolamine) or a high dose of procyclidine still results in cognitive deficits in spite of coadministration with physostigmine. /Benactyzine hydrochloride/",

Atropine (1 and 5 mg/kg), scopolamine (0.02-0.20 mg/kg), benactyzine (1-4 mg/kg), trihexyphenidyl (1-10 mg/kg), and aprophen (5-20 mg/kg) were all found to increase the number of errors performed by overtrained rats during the spatial but not during the visual trials. Although all the anticholinergic drugs tested induced specific working memory impairment at low doses, they differentially affected other, simultaneously recorded, behavioral parameters. Thus, while atropine affected most of the recorded parameters, aprophen induced only a mild effect. Benactyzine was found to have the most specific effect on working memory, with only minimal side effects, a combination that supports its use as the preferred psychopharmacological model of working memory impairment.",

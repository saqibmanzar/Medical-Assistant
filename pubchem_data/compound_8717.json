When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.0X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,4,5-trimethylaniline will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,4,5-trimethylaniline will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hrs. If released to soil, 2,4,5-trimethylaniline is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 198. However, mobility of 2,4,5-trimethylaniline in soil may be strongly affected by reactions with humic material. Also, a pKa value of 5.09 suggests that 2,4,5-trimethylaniline will exist partially in the protonated form in moist soils and the protonated form of 2,4,5-trimethylaniline is expected to bind strongly to soil surfaces and not volatilize. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 and 129 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces may be attenuated by adsorption to humic material in the water column. The protonated form of 2,4,5-trimethylaniline is not expected to volatilize from water. If released into water, 2,4,5-trimethylaniline is expected to adsorb slightly to sediment and suspended solids in water based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to 2,4,5-trimethylaniline may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,4,5-trimethylaniline is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.48X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 and 129 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces may be attenuated by adsorption to humic material in the water column(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Three female rats (2/30 at 180 mg/kg/day, 1/30 at 60 mg/kg/day) died of a potential toxic cause on Days 15, 65, and 42, respectively. High dose rats exhibited clinical signs including convulsions and sialorrhea. A high dose regimen was also associated with diminished weight gain with decreased feed consumption in males, reduced feed consumption in 92-day females, slight platelet count elevations (males and females), and slightly depressed aspartate aminotransferase activity in males. On necropsy, \"relevent lesions\" in the study lethalities included pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage and sanguinous nasal discharge in the 65-day high dose female; congested lungs in the 15-day high dose female; salivation and hyperemic lungs in the 42-day 60 mg/kg female. While microscopic examination suggested gavage error as cause of death in 2 lethalities, one high-dose female exhibited slight congestion of lungs, liver, and kidneys, and minor hemorrhage of the thymus. At terminal necropsy, organ weights were increased, including relative liver (60, 180 mg/kg/day males and females), kidney (all-dose males and 180 mg/kg females), brain (180 mg/kg/day males), adrenal (20, 180 mg/kg/day males), testes (180 mg/kg/day males), and ovary (180 mg/kg/day females) weights. Increased organ weights were also significant on Interim 43-day sacrifice, including relative liver (60, 180 mg/kg males; 180 mg/kg females), kidney (180 mg/kg males), brain (20, 180 mg/kg males), adrenal (20, 180 mg/kg/day males), and testes (20, 180 mg/kg/day males) weights; absolute heart and relative heart to brain ratios were significantly decreased in 92-day males, while 43-day 20 mg/kg/day females had increased relative heart to brain ratios. Both 60 and 180 mg/kg/day regimens in males and females were associated with hemorrhage and thickening of the epithelial nonglandular stomach, the epithelial expansion attributable to acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, acute inflammatory cell infiltrates, and cytodegenerative necrosis on microscopic exam. Treatment-related lesions were not observed in 20 mg/kg/day males or females.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-vinylpyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-vinylpyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 6.8 and 13 hours, respectively. If released to soil, 2-vinylpyridine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 160. 2-Vinylpyridine has a pKa of 4.98, which indicates that this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in moist acidic soils; cations adsorb more strongly to soils than neutral molecules. Therefore, the mobility of 2-vinylpyridine is expected to be much lower in acidic soils than in neutral or alkaline soils. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, in moist acidic soils, where the protonated form is the dominant species, volatilization will not be important because cations do not volatilize. 2-Vinylpyridine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of 2-vinylpyridine in soil or water is not expected to be a major fate process based on a single aerobic screening test showing that 2-vinylpyridine was not biodegraded over a 4-week period. If released into water, 2-vinylpyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 10 and 80 days, respectively. In acidic waters where the protonated form is the dominant species, volatilization will not be an important fate process since cations do not volatilize. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 2-vinylpyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-vinylpyridine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the most common non-occupational exposure is likely to result from either passive or active inhalation of cigarette smoke containing 2-vinylpyridine. (SRC)",

Therefore, the mobility of 2-vinylpyridine is expected to be much lower in acidic soils than in neutral or alkaline soil(SRC).

The potential for volatilization of 2-vinylpyridine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(5).

According to a classification scheme(5), a estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation of 2-vinylpyridine in water is not expected to be a major fate process based on a single aerobic screening test showing that 2-vinylpyridine was not biodegraded over a 4 week period(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2-vinylpyridine is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 10 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 80 days(SRC). 2-Vinylpyridine's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, 2-vinylpyridine is a weak base with a pKa of 4.98(4), which indicates this compound will partially exist in the protonated form in acidic conditions; cations do not volatilize from either moist soil or water surfaces. The potential for volatilization of 2-vinylpyridine from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

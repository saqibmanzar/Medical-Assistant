ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Severe exposure may cause central nervous system depression with hypertension or with circulatory failure and respiratory depression. There have been cases of dizziness, involuntary jerky movements of the limbs, nervous movements and burning sensation in the throat. Other symptoms of exposure include blurred vision, cyanosis, mydriasis with absent light reflex, coma, clonic convulsions, respiratory arrest and alarming disturbances in cardiac mechanisms. In young children, exposure can cause severe intoxication and death. Glaucoma and widely dilated unreactive pupils have been reported. Symptoms of exposure to this type of compound include lethargy, drowsiness, fatigue, hypnosis, vertigo, ataxia, tinnitus, central nervous system hyperexcitability, sedation, tremors, anxiety, insomnia, toxic psychoses, gastrointestinal disturbances, anorexia, nausea, abdominal distress, diarrhea and pulmonary edema.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

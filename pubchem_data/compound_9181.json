When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

However, no unequivocal evidence could be obtained for the formation of the ultimate carcinogens (the t-3,4-dihydrodiol-1,2-epoxides). K-region oxidation was induced by phenobarbital, whereas the formation of non-K-region metabolites incr after BkF treatment in the case of benz(c)acridine.",

The polynuclear aromatic compounds & the internal standard are trapped individually as they elute from the GC column. The amount of each cmpd in the collected fraction is determined by UV spectrophotometry. Appropriate corrections are applied as determined by the recovery of the internal standard.

A total dose of 0.50 or 1.05 umol of compound was administered ip to preweanling mice and tumorigenic activity was determined when the mice were 33-37 wk old. B(c)ACR was a weak carcinogen producing an average of 2.5 lung tumors/mouse and 0.15 liver tumor/male mouse at the 1.05-umol dose. Of the 5 metabolically possible trans-dihydrodiols of B(c)ACR, only trans-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydro-B(c)ACR (B(c)ACR 3,4-dihydrodiol) had high tumorigenic activity. B(c)ACR 3,4-dihydrodiol induced 2-and 10-fold more pulmonary and hepatic tumors, respectively, than did the parent compound while the trans-1,2-, 5,6-, 8,9- and 10,11-dihydrodiols had very little or no tumorigenic activity. Both of the diastereomeric bay-region 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxides, in which the epoxide oxygen is either cis (isomer 1) or trans (isomer 2) to the benzylic hydroxyl group, had tumorigenic activity. Isomer 2 was the most tumorigenic derivative tested, inducing at least 60,7 and 12 times more lung tumors per mouse than did isomer 1, B(c)ACR 3,4-dihydrodiol and B(c)ACR, respectively. The K-region 5,6-oxide and 2 non-bay-region diol-epoxides (isomer 2 of B(c)ACR 8,9-diol-10,11-epoxide and B(c)ACR 10,11- diol-8,9-epoxide) were weakly active or inactive at the dose tested. The demonstration that B(c)ACR 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide-2 is exceptionally tumorigenic and that its metabolic precursor, B(C)ACR 3,4-dihydrodiol, is more active than the parent hydrocarbon, B(C)-ACR, support the concept that isomer 2 of the bay-region diolepoxide may be an ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of B(c)ACR.",

Benz(c)acridine is released in stack effluents from residential coal-burning furnaces and in incineration effluents from oil refineries. It occurs in emissions associated with coal-tar, coke ovens, creosote and in combustion products from fossil fuels that have a high nitrogen content. Benz(c)acridine is a component of cigarette smoke and condensate. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.8X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benz(c)acridine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere.  Monitoring data suggest it will exist primarily in the particulate phase. Vapor-phase benz(c)acridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 14 hours. Particulate-phase benz(c)acridine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benz(c)acridine strongly absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and has been shown to photodegrade readily in aqueous solutions exposed to sunlight; therefore, exposure to sunlight may be an important fate process in air, on soils surfaces or in water. If released to soil, benz(c)acridine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.8X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benz(c)acridine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data specific to benz(c)acridine were not available. If released into water, benz(c)acridine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 420 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are not likely to appreciably bioconcentrate in organisms which have microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme allows the organism to metabolize PAH's. Photodegradation may be an important fate process in waters exposed to sunlight. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Human exposure to benz(c)acridine occurs primarily through inhalation of polluted air, by ingestion of food and water contaminated with combustion products, and through exposure to cigarette smoke.

Monitoring data suggest it will exist primarily in the particulate phase(3,4). Vapor-phase benz(c)acridine  is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 14 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.8X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase benz(c)acridine may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benz(c)acridine strongly absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and has been shown to photodegrade readily in aqueous solutions exposed to sunlight(6); therefore, photodegradation  may be an important fate process(SRC).",

In cyclohexane solution, benz(c)acridine exhibits absorption maximas at 315, 330, 338, 346, 355, 364, 374 and 383 nm(2); therefore, since benz(c)acridine absorbs at wavelenghts >290 nm, it may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). In photodegradation tests using aqueous solutions of benz(c)acridine exposed to solar radiation, benz(c)acridine had a half-life 4.52 times longer than benzo(a)pyrene's half-life of 15.5 minutes indicating that photo-oxidation under sunlight may be an important fate process in the environment(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

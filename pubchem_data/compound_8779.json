PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

In an animal study, high doses of Ca-DTPA led to the loss of zinc and manganese mainly from the small intestine, skeleton, pancreas, and testes. Dosing over several days resulted in mobilization or binding of endogenous metals in exchange for calcium and a consequent impairment of metalcontrolled or activated systems. The rate and amount of endogenous metal depletion increased with split daily dosing and with the length of treatment. Depletion of these endogenous metals can interfere with necessary mitotic cellular processes. Over longer time periods, depletion of zinc due to Ca-DTPA therapy may result in transient inhibition of a metalloenzyme-daminolevulinic acid dehydrase (ALAD) in the blood and suppressed hematopoiesis. /Ca-DTPA/",

Results showed that only thorium in mixed-ligand solution was entirely translocated from the muscle, with the greatest part being excreted from the body. In this case, the whole-body retention of thorium decreased to 16% of the injected radioactivity within 2 d, 13% being retained in the skeleton. Studies on the decorporation of 234Th + 232Th nitrates from a rat wound simulated with i.m. injection have also been carried out. The greatest translocation of thorium and its excretion was achieved with a single local injection of the mixed-ligand (citrate + CaDTPA) solution when compared with those of citrate or CaDTPA alone. The efficiency of mixed-ligand treatment decreased with its delay. On day 2 post-therapy, the whole-body content of thorium decreased to 30, 37 and 55% of injected radioactivity when the local treatment started immediately, postponed to 1 h or 24 h, after i.m. injection of thorium, respectively. In control rats without treatment, there was only a slight decrease in the content of thorium in the whole body /CaDTPA/.",

The radioactive chelates are then excreted by glomerular filtration into the urine. In animal studies, Ca-DTPA forms less stable chelates with uranium and neptunium in vivo resulting in the deposition of these elements in tissues including the bone. Ca-DTPA treatments are not expected to be effective for uranium and neptunium. Radioactive iodine is not bound by DTPA. /Ca-DTPA/",

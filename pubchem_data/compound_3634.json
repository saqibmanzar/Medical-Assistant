When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In other cellular systems like cattle kidney cells in culture, plant cells, and mouse lymphocytes, the drug could be demonstrated to bind heterochromatin and euchromatin, irrespective of the packing state of the latter. When penetrating the various heterochromatin types (with the exception of T. infestans), the drug induced a chromatin loosening that could favor incidence of chromatin breaks. The variation of hycanthone binding to DNA in different cell types is possibly related to differences in composition, stereo-arrangement and stability of the DNA-protein complexes involved.",

All the mice received a single i.m. injection of hycanthone methanesulfonate (76 mg/kg), IA-4-N-oxide (80 mg/kg), or an equivalent volume of the solvent, 0.9% NaCl solution, 42 hr after partial hepatectomy. Of the mice receiving hycanthone methanesulfonate and living 200 days or longer, hepatocellular carcinoma was seen in 11.5% and liver sarcoma was seen in 4.2%. This type of malignant neoplasm was not seen in the animals receiving either IA-4-N-oxide or 0.9% NaCl solution. In addition, mice receiving hycanthone methanesulfonate showed a significantly higher incidence of both type 1 (43% compared to 21% in controls) and type 2 (21% compared to 12% in controls) hepatocyte neoplasms. Mice receiving IA-4-N-oxide showed no increased incidence of neoplasms.",

These effects were the result of dominant lethal mutations induced in maturing oocytes and not of maternal toxicity as indicated by the presence of chromosomal aberrations observed at first-cleavage metaphase of zygotes obtained from treated females.

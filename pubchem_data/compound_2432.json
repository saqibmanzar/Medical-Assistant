PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

This may suggest that an important relationship exists between the two.  Note that a co-occurring gene entity is organism non-specific and could refer to a gene, protein, or enzyme.  Also note that this content is not human curated.  It is generated by text-mining algorithms that can be fooled such that a co-occurrence may be happenstance or a casual mention. The lists are ordered by relevancy as indicated by count of publications and other statistics, with the most relevant mentions appearing at the top.",

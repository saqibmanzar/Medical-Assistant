They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Apparently, for these two quinones the predominant metabolic pathway in both the BF-2 and HepG2 cells involved redox cycling via a one-electron reduction reaction, generating reactive oxygen intermediates that consumed intracellular glutathione. Pretreatment of the BF-2 cells with BSO, but not with dicoumarol, potentiated the toxicity of 1,4-NQ, again indicating that metabolism occurred via one electron reduction. However, for the HepG2 cells, pretreatment with dicoumarol, but not with BSO, potentiated the cytotoxicity of 1,4-NQ.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Dichlone is found on List A, which contains most food use pesticides and consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA '88. Case No: 0008; Pesticide type: fungicide; Case Status: No products containing the pesticide are actively registered. Therefore, we are characterizing the case as \"cancelled.\" Under FIFRA, pesticide producers may voluntarily cancel their registered products. EPA also may cancel pesticide registrations if registrants fail to pay required fees or make/meet certain reregistration commitments, or if EPA reaches findings of unreasonable adverse effects.; Active ingredient (AI): Dichlone; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 10/05/90; AI Status: The active ingredient is no longer contained in any registered products.

Dose levels of 0.42, or 1.05 g CNQ/kg/wk were given to female Wistar-rats in a 2.5 g block of white chocolate as a palatable vehicle for ingestion studies. Because rats reduced intake of the vehicle almost to zero during chronic ingestion, acute ingestion experiments were carried out for 1 week; CNQ ingestion was 281.1 +/-47.7 mg for the medium dose level and 625.5 +/-147.4 mg for the high dose level. For subcutaneous studies, CNQ was given to male Long-Evans-rats at 16.6 mg/kg. Acute oral administration caused significant increases in cytochrome-P-450, DT-diaphorase, and aniline-hydroxylase activities. The increases in aniline-hydroxylase and DT-diaphorase were directly related to the concentration of CNQ and actual CNQ intake. At 24 and 48 hours after subcutaneous injection an increase was noted in mitochondrial DT-diaphorase activity. All enzyme activities were significantly different from controls by 48 hours post injection, suggesting that the first interaction of CNQ or a CNQ metabolite is at the mitochondrial level when subcutaneously administered. The authors concluded that the route of administration plays a significant role in determining the intracellular effects of CNQ.",

Larval mortality occurred in a time-and-dose dependent manner, with an LC17 of 0.01% and an LC50 of 0.26% CNQ at day-5. Extracts of larvae fed control, 0.01, and 0.25% CNQ diets for 5 days were assayed for antioxidant enzymes. While 0.01% CNQ had a mild effect, 0.25% CNQ profoundly increased levels of all antioxidant enzymes that were examined. The increases as compared to control were: 5.3-, 1.9-, 3.2-, 2.6-, 2.8-, and 3.5-fold higher for superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione transferase and its peroxidase activity, glutathione reductase and DT-diaphorase, respectively. At 0.01% CNQ, the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were similar to the control group. However, despite the induction from 0.25% CNQ of all enzymes examined, the lipid peroxidation was not attenuated; the TBARS were 29.7% over the control value. High mortalities and CNQ-induced pathologies reflected in retarded growth, wasting syndrome, and diuresis clearly indicated that the insect sustained severe oxidant-induced injuries before appropriate defenses were fully mobilized. Thus, this quinone causes an oxidative stress in a model insect species analogous to that observed in mammalian species.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dichlone will be in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dichlone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 12 days. Vapor-phase dichlone will also be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 360 days. Dichlone absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Particulate-phase dichlone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, dichlone is expected to have no mobility based upon soil adsorption studies. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.02X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Dichlone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-6 mm Hg. Results of degradation studies under fieldhouse conditions, utilizing both sterile and non-sterile tests, suggest that disappearance of dichlone in moist soil, freshwater and sewage is primarily abiotic in nature with some biotic involvement. Soil dissipation half-lives of 1 to 4 days have been observed in laboratory studies utilizing moist soils. A soil half-life of nearly 3 months was observed in laboratory study utilizing dry soil. If released into water, dichlone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon soil adsorption studies. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The experimentally determined half-life of dichlone in water (pH 7, 29 \u00b0C) is 5 days. In solution, dichlone is reported to decompose slowly by light. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since dichlone is no longer produced or used in the US (1998). (SRC)",

Volatilization of dichlone from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.02X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Dichlone is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-6 mm Hg(3). In a silt loam soil dissipation study (soil pH 6.4, temperature of 26 \u00b0C), loss of dichlone in moist soil followed first order kinetics with an observed rate constant of 0.7/day which corresponds to a half-life of about 1 day(4); in air-dried soil (pH 6.2), dissipation was much slower with 45 percent of initial dichlone remaining after 3 months(4). Results of degradation studies under fieldhouse conditions, utilizing both sterile and non-sterile tests, suggest that disappearance of dichlone in moist soil, freshwater and sewage is primarily abiotic in nature with some biotic involvement(5); in non-sterile samples of moist soil, sewage and fresh water, one-half of added dichlone disappeared in about 4, 3 and 4 days of incubation, respectively(5). The experimentally determined half-life of dichlone in water (pH 7, 29 \u00b0C) is 5 days(4), which suggests dichlone is disappearing in moist soil primarily due to aqueous hydrolysis(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(2) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.02X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(3). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.65(5) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Results of degradation studies, utilizing both sterile and non-sterile tests, suggest that disappearance of dichlone in moist soil, freshwater and sewage is primarily abiotic in nature with some biotic involvement(7); in non-sterile samples of moist soil, sewage and fresh water, one-half of added dichlone disappeared in about 4, 3 and 4 days of incubation, respectively(7). The experimentally determined half-life of dichlone in water (pH 7, 29 \u00b0C) is 5 days(8). In solution, dichlone is reported to decompose slowly by light(9).",

Vapor-phase dichlone is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 12 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.34X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Vapor-phase dichlone is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 320 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.6X10-19 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Dichlone absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Particulate-phase dichlone may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC).",

Dichlone was less stable than chloranil in 3 of the 4 ecosystems tested. In non-sterile samples of soil, sewage and fresh water, one-half of added dichlone had disappeared in 4, 3 and 4 days of incubation at 30 \u00b0C, respectively; 23 weeks of incubation in sea water was necessary to degrade 50% of dichlone.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 12 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of dichlone with ozone has been estimated as 3.6X10-19 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 320 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). Dichlone absorbs at wavelengths >290(3) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). In solution, dichlone is reported to be slowly decomposed by light(4); it is reported to be stable in the dry state(4). Dichlone is stable in acidic media, but hydrolyzed by alkalis(4). The experimentally determined half-life of dichlone in a pH 7 buffered solution (containing 1% acetone) at 29 \u00b0C in the dark is 5 days(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

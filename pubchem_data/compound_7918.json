For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

By converting the reactive chemicals into stable derivatives, the collection sensitivity of the monitor is increased.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used in manufacture of acetyl compounds, cellulose acetates. The other applications include uses as acetylizer and solvent in examining wool fat, glycerol, fatty and volatile oils, resins; detection of rosin. It is widely used in organic synthesis, as dehydrating agent in nitrations, sulfonations and other reactions where removal of water is necessary. To reduce heroin availability, the United Nations has encouraged nations to control acetic anhydride, an essential (\"precursor\") chemical typically necessary to the drug's production. HUMAN STUDIES: Known to be a severe eye and skin irritant. Severe burns and vesiculation of human skin have been reported from liquid splashes, and concentrated vapor produces primary irritation. The immediate effect of exposure at vapor concentrations above 5 ppm is acute irritation of the eye. Inhalation can cause nasopharyngeal and upper respiratory tract irritation, with burning sensations, cough and dyspnea. Prolonged exposure may lead to pulmonary edema and death. ANIMAL STUDIES: Inhalation of 2000 ppm by rats for 4 hours caused deaths. It caused severe eye burns in rabbits. Rats were exposed to inhalation of vapors containing 0, 1, 5, or 20 ppm acetic anhydride for 6 hr/day, 5 days per week for 13 weeks. Clinical observations of eye and respiratory tract irritation and reduced body weights were observed primarily at 20 ppm. Inhalation exposure of pregnant female rats to 0, 25, 100, or 400 ppm 6 hr/day during days 6-15 of gestation caused fetotoxicity in a screening study with female rats exposed to the highly irritating, maternally toxic dose of 100 ppm vapor during gestation. In maternal animals at 100 ppm, severe respiratory tract irritation and body weight reduction were observed, and at 25 ppm substantial irritation of the respiratory tract was observed. No developmental effects were seen at 25 ppm even though substantial irritation of the respiratory tract was observed in maternal animals. Acetic anhydride was negative for mutagenicity in five Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA1535, TA1537, TA97, TA98, and TA100) in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The results of various laboratory tests with aquatic organisms, in which the toxic threshold concentrations for acetic anhydride were found to be about half those for acetic acid, suggest an initial toxic effect, so long as not all of the substance has hydrolyzed to acetic acid (during the first few minutes).",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acetic anhydride will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase acetic anhydride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 190 days. Acetic anhydride does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to moist soil, hydrolysis to acetic acid is the major fate process. Acetic anhydride may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, acetic anhydride will rapidly hydrolyze to acetic acid; the half-life of acetic anhydride in water is 4.4 minutes at 25 \u00b0C. Bioconcentration of acetic anhydride in aquatic organisms is unlikely due its rapid hydrolysis. Occupational exposure to acetic anhydride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acetic anhydride is produced or used. No monitoring data were found for acetic anhydride. Due to acetic anhydride's rapid hydrolysis, it is unlikely that the general population would be exposed to this chemical; however, acetic anhydride may exist as a vapor in dry air. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase acetic anhydride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 190 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.4X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

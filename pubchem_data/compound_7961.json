Bromobenzene is also used as an additive to motor oils and as a crystallizing solvent. Release of bromobenzene to the environment may occur during its production and the production of phenyl magnesium bromide, as well as in its use as a solvent and as an additive in motor oil (HSDB, 2003). It has been detected at low frequencies and at low concentrations in samples of food, ambient air, and finished water.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

To test this hypothesis, the effect of chemicals known to alter the toxicity and biotransformation of bromobenzene (ie, cytochrome p450 inducers and inhibitors) on the biliary excretion of bromobenzene-glutathione was studied in rats. Bromobenzene-glutathione was the major bromobenzene metabolite in bile. A linear relationship was observed between the dosage of bromobenzene administered and bromobenzene-glutathione excreted into bile, up to a dosage of 250 umol/kg of bromobenzene. Of the inducers tested, Phenobarbital, which is known to increase the toxicity of bromobenzene, dramatically increased 1700 m1 the rate of biliary excretion of bromobenzene-glutathione over that in control animals. In contrast, 3-methylcholanthrene, which is known to decrease the hepatotoxicity of bromobenzene, decreased the biliary excretion of bromobenzene-glutathione (56%). Inhibitors of p450, such as SKF 525-A and piperonyl butoxide which are known to decrease the activation and hepatotoxicity of bromobenzene, also decreased the biliary excretion of bromobenzene-glutathione. These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that the biliary excretion of bromobenzene-glutathione reflects the formation of the reactive bromobenzene metabolite in liver and the rate of biliary excretion can be used to determine factors that are important in determining the toxicity of bromobenzene.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home.

The rate of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in hepatocytes was determined by measuring the extent of incorporation of labeled thymidine into DNA, using autoradiography. The maximum rate of UDS in treated cell cultures (2.3 net grains/nucleus) was greater than that of the negative controls (<1 net grain/ nucleus), indicating that the test compound was positive for UDS in human fibroblasts under the conditions of this assay.

If released to the the atmosphere, bromobenzene will exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 4.18 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase bromobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 21 days. An estimated Koc value of 268 suggests that bromobenzene will have moderate mobility in soil. Volatilizaton from moist soil surfaces should occur based upon an experimental Henry's Law constant of 2.08X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces should be important given the vapor pressure of this compound. Bromobenzene is not biodegraded in screening studies using an activated sludge as inoculum; 0% degradation was reported after four weeks. In water, bromobenzene may adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its estimated Koc value of 268. This compound will volatilize from water surfaces given its experimental Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should be low to moderately high based on measured BCF values ranging from 8.8 to 190. Given the commercial uses of bromobenzene, human exposure appears to be likely from occupational situations through dermal and inhalation routes and consumer exposure to motor oil. Due to the compound's presence in food, ambient air, and finished water, general population exposure may be possible by ingestion and inhaltion routes. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Disposal of secondary sewage effluent by rapid infiltration since 1936 has produced a plume of contaminated groundwater over 3500 m long near Falmouth, MA. Bromobenzene was identified as a contaminant with a maximum concn of 10 ng/l(2). Bromobenzene was found to be a contaminant in groundwater from a well near a chemical plant in Switzerland. Results showed that a maximum of 16 ug/l bromobenzene was present in well number one, which was closest to the chemical plant(3). Screening of 1174 community wells and 617 private wells was conducted in Wisconsin in the early 1980's. GCMS results showed that bromobenzene was detected in the wells, in unreported concns(4). Random samples of finished water were collected near a point of entrance to the distribution system from the public water systems in Ohio during 1981 and 1982. A total of 479 samples was taken statewide. Bromobenzene was detected three times from a random selection of 280 sites serving fewer that 10,000 persons at an average concn of 0.5 ug/l. Bromobenzene was detected one time from a random selection of 186 sites serving more than 10,000 persons at an average concn of 0.5 ug/l(5).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

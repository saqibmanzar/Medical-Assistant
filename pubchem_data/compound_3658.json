In addition, hydroxyzine hydrochloride crosses the blood-brain barrier and acts on the histamine H1-receptors in the central nervous system. (NCI05)",

The efficacy of hydroxyzine as an anxiolytic agent during long-term administration (i.e., longer than 4 months) has not been established; most clinicians believe that benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and meprobamate are more effective than hydroxyzine for anxiety. Patients with a history of long-term therapy with hydroxyzine should be evaluated periodically to determine the efficacy and need for further treatment. Hydroxyzine should not be used as the sole agent for the treatment of depression or psychoses. /Included in US product label/",

Hydroxyzine may potentiate the effects of central nervous system (CNS) depressants following general anesthesia - patients maintained on hydroxyzine should receive reduced doses of any CNS depressants required. Hydroxyzine is reported to prolong the QT/QTc interval based on postmarketing reports of rare events of Torsade de Pointes, cardiac arrest, and sudden death, and should be used with caution in patients with an increased baseline risk for QTc prolongation.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Plasma drug levels were determined with high-pressure liquid chromatography. Pharmacodynamic studies evaluated the suppressive effect on histamine and anticanine IgE-mediated cutaneous wheal formation. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlations were determined with computer modelling. The mean systemic availability of oral hydroxyzine was 72%. Hydroxyzine was rapidly converted to cetirizine regardless of the route of administration. The mean area-under-the-curve was eight and ten times higher for cetirizine than hydroxyzine after intravenous and oral dosing, respectively. After oral administration of hydroxyzine, the mean peak concentration of cetirizine was approximately 2.2 ug mL(-1) and that of hydroxyzine 0.16 ug mL(-1). The terminal half-life for cetirizine varied between 10 and 11 hr after intravenous and oral administration of hydroxyzine. A sigmoidal relationship was fit to the data comparing cetirizine plasma concentration to wheal suppression. Maximum inhibition (82% and 69% for histamine and anticanine IgE-mediated skin reactions, respectively) was observed during the first 8 hr, which correlated with a plasma concentration of cetirizine greater than 1.5 ug mL(-1). Pharmacological modelling suggested that increasing either hydroxyzine dosages or frequencies of administration would not result in histamine inhibition superior to that obtained with twice daily hydroxyzine at 2 mg kg(-1). In conclusion, there was rapid conversion of hydroxyzine to cetirizine. The reduction of wheal formation appeared almost entirely due to cetirizine. Pharmacodynamic modelling predicted that maximal antihistamine effect would occur with twice daily oral administration of hydroxyzine at 2 mg kg(-1).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Exposure to an allergen results in degranulation of mast cells and basophils, which then release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Histamine binds to, and activates, H<sub>1</sub> receptors, which results in the further release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukins, from basophils and mast cells. These downstream effects of histamine binding are responsible for a wide variety of allergic symptoms, such as pruritus, rhinorrhea, and watery eyes.  Hydroxyzine is a potent inverse agonist of histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptors - inverse agonists are agents that are considered to have a \"negative efficacy\", so rather than simply blocking activity at a receptor they actively dampen its activity. Inverse agonism at these receptors is responsible for hydroxyzine's efficacy in the treatment of histaminic edema, flare, and pruritus.  Hydroxyzine is not a cortical depressant, so its sedative properties likely occur at the subcortical level of the CNS. These sedative properties allow activity as an anxiolytic. Antiemetic efficacy is likely secondary to activity at off-targets.",

Hydroxyzine was found to be a competitive inhibitor of MAO-B (Ki - 38 microM), whereas it had a low potency towards MAO-A (IC50 > 630 microM). Although it was a relatively potent competitive inhibitor of bovine plasma SSAO (Ki approximately 1.5 microM), it was a weak inhibitor of the membrane-bound form of the enzyme from bovine lung (IC50 approximately 1 mM). These findings extend our knowledge of the drug binding capabilities of the amine oxidases and suggest that these interactions may contribute to the complex actions of this drug.",

Hypotension, though unlikely, may be controlled with intravenous fluids and norepinephrine or metaraminol. Do not use epinephrine as hydroxyzine hydrochloride counteracts its pressor action. There is no specific antidote. It is doubtful that hemodialysis would be of any value in the treatment of overdosage with hydroxyzine. However, if other agents such as barbiturates have been ingested concomitantly, hemodialysis may be indicated. (L1712)",

When 10 mg/kg hydroxyzine dihydrochloride were orally administered together with 10 mL/kg of 1 to 15% ethanol solution, blood hydroxyzine concentrations rised in all rabbits given ethanol solution more than 10%. When 10 mL/kg of 15% ethanol solution were orally administered at 1, 2 or 3 hours before oral administration of hydroxyzine, blood hydroxyzine concentrations rised markedly in all cases. Blood hydroxyzine concentrations rised little or a little when hydroxyzine were orally administered immediately after intravenous administration of 5 mL/kg of 20% ethanol solution. It was considered that the main mechanism of a rise of blood hydroxyzine concentration was not metabolic interaction between hydroxyzine and ethanol, but an enhancement of intestinal absorption of hydroxyzine due to ethanol. It was also found that hydroxyzine in blood distributed rapidly into bodily tissues.",

Clinical assessment for signs that may indicate impending seizure activity (hypertonicity, hyperreflexia, or myoclonic jerking) is important.

A case report of neonatal withdrawal of a female infant with Apgar scores of 7 and 9 weighing 2950 g delivered of a mother who had been treated during her entire pregnancy with hydroxyzine 600 mg daily and phenobarbital 60 mg daily. The infant's jitteriness; tachypnea; poor suck and feeding; irritability; clonic movement; and shrill cry are all suggestive of a narcotic withdrawal syndrome. Since the small amount of phenobarbital taken in the weeks preceding delivery would not be expected to result in an early neonatal withdrawal syndrome, it is believed that the patient's symptoms were a result of withdrawal from hydroxyzine.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

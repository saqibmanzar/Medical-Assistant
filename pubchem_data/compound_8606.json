Though it can be applied on its own, Captan is often added as a component of other pesticide mixtures. It is used to control diseases on a number of fruits and vegetables as well as ornamental plants. It also improves the outward appearance of many fruits, making them brighter and healthier-looking. Captan is thought to be a potential carcinogen at prolonged high doses that cause cytotoxicity and regenerative cell hyperplasia. These high doses of captan are many orders of magnitude above those likely to be consumed in the diet, or encountered by individuals in occupational or residential settings. Therefore, captan is not likely to be a human carcinogen nor pose cancer risks of concern.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

This study aimed at performing repeated biological measurements of exposure to captan and folpet in field workers (i) to better assess internal dose along with main routes-of-entry according to tasks and (ii) to establish most appropriate sampling and analysis strategies. The detailed urinary excretion time courses of specific and non-specific biomarkers of exposure to captan and folpet were established in tree farmers (n = 2) and grape growers (n = 3) over a typical workweek (seven consecutive days), including spraying and harvest activities. The impact of the expression of urinary measurements [excretion rate values adjusted or not for creatinine or cumulative amounts over given time periods (8, 12, and 24 hr)] was evaluated. Absorbed doses and main routes-of-entry were then estimated from the 24-hr cumulative urinary amounts through the use of a kinetic model. The time courses showed that exposure levels were higher during spraying than harvest activities. Model simulations also suggest a limited absorption in the studied workers and an exposure mostly through the dermal route. It further pointed out the advantage of expressing biomarker values in terms of body weight-adjusted amounts in repeated 24-hr urine collections as compared to concentrations or excretion rates in spot samples, without the necessity for creatinine corrections.",

The probable metabolic pathways of both the tetrahydrophthalimide and trichloromethylthio moieties have been elucidated. In rats, the tetrahydrophthalimide moiety is excreted, 92% in 48 hr and 97% in 96 hr (85% in the urine and 12 in the feces. The trichloromethylthio moiety is converted to thiophosgene, which is further metabolized to thiazolidine-2-thione-4-carboxylic acid, which is excreted in the urine of orally dosed rats; carbon dioxide is also a product of the metabolism of thiophosgene through the intermediate formation of carbonyl sulfide. Thiophosgene is also detoxified by sulfites present in the gut and is excreted in the urine of orally dosed rats to yield dithiobis(methanesulfonic acid) and its disulfide monooxide derivative.",

The trichloromethylthio moiety is converted to thiophosgene, which is further metabolized to thiazolidine-2-thione-4-carboxylic acid, which is excreted in the urine of orally dosed rats; carbon dioxide is also a product of the metabolism of thiophosgene through the intermediate formation of carbonyl sulfide. Thiophosgene is also detoxified by sulfites present in the gut and is excreted in the urine of orally dosed rats to yield dithiobis(methanesulfonic acid) and its disulfide monooxide derivative.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Products applied to turf at sod farms or golf courses are eligible for reregistration; uses at all other turf sites are being voluntarily cancelled. Wettable powder formulations that are applied aerially are eligible for reregistration, provided either: 1) the products are packaged in water soluble packaging; or 2) the application rates are reduced to a level that is no higher than 1.2 lb ai/A.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer safety standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Captan is found on List A, which contains most pesticides that are used on foods and, hence, have a high potential for human exposure. List A consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA '88. Case No: 0120; Pesticide type: fungicide; Registration Standard Date: 03/06/86; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the RED (Reregistration Eligibility Decision) document.; Active ingredient (AI): captan; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 03/03/95, 10/13/95; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

The technical product is an amorphous powder which is colorless to beige with a pungent odor. Captan is a fungicide used to control diseases of many fruit and ornamental and vegetable crops. It is also used as a spray, root dip or seed treatment to protect young plants against rot and damping off. Captan is also used as a fungicide in wall paper pastes and in hormone rooting powders. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Potential symptoms of overexposure are irritation of eyes, skin, upper respiratory system; blurred vision; dermatitis, skin sensitization; dyspnea; diarrhea, vomiting. Dermatitis and conjunctivitis have been noted. Captan has caused allergic dermatitis and eye irritation in man. Accidents among adult farm workers and secondary exposure of their children can occur. Common human exposure is by the oral, dermal and inhalation routes. In adult male with occupational exposure to captan, who had persistent erythema, itching and desquamation of the face and backs of the hand, skin testing revealed reaction to captan. Addition of 10 ug/mL captan for five hours to human embryonic lung cells L-132 resulted in a 50% reduction of DNA synthesis and a 40% increase in chromosomal breaks, mainly of the chromatid type. Captan induced unscheduled DNA synthesis in SV-40 transformed human VA-4 cells at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 mM, with or without uninduced rat liver microsomal preparations. Negative results were obtained when human lung fibroblasts were exposed to 0.003-1 mM captan with or without uninduced mouse liver microsomal preparation. A small increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis was observed in human lymphocytes treated with 5 ug/mL captan (91.5 % pure). ANIMAL STUDIES: Evidence from animal experiments indicates that ingestion of large quantities may produce gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhea and vomiting. Studies in mice but not in rats have demonstrated a carcinogenic potential.  Sheep and cattle are especially susceptable to captan. Captan, which is an alkylating agent, has shown genotoxic properties in in vitro systems. Long term administration of high dietary levels of captan to mice resulted in the induction of benign and malignant tumors of the small intestine.  In rats, one study indicated the increase of kidney tumors. Studies concerning the teratogenicity of captan are contradictory. In mice and primates there is no evidence of a teratogenic effect. In hamster study no teratogenicity was noted. In another study where captan treatment was initiated at the beginning, captan induced central nervous system and limb defects. In rabbits one study for teratogenicity was negative while another demonstrated limb and head defects and cleft palate. In the dog, no defects were produced in one study, but tail, closure defects and hydrocephalus was induced in another. Many investigators have found captan to be mutagenic and genotoxic under in vitro testing systems when brought into direct contact with susceptible cells. However, most investigators believe captan is not mutagenic or genotoxic in healthy, intact, uncompromised higher animals, except, perhaps, at extremely high dosage. Captan induced reverse mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA1535, TA98, TA1537 and TA1538 without metabolic activation. Addition of metabolic activation resulted in total or partial suppression of mutagenic activity, while pretreatment of the compound with human gastric juice has been reported to enhance mutagenicity. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Captan formulations may pose an environmental risk if released into an aquatic environment.",

Tumor-promoting activity was assessed in six of these groups, and complete carcinogenic activity was assessed in five groups: Untreated controls; benzo(a)pyrene; captan; DMSO; and acetone. Total treatment period was 52 weeks. Surviving mice were sacrificed at end of 1 year. Topical application of captan was found to cause initiation of mouse skin in a two-stage cancer initiation-promotion model. While single application of captan was insufficient to initiate skin tumor development in most mice, multiple exposure to captan resulted in cumulative incidence of 21 tumors, and DMBA plus TPA-treated mice had 90 tumors detected. In this report, captan failed to demonstrate any tumor-promoting or complete carcinogenic activity.",

These 30 patients (M : F 21 : 9) were between 22-81 years of age having dermatitis for 4 days to 20 years with relapses and remissions. Twenty-one patients had seasonal exacerbation. Ten patients attributed exacerbation of dermatitis to exposure to pesticides. Positive patch test reactions from pesticides were observed in 8 patients only. Captan was the most common sensitizer (5 patients), 2 patients were sensitive to propargite. Chlorpyrifos, tree spray oil and thiuram gave positive reaction in 1 patient each. 3 controls from Group-1 showed positive reactions to multiple pesticides.

Measurements of mixer/loader/applicator and hand harvest worker exposures to chemicals in the strawberry fields were made, including dislogeable residues, dermal dosimetry, and urine monitoring. A group of 40 male workers was studied for 3 days. Dermal exposure was measured using long underwear worn under the normal work clothes. The protection provided by gloves was also evaluated. Daily 24 hr urine collection was carried out. Gloves were found to be effective in reducing hand exposure. Based on dislodgeable residue on foliage, the daily dermal exposure was calculated as 96 mg/day, for an effective dose of 46 mg/day. Dermal dosimetry estimated exposure to be about 10 mg/day. Both dislodgeable foliar residue and dermal dosimetry estimates were higher than those from urine monitoring.",

Toxic oral doses produce hypothermia, irritability, listlessness, anorexia, hyporeflexia and oliguria, with a marked glycosuria and hematuria on the first day. Following large doses, death is due to cardiac or respiratory failure. With smaller doses death may be delayed and is then apparently caused by infiltrative meningitis secondary to capillary hemorrhages. Animals dying early showed marked hemorrhagic capillary-venous congestion in the stomach, heart, lungs and highly vascular organs, including the thymus. When death was delayed, autopsy showed leukocytic invasion of the meninges, fatty degeneration of the heart and renal tubules, stress response in adrenals, spleen and thymus, and degenerative changes in pancreas, salivary glands and testes.",

Therefore, a single i.p. dose of captan (20 mg/kg) was given to male Sprague-Dawley rats and its effect on liver microsomal mixed function oxidases and certain serum enzymes (SDH, SGPT and SGOT) was studied. The single dose of captan caused marked depression of microsomal cytochrome P-450 and the activity of benzphetamine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase, and moderate elevation of the serum enzymes indicative of liver damage. However, reduced glutathione (100 mg/kg, i.p.) given prior to captan, appears to decrease the liver toxicity as measured by reduced inhibition of the microsomal enzymes and elevation of serum enzymes activity. The results suggest that glutathione and other compounds containing sulfhydryl groups may protect the subjects from captan-induced liver toxicity.",

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were admin one of two doses of captan for 80 wk, then observed for 33 or 34 wk. The time weighted avg doses for both sexes of rats was 2,525 and 6,050 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated rats of each sex; pooled controls, used for the statistical evaluation, consisted of the matched controls combined with 75 untreated male and 75 untreated female rats from similar bioassays of six other test chemicals. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at 113-114 wk. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were admin the test material at one of two doses, either 8,000 or 16,000 ppm, for 80 wk, then observed for 11 wk. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated mice of each sex; pooled controls, used for statistical evaluation, consisted of the matched controls combined with 80 untreated male and 80 untreated female mice from similar bioassays of six other test chemicals. All surviving mice were /sacrificed/ at 90-91 wk. ... In rats, a positive dose related trend and a difference between incidences of tumors in high dose and pooled control groups were found in females when the data for adrenal cortical adenoma were combined with those for adrenal cortical carcinoma (pooled controls, 0/64, low dose 2/50, high dose 3/47, p=0.047). There was also a positive dose related trend for the incidence of C cell adenoma of the thyroid in female rats (pooled controls 1/66, low dose 1/49, high dose 4/44, p=0.035). These endocrine tumors in female rats are believed to have been spontaneous, and not related to treatment. In mice, the incidences of polypoid carcinoma (adenocarcinoma in adenomatous polyp) of the duodenum were statistically significant using tests for a positive dose related trend both in male mice (pooled controls 0/68, low dose 1/43, high dose 3/46, p=0.033) and in female mice (pooled controls 0/68, low dose 0/49, high dose 3/48, p=0.022). When the incidences of adenomatous polyps (not otherwise specified) were combined with those of polypoid carcinoma for statistical analysis, the tests for male mice indicated a substantial incr in significance (pooled controls 0/68, low dose 3/43, high dose 5/46, p=0.008). It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, tumors in the duodenum of B6C3F1 mice were associated with treatment with captan, but there was no convincing evidence that the tumors observed Osborne-Mendel rats were related to treatment. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rate: Negative; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Positive; Female Mice: Positive.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.0X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates captan will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase captan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 4.4 and 4.1 hours, respectively. Particulate-phase captan will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Captan does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, captan is expected to have very high to moderate mobility based upon Koc values of 33-600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.0X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Captan is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. In field studies using sterile and unsterile soil at pH 7.2 and 50% moisture content, captan, applied to a sandy loam, clay loam and sandy loam soil amended with peat had a reported half-life of 12-20, 5.5-5.9 and 7.7-8.9 days, respectively. If released into water, captan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc range. Captan is hydrolyzed with half-lives of 18.8 hrs, 4.9 hrs and 8.3 min measured in water at pH values of 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Based on the rapid hydrolysis of captan, biodegradation in water is not expected to be an important fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. A reported BCF of 126 in bluegill sunfish suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to captan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where captan is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to captan primarily via ingestion of fruit containing residual pesticide. Limited monitoring data indicate exposure may occur via dermal contact with consumer products containing captan, inhalation of ambient air, and ingestion of contaminated drinking water. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase captan is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone(SRC); the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 4.4 and 1.4 hours(SRC), calculated from respective rate constants of 8.8X10-11 and 2.0X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that were derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase captan may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Captan does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4.4 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of captan with ozone has been estimated as 2.0X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.4 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). Captan readily hydrolyzes in water and is likely to be the predominant pathway of degradation in water(3-4). Over the pH range 2-6, the hydrolysis reaction is pH independent (pseudo-first-order rate constant is 1.8X10-5/sec; half-life 10.70 hr) and from pH 6 to 9, is pH dependent (second-order rate constant for alkaline hydrolysis is 5.7X10-2/M-sec)(3). The hydrolysis products were 4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboximide, carbon dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and sulfur(3). Captan hydrolytic half-life in a river water sample at pH 7.0 and 28 \u00b0C showed pseudo-first-order kinetics with a half-life of 170 minutes(4). In a highly colored natural river water sample (pH 4.7), the degradation rate of captan under midday sunlight was about 30% more rapid than in the dark(4). Photodegradation of captan in soil is secondary to hydrolysis(5); however, indirect photolysis may be important in the decomposition of captan. In sterile and unsterile soil at pH 7 and 50% moisture saturation, half-lives of 12-20, 5.5-5.9 and 7.7-8.9 days were reported for captan applied to sandy loam, clay loam and sandy loam amended with peat, respectively(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(3), these Koc values suggest that captan is expected to generally have high to moderate mobility in soil(SRC). A measured organic matter partition coefficient for captan in soil with 3.53% organic matter is 115(4). In field studies at six different sites, however, captan was shown to have slight to no mobility(5). One study predicted that captan would leach <10 cm in a loam soil at 25 \u00b0C under annual rainfall of 150 cm(6). Turf thatch has been shown to increase sorption by a factor of 10(7).",

Captan was detected during the FDA's program for monitoring pesticide residues from 1978 to 1982 (49,877 samples)(2) and 1982 to 1986 (49,055 samples)(3). Captan was detected in 100 of 13,980 food samples collected by state food laboratories in 10 states during fiscal year (FY) 1988; one sample of the 100 detects was considered to contain captan at concentrations high enough for regulatory concern(4). Captan was detected in 145 of 13,085 food samples during a similar study conducted in FY 1989; 5 samples contained captan at concentrations high enough for regulatory concern(4). Captan was listed as one of the pesticide residues detected in a 1992 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) survey of domestic and imported foods(5).",

An estimation of the leaf surface residue transfer rate from strawberries to Florida strawberry harvester clothing was 1.44 to 4.33 mg/hr(3). Dermal and inhalation exposure to captan for commercial apple growers using air blast sprayers was 2.78 mg/hr and 0.0045 mg/hr, respectively(4). During the operations of mixing and spraying captan, rates of exposure were reported as 770-9430 and 71.4-656.3 ng/minute, respectively(5). The average exposure to captan in personnel participating in an orchard spray program (apples/peaches) was 1.94 mg/man/hr, extrapolated from mean residue values obtained from analyzing blotter paper patches(6). Residual captan concentrations decreased sharply upon hand washing after use but was still evident 7 days later(7).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

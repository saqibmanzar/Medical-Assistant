When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

In tracer studies, it was found that approximately 20% of an injected dose of phylloquinone (Vitamin K metabolite) was found in the urine whereas about 40-50 %  was excreted in the feces via the biliary system. The proportion of drug excreted was the same regardless of whether the injected dose was 1 mg or 45 \u00b5g. It can, therefore, be inferred that about 60-70% percent of the amounts of phylloquinone absorbed from each vitamin-K containing meal will be lost to the body by excretion.  Two major human excretion products have been identified: carboxylic acids with 5 and 7-carbon sidechains that are excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates. The biliary metabolites have not been clearly identified but are initially excreted as water-soluble conjugates and become lipid soluble during their passage through the gut, probably through deconjugation by the gut flora. There is no evidence for body stores of vitamin K being conserved by an enterohepatic circulation. Vitamin K itself is too lipophilic to be excreted in the bile and the sidechain-shortened carboxylic acid metabolites are not biologically active.",

Vitamin K is a group of lipophilic, hydrophobic vitamins that exist naturally in two forms (and in 3 synthetic forms): vitamin K1, which is found in plants, and vitamin K2, which is synthesized by bacteria. Vitamin K is an important dietary component because it is necessary as a cofactor in the activation of vitamin K dependent proteins. Metabolism of vitamin K occurs mainly in the liver. In the first step, vitamin K is reduced to its quinone form by a quinone reductase such as NADPH dehydrogenase. Reduced vitamin K is the form required to convert vitamin K dependent protein precursors to their active states. It acts as a cofactor to the integral membrane enzyme vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylase (along with water and carbon dioxide as co-substrates), which carboxylates glutamyl residues to gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues on certain proteins, activating them. Each converted glutamyl residue produces a molecule of vitamin K epoxide, and certain proteins may have more than one residue requiring carboxylation. To end the cycle, the vitamin K epoxide is returned to vitamin K via the vitamin K epoxide reductase enzyme, also an integral membrane protein. The vitamin K dependent proteins include various important coagulation factors, such as prothrombin. Warfarin and other coumarin drugs act as anticoagulants by blocking vitamin K epoxide reductase.",

The two vitamin K-dependent proteins found in bone are osteocalcin, also known as bone G1a (gamma-carboxyglutamate) protein or BGP, and the matrix G1a protein or MGP. Gamma-carboxylation is catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylases. The reduced form of vitamin K, vitamin K hydroquinone, is the actual cofactor for the gamma-carboxylases.

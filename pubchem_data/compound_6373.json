They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

The effects of reactor temperature, electric power, initial concentration and oxygen content were examined. The DBD reactor was able to completely destroy CHF3 with alumina beads as a packing material. The decomposition efficiency increased with increasing electric power and reactor temperature. The destruction of CHF3 gradually increased with the addition of O2 up to 2%, but further increase in the oxygen content led to a decrease in the decomposition efficiency. The degradation pathways were explained with the identified by-products. The main by-products from CHF3 were found to be COF2, CF4, CO2 and CO although the COF2 and CF4 disappeared when the plasma were combined with alumina catalyst.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation. Dataset: the integrated content containing the transformation information. Source: the entity or group that compiled the dataset containing the transformation information.",

Both liquid-phase halogen exchange in the presence of catalysts, such as antimony(V) or tin(IV) chlorofluorides and vapor phase reactions using solid-phase catalysts based on chromium are employed. Preferred starting materials are chloroform for HFC 23, dichloromethane for HFC 32, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane for HFC 143a. The conversion of tetrachloroethylene to HFC 125 and trichloroethylene to HFC 134a involves initial HF-addition across the double bond followed by a series of chlorine-fluorine exchange reactions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as refrigerant, intermediate in organic synthesis, direct coolant for infrared detector cells, blowing agent for urethane foams, and component in etch gas for integrated circuits material. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Five normal healthy male volunteers were exposed to concentrations of FC-23 between 10% and 60% (randomly interleaved with exposures to both room air and 40% nitrous oxide) in a within-subjects, double-blind design. Analyses of individual cases and ranked group data showed that individuals tolerated the 30% concentration of FC-23. ANIMAL STUDIES: In cats, inhaled at 60%, trifluoromethane had no effect on cerebral blood flow, the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, or oxyhemoglobin content. At 70%, trifluoromethane sensitized the cats' hearts to epinephrine, but to a much lesser degree than 40% chlorodifluoromethane, and produced only moderate changes in cerebral electrical activity as measured by the electroencephalogram. In other study, the acute cardiac and central nervous system effects of trifluoromethane were evaluated in eight anesthetized baboons. A dose-response effect was established for respiratory rate, electroencephalogram, and cardiac sinus rate, which exhibited a stepwise decrease from 10% trifluoromethane. No spontaneous arrhythmias were noted, and arterial blood pressure remained unchanged at any inspired level. Intravenous epinephrine infusions induced transient cardiac arrhythmia in 1 animal only at 70% (v/v) trifluoromethane. Trifluoromethane appears to induce mild dose-related physiological changes at inspired levels of 30% or more, indicative of an anesthetic effect. It significantly increased mutation rates in progeny of Drosophila over control levels.",

In a Phase 1, dose ranging (investigative new drug) study, neuropsychological (NP) tests, subjective ratings, and intensive physiological monitoring were used to determine the maximum tolerated concentration of FC-23 for human application. Five normal healthy male volunteers were exposed to concentrations of FC-23 between 10% and 60% [randomly interleaved with exposures to both room air and 40% nitrous oxide (N2O)] in a within-subjects, double-blind design. Analyses of individual cases and ranked group data showed that individuals tolerated the 30% concentration of FC-23 according to established criteria. Planned comparisons indicated that inhalation of FC-23 produced smaller NP changes and fewer negative symptoms than 40% N2O but poorer NP performance and more negative symptoms than room air. This study indicated that FC-23 is not inert and that humans do not tolerate concentrations suitable for current MRI technology.",

Our earlier investigations with trifluoromethane (FC-23) gas have shown that this compound can be used to safely and effectively measure CBF in anesthetized animal models. In this Phase I dose-escalation study we set out to determine the maximal tolerated concentration (MTC) of FC-23 in normal healthy male volunteers and to assess its feasibility as an NMR indicator. Five subjects were exposed in a blinded fashion to escalating concentrations of FC-23 between 10% and 60%, randomly interleaved with exposures to both room air and 40% nitrous oxide. On each study day, the subjects breathed the test gas for eight pulses of 3 min each with 2-min clearance periods between the pulses. The subjects underwent intensive physiologic and neurobehavioral monitoring throughout the study period. The first subject experienced an anesthetic response to 60% FC-23, and the second subject experienced \"discomfort\" and requested discontinuation at the initiation of 40% FC-23. The MTC was subsequently determined to be 30% FC-23 (all subjects tolerated the gas), although a small (37.6 vs. 40.5) but statistically significant retention of carbon dioxide was found (p = .003). When one subject received 30% FC-23 during an NMR imaging study, a pronounced anesthetic effect with intolerable hyperacusis was demonstrated. Human studies of FC-23 have been discontinued in our laboratory.",

Freezing of airway soft tissues can probably be eliminated as a cause of death except in cases where the product was sprayed directly into the mouth from its container or from a balloon containing some liquid. Laryngeal spasm or edema, oxygen displacement, or sensitization of myocardium to endogenous catecholamines with subsequent ventricular fibrillation appear to be reasonable possibilities. /Fluorocarbon refrigerants & propellants/",

Inhaled at 60%, trifluoromethane had no effect on cerebral blood flow, the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, or oxyhemoglobin content. At 70%, trifluoromethane sensitized the cats' hearts [SRP: CARDIAC SENSITIZATION] to epinephrine, but to a much lesser degree than 40% chlorodifluoromethane, and produced only moderate changes in cerebral electrical activity as measured by the electroencephalogram.

Trifluoromethane may also have significant value as a replacement for chlorofluorocarbon fire retardants. Because of possible species-specific cardiotoxic and anesthetic properties, the toxicological evaluation of trifluoromethane in primates (Papio anubis) is necessary prior to its evaluation in humans. We report the acute cardiac and central nervous system effects of trifluoromethane in eight anesthetized baboons. A dose-response effect was established for respiratory rate, electroencephalogram, and cardiac sinus rate, which exhibited a stepwise decrease from 10% trifluoromethane. No spontaneous arrhythmias were noted, and arterial blood pressure remained unchanged at any inspired level. Intravenous epinephrine infusions (1 microgram/kg) induced transient cardiac arrhythmia in 1 animal only at 70% FC-23 (v/v) trifluoromethane. Trifluoromethane appears to induce mild dose-related physiological changes at inspired levels of 30% or more, indicative of an anesthetic effect. These data suggest that trifluoromethane may be safe to use in humans, without significant adverse acute effects, at an inspired level of 30%.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 35,300 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates trifluoromethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase trifluoromethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 140-160 years. This relatively slow half-life in the lower atmosphere suggests that some trifluoromethane may gradually diffuse into the stratosphere (estimated diffusion half-life of 20 years). Trifluoromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Trifluoromethane has 20-, 100- and 500-year Global Warming Potentials of 8200-15,486, 9200-19,691 and 9900-15,547, respectively. The atmospheric life-time for trifluoromethane has been calculated to be 234-295 years. If released to soil, trifluoromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 32. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0952 atm-cu m/mole. Trifluoromethane will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil and water is not expected based on aerobic pure culture studies. If released into water, trifluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 hours and 3.3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 5.1 years and 190 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, suggest that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process. Occupational exposure to trifluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where trifluoromethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to trifluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing trifluoromethane.

Gas-phase trifluoromethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 140-160 years(SRC), calculated from rate constants of 2.7X10-16 to 2.8X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3-5). Trifluoromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). This relatively slow half-life in the lower atmosphere suggests that some trifluoromethane may gradually diffuse into the stratosphere(SRC). The diffusion half-life for transport from the troposphere to the stratosphere is on the order of 20 years(7). Trifluoromethane has Global Warming Potentials of 8200-15,486 (20 Yr), 9200-19,691 (100 Yr) and 9900-15,547 (500 Yr(4, 8-11). The atmospheric life-time for trifluoromethane has been calculated to be 234-295 years(4, 8-11).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

When abused, inhaled DFE produces intoxication and loss of muscular coordination. To investigate DFE toxicokinetics, groups (n = 3) of Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 30 s of 20 L/min DFE. The experimental model was designed to mimic exposure during abuse, a protocol which has not been conducted. Tissue collection (blood, brain, heart, liver, and kidney) occurred at 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 240, 480, and 900 s. Average peak DFE levels were blood 352, brain 519, heart 338, liver 187, and kidney 364 mg/L or mg/kg. The total percent uptake of the administered dose was 4.0%. Uptake into individual compartments was 2.72, 0.38, 0.15, 0.41, and 0.32% for blood, brain, heart, liver, and kidney, respectively. All animals showed signs of intoxication within 20 s manifested as lethargy, prostration and loss of righting reflex. Marked intoxication continued for about 4 min when DFE averaged 21 mg/L in blood and 17 mg/kg in brain. Between 4 and 8 min, animals continued to show signs of sedation as evidenced by reduced aggression and excitement during handling. No discernable intoxication was evident after 8 min and blood and brain levels had fallen to 10 and 6 mg/L or kg, respectively. Plots of concentration (log) versus time were consistent with a two compartment model. Initial distribution was rapid with average half life (t((1/2))) during the alpha phase of 9 s for blood, 18 s for brain and 27 s in cardiac tissue. During beta slope elimination average t((1/2)) was 86 s in blood, 110 s in brain and 168 s in heart. Late elimination half lives were longer with blood gamma = 240 s, brain gamma = 340 s, and heart gamma = 231 s. Following acute exposure the Vd = 0.06 L, beta = 0.48 min(-1), AUC = 409.8 mg.min L(-1), and CL from blood was 0.03 L min(-1). The calculated toxicokinetic data may underestimate these parameters if DFE is abused chronically due to continued uptake into lowly perfused tissues with repeated dosing.",

Healthy volunteers were exposed to 0, 200 or 1000 ppm 1,1-difluoroethane for 2 hr at light exercise in an exposure chamber. Capillary blood, urine and exhaled air were sampled up to 22 hr post-exposure and analyzed for 1,1-difluoroethane. Fluoride and other potential metabolites were analyzed in urine. Symptoms of irritation and central nervous system effects were rated and inflammatory markers were analyzed in blood. Within a few minutes of exposure to 200 and 1000 ppm, 1,1-difluoroethane increased rapidly in blood and reached average levels of 7.4 and 34.3 uM, respectively. The post-exposure decreases in blood were fast and parallel to those in exhaled air. The observed time courses in blood and breath agreed well with those obtained with the PBPK model. The PBPK simulations indicate a net uptake during exposure to 1000 ppm of 6.6 mmol (6.7%) which corresponds to the amount exhaled post-exposure. About 20 umol excess fluoride (0.013% of inhaled 1,1-difluoroethane on a molar basis) was excreted in urine after exposure to 1000 ppm, compared to control. No fluorine-containing metabolites were detected in urine. Symptom ratings and changes in inflammatory markers revealed no exposure-related effects.",

Two calibration curves using 0.5 mL whole blood calibrators which ranged from A: 0.225-1.350 to B: 9.0-180.0 mg/L were developed. These were evaluated for linearity (0.9992 and 0.9995), limit of detection of 0.018 mg/L, limit of quantitation of 0.099 mg/L (recovery 111.9%, CV 9.92%), and upper limit of linearity of 27,000.0 mg/L. Combined curve recovery results of a 98.0 mg/L DFE control that was prepared using an alternate technique was 102.2% with CV of 3.09%. No matrix interference was observed in DFE enriched blood, urine or brain specimens nor did analysis of variance detect any significant differences (alpha = 0.01) in the area under the curve of blood, urine or brain specimens at three identical DFE concentrations. The method is suitable for use in forensic laboratories because validation was performed on instrumentation routinely used in forensic labs and due to the ease with which the calibration range can be adjusted. Perhaps more importantly it is also useful for research oriented studies because the removal of solvent from standard preparation eliminates the possibility for solvent induced changes to the gas/liquid partitioning of DFE or chromatographic interference due to the presence of solvent in specimens."

In the last five years, 17 cases from the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office showed the presence of 1,1-difluoroethane in postmortem tissues, and the gas was cited in the cause of death in 13 of those cases. Detected during routine ethanol screening,1,1-difluoroethane was evaluated for concentrations in peripheral blood, central blood and vitreous humor by a slightly modified method published by Avella et al. In many cases, death from abuse of 1,1-difluoroethane seemed to occur within minutes of intentional abuse; large concentrations (>100 mg/L) of the gas were still in the blood. It is important that forensic toxicology laboratories have routine screening procedures to detect 1,1-difluoroethane because cases exist in which evidence of use from cans may not be present in proximity to the decedent, or may be undiscovered in the debris of a motor vehicle accident. It is also important to quantify concentrations of 1,1-difluoroethane in both peripheral blood and central blood, whose ratio may be useful in interpreting how recently the use of the 1,1-difluoroethane occurred.",

The objective of this study was to examine the usefulness of blood and breath for exposure biomonitoring of HFCs. We compared data on blood and exhaled air from a series of experiments where healthy volunteers were exposed to vapors of four commonly used HFCs; 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-trifluoroethane, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane. All four HFCs had similar toxicokinetic profiles in blood with a rapid initial increase and an apparent steady-state reached within a few minutes. For all HFCs, the inhalation uptake during exposure was low (less than 6%), most of which was exhaled post-exposure. No metabolism could be detected and only minor amounts were excreted unchanged in urine. The observed time courses in blood and breath were well described by physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. Simulations of 8-hr exposures show that the HFC levels in both blood and breath drop rapidly during the first minutes post-exposure, whereafter the decline is considerably slower and mainly reflects washout from fat tissues. We conclude that blood and exhaled air can be used for biological exposure monitoring. Samples should not be taken immediately at the end of shift but rather 20-30 min later.",

Toxic by inhalation and dermal contact, exposure to this colorless, odorless gas may occur from its use as a refrigerant, aerosol propellant, and intermediate. Effects from exposure may include light-headedness, irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, frostbite, pulmonary edema, palpitations, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death. In activities where overexposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and personal protective clothing. Freon 152A is extremely flammable and may be ignited by heat, sparks, or flames in a wide range of concentrations (flammable limits: 3.7%-18%. Freon 152A is an explosion hazard in confined spaces such as sewers, and its heavier than air vapor may travel to a source of ignition and flash back. Also, containers (cyllinders) of freon 152A may explode in the heat of a fire, and the burning substance may produce irritating or poisonous fumes such as hydrogen fluoride or phosgene. For fires involving freon 152A, consider evacuation for a 1/2 mile radius. Let tank cars, tank trucks or storage tanks burn unless the leak can be stopped. For smaller fires, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray or fog. For massive fires, use unmanned hose holders. Shipment of freon 152A is forbidden on passenger carrying aircraft and railcars. Any shippment of freon 152A should be done in containers bearing the label, \"Flammable gas\", and storage should be in areas away from sparks, flames, or other sources of ignition. Should a leak occur, isolate the area, use water spray to kock down vapor, and attempt to stop the leak if possible without undue personal risk. Do not allow the material to enter water sources or sewers. Before implementing land disposal of waste freon 152A, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

All equipment used when handling the product must be grounded. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Stop leak if you can do it without risk. If possible, turn leaking containers so that gas escapes rather than liquid. Use water spray to reduce vapors or divert vapor cloud drift. Avoid allowing water runoff to contact spilled material. Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Also, they are incompatible with many amines, nitrides, azo/diazo compounds, alkali metals, and epoxides. The reaction of aluminum with various halogenated hydrocarbons produces a self-sustaining reaction with sufficient heat to melt aluminum pieces, examples of other halogenated hydrocarbons are fluorotrichloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, chlorodifluoromethane, tetrafluoromethane.

The primary uses for HFC-152a are as an aerosol propellant and a foam expansion agent. Other potential uses include refrigeration blends and catalyst regeneration. Intermediate to vinyl fluoride. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Several volunteers were exposed to 500,000 ppm of HFC 152a for several min. Analgesia and an impending loss of consciousness were reported. Rapid evaporation of the liquid may cause frostbite. The substance may cause effects on the cardiovascular system , resulting in cardiac disorders. Abuse of fluorinated hydrocarbons is on the rise, especially among the adolescent population. Inhaling aerosolized computer-cleaning spray composed of HFC-152a led to marked upper and lower lip facial swelling consistent with angioedema. The patient also had a prolonged QT interval, mild inspiratory stridor, but no urticaria. In other case, acute myocardial injury and global hypokinesis along with rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and fulminant hepatitis developed after 2 days of nearly continuous huffing. A serious but rarely reported complication of halogenated hydrocarbon inhalation abuse is severe mucosal frostbite. HFC-152a showed evidence of weak clastogenicity in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test.  ANIMAL STUDIES: HFC-152a has low acute inhalation toxicity. The repeat dose studies show some potential for irritation. HFC-152a has the potential to produce cardiac sensitization in dogs challenged simultaneously with high exposure concentrations and high doses of exogenous epinephrine. HFC-152a had anesthetic properties at a 100,000 ppm exposure level during a 2-week repeated dose inhalation study in rats. No adverse effects were observed in rats following a 3-month inhalation exposure to 25,000 ppm HFC-152a. In a developmental study, female rats were exposed via inhalation up to 50,000 ppm during days 6 to 15 of pregnancy for 6 hours per day. No compound related maternal and developmental effects were observed at any of the concentrations tested. No histopathological or weight effects on reproductive organs were observed in male and female rats exposed up to 25,000 ppm HFC-152a for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 3, 12 or 24 months. . In a 2-year bioassay, HFC-152a was not carcinogenic to rats at inhalation exposure levels up to 25,000 ppm. HFC-152a was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test) in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli strains. An in vivo rat Micronucleus Test did not show any evidence of chromosome damage or bone marrow cell toxicity when administered by whole body inhalation.",

There are three recognized etiologies of HO: traumatic, neurogenic, and genetic. Presently, there are no definitively documented causal factors of HO. The following factors are presumed to place a patient at higher risk: 60 years of age or older, male, previous HO, hypertrophic osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, prior hip surgery, and surgical risk factors. A 33-year-old male, involved in a motor vehicle crash, sustained an irreducible acetabulum fracture/dislocation, displaced proximal humerus fracture, and an impacted pilon fracture. During the time of injury, he was intoxicated from inhaling the aerosol propellant used in \"dust spray\" cans (1,1-difluoroethane, C2H4F2). Radiographs identified rapid pathologic bone formation about the proximal humeral metaphysis, proximal femur, elbow, and soft tissue several months following the initial injury. The patient did not have any genetic disorders that could have attributed to the bone formation but had some risk factors (male, fracture with dislocation). Surgically, the recommended precautions were followed to decrease the chance of HO. Although the patient did not have neurogenic injuries, the difluoroethane in dusting spray can cause damage to the central nervous system. Signals may have been mixed causing the patient's body to produce bone instead of tissue to strengthen the injured area. What is unusual in this case is the rate at which the pathological bone formation appeared, which was long outside the 4-6 week window in which HO starts to appear. The authors are not certain as to the cause of this rapid formation but suspect that the patient's continued abuse of inhaled aerosol propellants may be the culprit.",

Its use as a foaming agent and aerosol propellant will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4550 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,1-difluoroethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 1,1-difluoroethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 190-270 days. 1,1-Difluoroethane has reported 20- and 100-Year Global Warming Potentials of 3.3 and 0.9, respectively. 1,1-Difluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,1-difluoroethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 32. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0203 atm-cu m/mole. 1,1-Difluoroethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, 1,1-difluoroethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1,1-difluoroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,1-difluoroethane is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is  expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.0203 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.2 days, respectively(SRC). 1,1-Difluoroethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.75(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2016).",

Gas-phase 1,1-difluoroethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 190-270 days(SRC), calculated from rate constants of 2.54X10-14 to 3.6X10-14 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3-5). 1,1-Difluoroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(6) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). 1,1-Difluoroethane's atmospheric life-time has been calculated as 1.5 years with a degradation product of carbonic difluoride(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

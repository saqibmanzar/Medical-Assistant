When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The mechanism of action of the drugs in lowering intraocular pressure has not been precisely determined. In patients with open-angle (chronic simple, noncongestive) glaucoma, the drugs facilitate aqueous humor outflow, apparently by causing contraction of the ciliary muscle and widening of the trabecular meshwork. ... Miotics decrease activity of extraocular muscles of convergence. ... Systemically absorbed miotics produce parasympathomimetic effects on various body systems. /Miotics/"

The sample was freeze-dried to a powder which was first mixed with acetamide, the internal standard, and then dissolved in MeOH. An aliquot of the soln was evaporated to dryness, the residue dissolved in D2O, the soln mixed with the reference standard, and the spectrum recorded. The quantity of carbachol in the dosage form was calculated from the integral value at approx 3.27 ppm (carbachol) and approx 2.01 ppm (acetamide). The mean recovery value for carbachol added to synthetic formulations was 100.0%.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

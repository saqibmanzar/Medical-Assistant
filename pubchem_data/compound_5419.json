Available since the 1950s, tetryzoline is a selective \u03b11-receptor agonist that is used as an ocular and nasal decongestant. Tetryzoline is found in a wide array of over-the-counter eye drops, including the most common brand, Visine. Tetryzoline is also found in combination products with other lubricants and anti-irritants, such as [povidone], [polyethylene glycol 400], [dextran], and [zinc sulfate]. It is also used in combination with other drug classes, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids, and glucocorticoids in other countries. Tetryzoline is also found in nasal spray under the trade name Tyzine, which is used for decongestion of nasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa.  As it causes profound sedation in children and adults, tetryzoline is increasingly becoming scrutinized for possible drug overdose and toxicity from accidental ingestion. It has also been misused for non-therapeutic purposes as a causative drug for several cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

We report three cases that presented with CNS depression and cardiovascular effects where serum concentrations were performed.  CASE REPORT: Case 1 ingested an unknown amount of eye drops containing THZ, resulting in altered mental status, bradycardia, hypothermia, and hypotension. Cases 2 and 3 ingested 7.5 mL of eye drops containing THZ. Case 2 presented to the emergency department (ED) without symptoms but became lethargic and bradycardic 90 min after ingestion. By contrast, Case 3 became lethargic 15 min after ingestion and required intubation on arrival to the ED. All children were admitted to ICU for observation and improved within 24 hr of ingestion. Urine obtained for drug screening was positive for THZ. Blood was obtained to assess level using gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS).  CASE DISCUSSION: Case 1 had plasma levels of 51.4 and 23.6 ng/mL at 7 and 12 hr, respectively, after ingestion, revealing a half-life of 4.4 hr. Numerous case reports have been published documenting the dangers of ingesting these topical over-the-counter (OTC) products. However, human PK data are not available to help in our understanding of THZ toxicokinetics and disposition in humans after ingestion.  CONCLUSION: We report three pediatric cases after ingestion of THZ where plasma concentrations were obtained with a calculated half-life of 4.4 hr in one case.",

The primary aim of this investigation was to establish baseline therapeutic serum and urine concentrations in a sample of healthy volunteers.  METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers consented to have two drops of Original Visine eye drops (0.05% tetrahydrozoline solution) placed directly into the conjunctival sac of each eye, 30 seconds apart, at times 0, 4, 8, and 12 hr. Blood and urine samples were then collected at 2, 5, 9, 13, and 24 hr post-application and analyzed for concentrations. Tetrahydrozoline concentrations are described using measures of central tendency and dispersion at each time point, with predictions of serum and urine concentrations over time calculated using a linear mixed effects regression model.  RESULTS: Tetrahydrazoline concentrations were detectable in both serum and urine after therapeutic ocular administration. The mean serum half-life of tetrahydrozoline was approximately 6 hr. Systemic absorption varied among subjects, with the maximum serum concentrations ranging from 0.068 to 0.380 ng/mL. At 24 hr, all patients had detectable urine concentrations of tetrahydrozoline (range = 13-210 ng/mL).  CONCLUSION: When used as directed by the manufacturer for therapeutic ocular administration, tetrahydrozoline concentrations were detectable in both serum and urine up to 12 hr after the last administered dose. A concentration greatly exceeding the 95% confidence interval of drug present during therapeutic ocular use may be suggestive of illegal adulterant use or accidental or suicidal overdose.",

Ocular decongestants are ineffective in the treatment of delayed hypersensitivity reactions such as contact dermatoconjunctivitis. The vasoconstrictor effect of tetrahydrozoline may be used during some ocular diagnostic procedures, but some clinicians prefer phenylephrine to tetrahydrozoline for this use. HUMAN STUDIES: Serious adverse events requiring hospitalization have been reported in pediatric patients following accidental ingestion of nonprescription ophthalmic solutions or nasal sprays containing imidazoline derivatives including tetrahydrozoline. Between 1985 and October 2012, 96 cases of accidental ingestion were reported in children 1 month to 5 years of age. The amount of drug ingested ranged from 0.6-45 mL. While no deaths were reported, more than half of these cases reported serious adverse events requiring hospitalization, including nausea, vomiting, lethargy, tachycardia, decreased respiration, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, sedation, somnolence, mydriasis, stupor, hypothermia, drooling, and coma. ANIMAL STUDIES: In dogs, signs of intoxication may include vomiting, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, poor capillary refill time, hypotension or hypertension, panting, increased upper respiratory sounds, depression, weakness, nervousness, hyperactivity, or shaking. These signs appear within 30 min to 4 hr postexposure. In general, imidazoline decongestant exposure may affect the GI, cardiopulmonary, and nervous systems.",

In each tetrahydrozoline (THZ) was quantified.  CASE REPORT: Case #1 ingested an unknown amount of eye drops containing THZ mixed with alcoholic beverages. Case #1 presented to the emergency department (ED) approximately 7 hr after reportedly being sexually assaulted and was without symptoms in the ED. Earlier reports from individuals who saw her indicated the victim to be \"heavily intoxicated\". Case #2 also ingested an unknown amount of eye drops containing THZ mixed with alcoholic beverages. Case #2 presented to an ED without symptoms approximately 23 hr after reportedly being sexually assaulted. Urine obtained from both cases was assessed for THZ concentrations using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry.  CASE DISCUSSION: Case #1 had a 0.15 g% (by weight by volume) urine ethanol concentration and a urinary THZ concentration of 1.481 ng/mL, approximately 7h after ingestion. Case #2 was negative for ethanol but had a urine THZ concentration of 108 ng/mL at 23 hr post-ingestion. Few case reports have been published documenting the use of THZ to facilitate sexual assault.  CONCLUSION: We report two cases of drug-facilitated sexual assault involving the use of THZ where alcoholic beverages were concomitantly consumed. This is the first paper to our knowledge which discusses pharmacology of THZ ingestion and the significance of alcohol being present.",

The study was carried out using a single dose of the tested drug, instilling 2 drops in one eye and 2 drops of a placebo in the other. The papillary diameters were measured by photographic pupillography under basal conditions and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after each treatment. Near and distance visual acuity and tonometry were evaluated under basal conditions and 50 and 95 min after instillation of drugs. No statistical significant differences between the treated and the control pupil diameters were found after instillation of 0.1% tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride or 0.3% chlorpheniramine maleate. The combination of 0.05% tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride with 0.3% pheniramine maleate caused a significant mydriasis from 30 min up to 120 min (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0005) after instillation, more pronounced in light irides. No local and systemic effects and no effects on visual acuity and ocular pressure were detected. On the basis of our results, it is possible to conclude that the persistent mydriatric action of the two-drug combination is due to a synergism; the use of these eyedrops should be avoided in subjects with narrow-angle glaucoma, light irides, narrow iridocorneal angle, and low anterior chamber for the risk of ocular pressure increase.",

Most pharmacologists believe that the drug directly stimulates a-adrenergic receptors of the sympathetic nervous system and exerts little or no effect on beta-adrenergic receptors. Following topical application of tetrahydrozoline to the conjunctiva, small arterioles are constricted and conjunctival congestion is temporarily relieved, but reactive hyperemia may occur. The drug also may produce mydriasis when applied to the conjunctiva, but this effect is usually minimal with the concentrations used as ocular decongestants.",

METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 72 patients with age between 2 months and 13 years (median 2 years; 25-75% = 1 to 3 years old) exposed to naphazoline (N = 48), fenoxazoline (N = 18), oxymetazoline (N = 5) and tetrahydrozoline (N = 1), through oral (N = 46), nasal (N = 24) or unknown (N = 2) routes.  RESULTS: Fifty-seven children developed clinical manifestations such as somnolence (N = 34/57), sweating (N = 20/57), pallor (N = 17/57), hypothermia (N = 16/57), bradycardia (N = 13/57), cool extremities (N = 9/57), restlessness (N = 7/57), tachycardia (N = 6/57), vomiting (N = 5/57), irregular respiratory pattern and apnea (N = 5/57), miosis/mydriasis (N = 4/57). Naphazoline was the active ingredient most frequently involved (N = 47), followed by fenoxazoline (N = 5) and oxymetazoline (N = 4). The onset of clinical manifestations was rapid, beginning within 2 hours after exposure in 32/57 children. Only supportive measures were employed, with one child requiring mechanical ventilation after accidental naphazoline ingestion. In most of the children resolution of symptoms occurred within 24 hours (N = 39/57). No deaths were observed. Patients exposed to naphazoline (N = 47/48) presented a higher frequency of clinical signs of poisoning in comparison with those exposed to fenoxazoline (N = 5/18) (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the frequency of patients who presented clinical manifestations considering the route of exposure [oral (N = 34/46), nasal (N = 21/24); p = 0.31].  CONCLUSIONS: Most children (especially those younger than 3 years) exposed to imidazoline derivatives (especially naphazoline) presented early signs of poisoning regardless of the exposure route (nasal or oral). The main signs observed were nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory depression. Most children showed complete resolution of the symptoms within 24 hours.",

Between 1985 and October 2012, 96 cases of accidental ingestion were reported in children 1 month to 5 years of age; the amount of drug ingested ranged from 0.6-45 mL. While no deaths were reported, more than half of these cases reported serious adverse events requiring hospitalization, including nausea, vomiting, lethargy, tachycardia, decreased respiration, bradycardia, hypotension, hypertension, sedation, somnolence, mydriasis, stupor, hypothermia, drooling, and coma.",

At 30 degrees C neither tolazoline nor tetrahydrozoline released histamine. However, both increased heart rate, contractility, and decreased coronary vascular resistance as a function of dose. The H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine and tiotidine blocked the effects of tolazoline and tetrahydrozoline. The actions of tetrahydrozoline were confined to its 1-isomer. At 37 degrees C tolazoline, but not tetrahydrozoline, released histamine into the coronary perfusate. The maximum tolazoline-induced change in heart rate was 2.5-3.0 times greater than tetrahydrozoline's, in distinct contrast to their identical effect at 30 degrees C. All other responses to the two drugs were the same at 30 and 37 degrees C. Our results suggest that tolazoline and tetrahydrozoline directly stimulate histamine H2-receptors. Because of the differences in the structures of imidazolines and histamine, these findings have implications for the current hypothesis regarding histamine H2-receptor activation.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

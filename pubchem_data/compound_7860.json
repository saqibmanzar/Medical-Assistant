Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Glyoxal reacts non-enzymatically with GSH with formation of a hemithioacetal, which is subsequently converted to S-glycolylglutathione by glyoxalase I. Glyoxalase II catalyses the hydrolysis of S-glycolylglutathione to glycolate, re-forming the GSH from the first reaction. The activity of glyoxalase I in situ is approximately proportional to the cytosolic concentration of GSH. When GSH is severely depleted (eg, under conditions of oxidative stress), however, 2-oxoaldehyde dehydrogenase and aldose reductase may also metabolize glyoxal. Imbalances in intracellular redox systems may impair these detoxification mechanisms, resulting in higher levels of glyoxal. A further GSH-independent route of detoxification via glyoxalase III exists.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

A sequence of non-enzymatic reactions, called glycation, yields stable advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) with a background extent of 0.1-1% of lysine and arginine residues in proteins and 1 in 1.0 X 10-7 nucleotides in DNA. ... Glyoxal forms stable adducts with guanosine by reaction with the N-1 as well as with the exocyclic nitrogen of guanine. The rate of glyoxal-guanine adduct formation is rapid under physiological conditions. A stable tricyclic glyoxal-DNA adduct is formed by covalent binding to two nitrogens of guanine under physiological conditions in vitro. Besides 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine, the glyoxal-deoxyguanosine (dG) adduct is one of the major deoxyguanosine oxidation products, being formed by oxygen radicals, lipid peroxidation systems, various types of oxidative stress, and UV irradiation and after in vivo exposure to beta-hydroxy-substituted N-nitrosamines.",

AGE modification alters protein function and inactivates enzymes, resulting in disturbance of cellular metabolism, impaired proteolysis, and inhibition of cell proliferation and protein synthesis.

Consequently, AGEs are especially associated with long-lived proteins, such as collagens, lens crystallins, and neurofilaments, but also have been identified in shorter-lived proteins, including hemoglobin, plasma proteins, lipoproteins, and intracellular proteins.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

This chemical is used as a chemical intermediate in the production of pharmaceuticals and dyestuffs, as a cross-linking agent in the production of polymers, as a biocide, and as a disinfecting agent. Due to microbial activity as well as non-enzymatic autoxidation of oil or browning reactions of saccharides, glyoxal is frequently detected in fermented food and beverages. It is found in beer, wine and tea. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The main routes of occupational exposure to glyoxal during use as a disinfectant are via inhalation and dermal absorption. The general population is exposed mainly through ingestion of glyoxal containing food, but could be exposed through polluted air in urban areas and traces of glyoxal found in drinking water. Glyoxal is endogenously produced during normal cellular metabolism by a multitude of enzyme independent pathways. Glyoxal is found in human blood and individuals with diabetes or renal failure have higher concentrations. Glyoxal is irritating to mucous membranes and acts as a skin sensitizing agent. ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: The acute toxicity of glyoxal in experimental animals is low to moderate, depending upon the concentration of the chemical. After inhalation exposure, local irritations of the eyes and respiratory tract as well as hyperemia and foamy secretion in the lungs predominate. After oral exposure to glyoxal, macroscopic observations include irritations to the gastrointestinal tract and congestion in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, kidney and adrenal glands. In the prominent target organs, pancreas and kidney, the toxic action of glyoxal leads to severe degenerative changes resembling those induced during diabetes. A 28 day study at high dosages of glyoxal administered to rats effects included reduced water and food intake and retardation of body weight gain. A 90 day feeding study in dogs failed to reveal any treatment related effects. Glyoxal is irritating to mucous membranes and acts as a sensitizing agent in experimental animals. Fetotoxic effects occurred only with doses of glyoxal that induced maternal toxicity. Glyoxal is directly genotoxic in vitro in bacterial and mammalian cells inducing DNA adducts, mutations, chromosomal aberrations, DNA repair, sister chromatid exchanges and DNA single strand breaks. In vivo, a genotoxic activity of glyoxal was established at the site of application in the pyloric mucosa of rats by demonstration of unscheduled DNA synthesis  and DNA simple strand breaks were further observed in the rat liver. Glyoxal showed tumor promoting activity in a two stage glandular stomach carcinogenesis study in male Wistar rats, where it was inactive in a short-term liver foci assay. In an assay for tumor initiating activity of glyoxal in skin and in cell transformation assays, glyoxal yielded negative results. Exposure to glyoxal has shown to inhibit activities of aerobic and anerobic bacteria , green algae and invertebrates.",

Glyoxal is also released to the environment from the combustion of wood, automobile exhaust, and the atmospheric degradation of aromatic and olefinic hydrocarbons. It may also be produced as a disinfection byproduct during the treatment of drinking water. Glyoxal is also endogenously produced by a variety of enzyme-independent pathways. If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 255 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates glyoxal will exist solely in the vapor-phase. Vapor-phase glyoxal is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 34 hours. Glyoxal also undergoes direct photolysis, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 5 hours. If released to soil, glyoxal is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.33X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of glyoxal from dry soil surfaces may exist based upon the extrapolated vapor pressure of this compound. Screening studies using sewage seed have indicated that glyoxal is readily biodegradable. If released into water, glyoxal is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Photolysis in sunlit surface waters is expected to be an important fate process because glyoxal absorbs light greater than 290 nm and undergoes direct photolysis in the atmosphere. Glyoxal is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to glyoxal may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. The general population is exposed to glyoxal via dermal exposure from permanent press fabrics, through the inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food, and the ingestion of drinking water where it may be produced as a disinfection byproduct(SRC).

According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.66(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Glyoxal undergoes direct photolysis with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 5 hours(8), suggesting that photolysis in sunlit surface waters may be an important environmental fate process(SRC). Glyoxal is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups.

Vapor-phase glyoxal is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 34 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.14X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Glyoxal also undergoes direct photolysis in the environment, with an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 5 hours(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Highest levels were observed during mid afternoon of a two day smog episode, indicating photochemical formation of glyoxal from other hydrocarbons(2). Glyoxal was detected at levels of 0.20 and 0.41 ug/cu m in the ambient air of a city residential site and city street site in Berlin, Germany, respectively(3). Glyoxal was detected in aerosol samples from Tokyo, Japan in 1992 at levels ranging from 0.038-0.046 ug/cu m(4).

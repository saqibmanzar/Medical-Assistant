ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

N-butyronitrile, propionitrile, and their respective alpha-C-hydroxylated homologs, propionaldehyde cyanohydrin and lactonitrile, were used to examine this question in mice. Pretreatment of mice with the hepatic microsomal enzyme inducers, pregnenolone-16-alpha-carbonitrile, troleandomycin, and isosafrole, or with the cytochrome p450-depleting agent, cobaltous chloride, did not influence the mortality of mice given a single dose of nitriles. Repeated injections of aspirin or sodium salicylate in water failed to protect mice against death by the nitriles. ... The cyanohydrins were more acutely toxic than their parent nitriles, produced death more rapidly, and resulted in the same toxic signs, suggesting that they are intermediates in the bioactivation pathway leading to free cyanide ions.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate) may be followed by respiratory depression. Lung hemorrhage and pulmonary edema may also occur. Headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, and giddiness may be followed by combative behavior, convulsions, paralysis, protruding eyeballs, dilated and unreactive pupils, and coma. Propionitrile is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common. Excessive salivation, nausea, and vomiting may also occur.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

Log(1/LD50-carbon tetrachloride)= -0.371 log p -0.152, and the equation was significant, provided aceto- and 3-hydroxypropionitrile were omitted from the analysis.

The hepatic microsomal metabolizing activity for nitrile was at a maximum 13 hr after ethanol dosing (4.0 g/kg). Using microsomes from mice pretreated with ethanol under the above conditions, enhancement of the in vitro metabolism of nitriles was 1.00-1.83 compared with the glucose-treated control. When mice were orally given nitriles 13 hr after dosing with either ethanol (4.0 g/kg) or glucose (7.0 g/kg), the hepatic metabolizing activity of nitriles for the ethanol-treated group was always higher than that for the glucose group, although no change in the content of hepatic microsomal p450 was observed between the two groups. However, ethanol added to the induction mixture inhibited the in vitro metabolism of most nitriles. The results in the present study suggest that pretreatment with ethanol can enhance the acute toxicity of nitriles.",

Massive cyanide overdoses have survived with only good supportive care. Immediate attention should be directed toward assisted ventilation, administration of 100% oxygen, insertion of intravenous lines, and institution of cardiac monitoring. Obtain an arterial blood gas immediately and correct any severe metabolic acidosis (pH below 7.15). Oxygen (100%) should be used routinely in moderate or severely symptomatic patients even in the presence of a normal pO2, since 100% O2 increases O2 delivery, may reactivate cyanide-inhibited mitochondrial enzymes, and potentiates the effect of thiosulfate. /Cyanides/",

Anxiety, confusion, vertigo, giddiness, & often a sensation of stiffness in the lower jaw. 4. Hyperpnea & dyspnea. Respirations become very rapid & then slow & irregular. Inspiration is characteristically short while expiration is greatly prolonged. 5. The odor of bitter almonds may be noted on the breath or vomitus ... 6. In the early phases of poisoning, an incr in vasoconstrictor tone causes a rise in blood pressure & reflex slowing of the heart rate. Thereafter the pulse becomes rapid, weak, & sometimes irregular ... . A bright pink coloration of the skin due to high concn of oxyhemoglobin in the venous return may be confused with that of carbon monoxide poisoning. 7. Unconsciousness, followed promptly by violent convulsions, epileptiform or tonic, sometimes localized but usually generalized. Opisthotonos & trismus may develop. Involuntary micturition & defecation occur. 8. Paralysis follows the convulsive stage. The skin is covered with sweat. The eyeballs protrude, & the pupils are dilated & unreactive. The mouth is covered with foam, which is sometimes bloodstained ... . The skin color may be brick red. Cyanosis is not prominent in spite of weak & irregular gasping. In the unconscious patient, bradycardia & the absence of cyanosis may be key diagnostic signs. 9. Death from respiratory arrest. As long as the heart beat continues, prompt & vigorous treatment offers some promise of survival. /Cyanide/",

Surface pH was measured by advancing pH-sensitive microelectrodes from the luminal solution to the epithelial cell surface. ... By delayed (5 hr) actions, both cysteamine and propionitrile inhibited the rise in alkali secretion in response to a 5 minute exposure to luminal acid with pH 2.00 in the rat. ... Inhibition of mechanisms mediating this response may contribute to the duodenal ulcerogenic actions of cysteamine and propionitrile.",

Propionitrile is also present in the product of modern hydrogen cyanide manufacturing facilities and is an organic impurity in acrylonitrile manufacturing which may result in its release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 47.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates propionitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase propionitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 83 days. If released to soil, propionitrile is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 29. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.70X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Propionitrile may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, propionitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Propionitrile is expected to biodegrade in the environment; microorganisms hydrolyze nitriles, such as propionitrile, predominately to carboxylic acids plus ammonium ions. For example, a mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides, biodegraded propionitrile. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hours and 8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to propionitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where propionitrile is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to propionitrile via inhalation of ambient air containing propionitrile. (SRC)",

Volatilization of propionitrile from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 3.70X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). The potential for volatilization of propionitrile from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 47.4 mm Hg(5). Microorganisms hydrolyze nitriles predominately to carboxylic acids plus ammonium ions(6,7). A mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides and PCBs, utilized propionitrile as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen(8).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.70x10-5 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 hrs and 8 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Microorganisms hydrolyze nitriles predominately to carboxylic acids plus ammonium ions(7,8). A variant of a yeast strain (Candiada famata) isolated from gold mine effluent was able to grow on propionitrile as the sole nitrogen source after acclimatization(9). In another study, a mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides and PCBs, utilized propionitrile as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen(10). The mixed microbial culture was grown for 48 hrs at pH 7 with 1 g/l of propionitrile; the final pH and ammonia concn were determined to be 8.66 and 75.9 umol/ml, respectively(10). Propionitrile was rapidly metabolized by activated sewage sludge to the amide(11).",

A variant of a yeast strain identified as Candiada famata isolated from gold mine effluent was able to grow on propionitrile as the sole nitrogen source after acclimatization(3). In another study, a mixed microbial culture, isolated from an environment contaminated with organic cyanides and PCBs, utilized propionitrile as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen(4). The mixed microbial culture was grown for 48 hrs at pH 7 with 1 g/l of propionitrile; the final pH and ammonia concn were determined to be 8.66 and 76.9 umol/ml, respectively(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

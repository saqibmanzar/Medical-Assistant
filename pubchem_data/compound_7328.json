When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

A clinical picture in which most or all of the following signs or symptoms are present: headache, blurred vision, weakness, tightness in chest, and constricted pupils. 4. Reduction of plasma and RBC cholinesterase activity to a level substantially below 50% of baseline values.

The others had recurring crises, each of which responded to treatment. The fifth patient apparently became worse more gradually, but for many days she had a recurrence of cramps and difficulty secondary to profuse bronchial secretions whenever her atropine therapy was reduced; it finally was tapered off and discontinued 45 days after ingestion. The surviving patients received total doses of only 84, 659.6, and 33 mg of atropine sulfate and only 2, 1, and 5 gm of pralidoxime chloride. ... Poisoning by dichlofenthion was characterized by relatively mild but prolonged illness in those who survived.",

If released to the atmosphere, dichlofenthion will exist in both vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 5.6X10-4 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase dichlofenthion is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 4 hours. Particulate phase dichlofention may be physically removed from air by dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 15,000 suggests that dichlofenthion will be immobile in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mol, but not from dry soil surfaces based on a measured vapor pressure. Dichlofenthion is expected to adsorb to suspended matter in water based on its Koc value. This compound should volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hours and 8 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 4700 suggests that dichlofenthion will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms.

Dichlofenthion may volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure(3) and water solubility(4). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hours and 8 days, respectively(1,SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

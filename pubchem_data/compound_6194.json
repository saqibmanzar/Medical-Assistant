Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Exposure to this odorless, off-white, crystalline powder may occur from its manufacture, formulation, or distribution for use as an antineoplastic drug. Effects from exposure may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dermatitis, irritability, depression, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Uracil mustard has been indicated as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Exposure should be controlled by mechanical ventilation with high-efficiency particulate arrestors (HEPA) or charcoal filters to minimize the amount of the substance in exhausted air. In activities and situations whereover-exposure may occur, wear protective clothing and a carefully fitted respirator. If exposure should occur, immediately irrigate affected eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash affected skin thoroughly with soap and water. Contaminated clothing should be removed and discarded or left at the work site for cleaning before reuse. Smoking, eating, and drinking should be prohibited in uracil mustard work areas. Uracil mustard should be stored and transported in air-tight glass bottles or ampoules which are, in turn, placed inside strong screw-cap or snap-top containers. Spills of uracil mustard should be taken up with a wet mop or vacuum cleaner equipped with a high efficiency particulate filter on the exhaust. Do not sweep, brush, or use any other method which may disperse the substance.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

If released to soil, uracil mustard should have high mobility. Volatilization of uracil mustard should not be important from moist or dry soil surfaces. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of uracil mustard in soil or water. If released to water, uracil mustard would not adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Uracil mustard will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces. An estimated BCF value of 1.8 suggests that uracil mustard will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Uracil mustard will be rapidly hydrolyzed in water and moist soil with experimental neutral and base-catalyzed hydrolysis rates in water at 25 \u00b0C of 0.57/hour and 2.05/hour, respectively, which correspond to a calculated half-life of 1.2 hours at a pH of 7. If released to the atmosphere, uracil mustard will exist almost entirely in the particulate phase. Vapor-phase uracil mustard is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 19 hours. Vapor-phase uracil mustard is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with atmospheric ozone with an estimated half-life of about 6.5 days. Particulate-phase uracil mustard may be physically removed from the air by wet deposition. Direct human exposure may occur through ingestion of the drug when dispensed in capsule form. Workers involved in formulating and dispensing the drug may be exposed through dermal contact or inhalation of dust. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase uracil mustard is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 19 hours(3,SRC). Vapor-phase uracil mustard is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with atmospheric ozone(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 6.5 days(3,SRC). Particulate-phase uracil mustard may be physically removed from the air by wet deposition(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 19 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1,SRC). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of uracil mustard with atmospheric ozone has been estimated as 1.7X10-18 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) using a structure estimation method(1,SRC). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1,SRC). Uracil mustard has experiment neutral and base-catalyzed hydrolysis rates in water at 25 \u00b0C of 0.57/hour and 2.05/hour, respectively, which correspond to a calculated half-life of 1.2 hours at a pH of 7(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

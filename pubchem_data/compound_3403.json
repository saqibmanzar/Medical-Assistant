This agent lowers plasma cholesterol and lipoprotein levels, and modulates immune responses through the suppression of MHC II (major histocompatibility complex II) on interferon gamma-stimulated antigen-presenting cells such as human vascular endothelial cells. Due to its anti-inflammatory effects mediated by alterations of lipid metabolism, fluvastatin may possess chemopreventive and therapeutic antineoplastic properties.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, fluvastatin capsules should be discontinued and the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Administration of a high fat meal delayed the absorption (Tmax: 6 hr) and increased the bioavailability of the extended-release tablet by approximately 50%.

Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LOX-1), the primary receptor for ox-LDL, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorders. We have recently shown that chronic exposure of cells to lovastatin disrupts LOX-1 receptor cluster distribution in plasma membranes, leading to a marked loss of LOX-1 function. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of statin-mediated LOX-1 inhibition and we demonstrate that all tested statins /including fluvastatin/ are able to displace the binding of fluorescent ox-LDL to LOX-1 by a direct interaction with LOX-1 receptors in a cell-based binding assay. Molecular docking simulations confirm the interaction and indicate that statins completely fill the hydrophobic tunnel that crosses the C-type lectin-like (CTLD) recognition domain of LOX-1. Classical molecular dynamics simulation technique applied to the LOX-1 CTLD, considered in the entire receptor structure with or without a statin ligand inside the tunnel, indicates that the presence of a ligand largely increases the dimer stability. Electrophoretic separation and western blot confirm that different statins binding stabilize the dimer assembly of LOX-1 receptors in vivo. The simulative and experimental results allow us to propose a CTLD clamp motion, which enables the receptor-substrate coupling. These findings reveal a novel and significant functional effect of statins.",

Although one possible explanation is through an effect on beta-amyloid (Abeta) metabolism, its effect remains to be elucidated. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of how statins influence Abeta metabolism. Fluvastatin at clinical doses significantly reduced Abeta and amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) levels among APP metabolites in the brain of C57BL/6 mice. Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of lysosomal inhibitors blocked these effects, indicating that up-regulation of the lysosomal degradation of endogenous APP-CTFs is involved in reduced Abeta production. Biochemical analysis suggested that this was mediated by enhanced trafficking of APP-CTFs from endosomes to lysosomes, associated with marked changes of Rab proteins, which regulate endosomal function. In primary neurons, fluvastatin enhanced the degradation of APP-CTFs through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Because our previous study suggests additive effects of fluvastatin on Abeta metabolism, we examined Abeta clearance rates by using the brain efflux index method and found its increased rates at high Abeta levels from brain. As LRP1 in brain microvessels was increased, up-regulation of LRP1-mediated Abeta clearance at the blood-brain barrier might be involved. In cultured brain microvessel endothelial cells, fluvastatin increased LRP1 and the uptake of Abeta, which was blocked by LRP1 antagonists, through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Overall, the present study demonstrated that fluvastatin reduced Abeta level by an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. ...",

Reaction of the 1,3-disubstituted indole with N-methyl-N-phenyl-3-aminoacrolein under Vilsmeier conditions affords the vinylogous aldehyde. For the preparation of N-methyl-N-phenyl-3-aminoacrolein a mixture of N-methyl-formanilide and butyl vinyl ether was added to oxalyl chloride, precipitation from isopropanol-hexane gave the reagent in 82% yield and 99% purity. In the next step the unsaturated aldehyde undergoes condensation with tert-butyl acetoacetate to tert-butyl 5-hydroxy-3-keto-6-heptenoate, which is diastereoselectively reduced to the syn-3,5-diol by means of methoxydiethylborane (generated in situ from triethylborane and methanol) and sodium borohydride at -78 \u00b0C (stereoselectivity 98-99%). Addition of aqueous hydrogen peroxide after the reduction step converts residual boronates into easily removable borates. The last step consists of hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ester. /Fluvastatin sodium/",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with fluvastatin capsules and other drugs in this class. There have been rare reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including fluvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with fluvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. Fluvastatin capsules are contraindicated in women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Fluvastatin capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Adverse drug reaction reports have demonstrated the occurrence of neuropsychiatric reactions associated with statin treatment. They include behavioral alterations; cognitive and memory impairments; sleep disturbance; and sexual dysfunction. ANIMAL STUDIES: The carcinogenicity study conducted in mice at dose levels of 0.3, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day revealed, as in rats, a statistically significant increase in forestomach squamous cell papillomas in males and females at 30 mg/kg/day and in females at 15 mg/kg/day. Fluvastatin produced delays in skeletal development in rats at doses of 12 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at doses of 10 mg/kg/day. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro, with or without metabolic activation, in the following studies: microbial mutagen tests using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli; malignant transformation assay in BALB/3T3 cells; unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes; chromosomal aberrations in V79 Chinese Hamster cells; HGPRT V79 Chinese Hamster cells. In addition, there was no evidence of mutagenicity in vivo in either a rat or mouse micronucleus test.",

In summary analyses of large scale studies with prospective monitoring, ALT elevations above normal occurred in up to 5% of patients; ALT levels of above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 1.1% of fluvastatin treated versus 0.3% of placebo recipients. These elevations were more common with higher doses of fluvastatin. Most of these elevations were self-limited and did not require dose modification. Fluvastatin is the statin most commonly associated with serum aminotransferase elevations and the highest rates of symptomatic liver injury, yet frank, clinically apparent hepatic injury from fluvastatin is still quite rare estimated to occur in 1.7 per 10,000 person years of use. In the few cases that have been reported, the onset of clinical injury has been within 1 to 4 months, the pattern of injury is typically cholestatic or mixed. Rash, fever and eosinophilia are uncommon. At least one case with features of autoimmunity has been described. Most cases resolve within a few months of onset. Rare cases of acute liver failure and death have been attributed to fluvastatin.",

Because of a concern with disruption of infant lipid metabolism, the consensus is that fluvastatin should not be used during breastfeeding. However, others have argued that children homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia are treated with statins beginning at 1 year of age, that statins have low oral bioavailability, and risks to the breastfed infant are low, especially with rosuvastatin and pravastatin.[1] Until more data become available, an alternate drug may be preferred, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant.",

Among the adverse effects associated with these drugs are statin-associated myopathies, ranging from asymptomatic elevation of serum creatine kinase to fatal rhabdomyolysis. ... We describe here a patient with liver cirrhosis who experienced fluvastatin-induced fatal rhabdomyolysis. This patient had been treated with simvastatin (20 mg/day) for coronary artery disease and was switched to fluvastatin (20 mg/day) 10 days before admission. He was also taking aspirin, betaxolol, candesartan, lactulose, and entecavir. Rhabdomyolysis was complicated and continued to progress. He was treated with massive hydration, urine alkalization, intravenous furosemide, and continuous renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure, but eventually died due to rhabdomyolysis complicated by hepatic failure. In conclusion, fluvastatin should be used with caution in patients with liver cirrhosis, especially with other medications metabolized with CYP2C9.",

By using fura-2 cytofluorimetry on intact extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers, here we provided the first evidence that 2 months in vivo chronic treatment of rats with fluvastatin (5 and 20 mg/kg) and atorvastatin (5 and 10 mg/kg) caused an alteration of calcium homeostasis. All treated animals showed a significant increase of resting cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i, up to 60% with the higher fluvastatin dose and up to 20% with the other treatments. The [Ca2+]i rise induced by statin administration was not due to an increase of sarcolemmal permeability to calcium. Furthermore, the treatments reduced caffeine responsiveness. In vitro application of fluvastatin caused changes of [Ca2+]i, resembling the effect obtained after the in vivo administration. Indeed, fluvastatin produced a shift of mechanical threshold for contraction toward negative potentials and an increase of resting [Ca2+]i. By using ruthenium red and cyclosporine A, we determined the sequence of the statin-induced Ca2+ release mechanism. Mitochondria appeared as the cellular structure responsible for the earlier event leading to a subsequent large sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. In conclusion, we suggest that calcium homeostasis alteration may be a crucial event for myotoxicity induced by this widely used class of hypolipidemic drugs.",

Treatment of HF diet-fed rats with fluvastatin (8 mg/kg) was lethal, followed by an elevation in levels of plasma aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase activities and skeletal muscle toxicity. This study was conducted to determine whether nutritional status affects statin-induced adverse effects in rats. Fluvastatin treatment of rats fed the HF diet led to an increase in systemic exposure, suggesting altered metabolism and elimination. In fact, although hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp) 2 and multidrug resistance (Mdr) 1b protein levels were not significantly changed by fluvastatin treatment for 8 days of rats fed a HF diet, the organic anion-transporting protein (Oatp) 1, Mrp3, CYP1A, CYP2C, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, and UGT1A5 protein levels were moderately decreased and the Oatp2, CYP3A, and UGT2B1 protein levels were markedly suppressed. No significant difference in the baseline level of Oatp1, Oatp2, Mrp2, Mrp3, Mdr1b, CYP1A, CYP2C, CYP3A, UGT1A1, UGT1A5, or UGT2B1 protein was found between the standard diet- and HF diet-fed groups. In addition, the mRNA levels of Oatp2, CYP2C11, and CYP3A1/2 were markedly decreased in HF diet-fed and fluvastatin-treated rats. There was no significant difference in the glucuronidation activities against fluvastatin among the four groups. In liver cell nuclei, levels of constitutive androstane receptor, pregnane X receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a proteins were decreased in fluvastatin-treated HF diet-fed rats, which correlated with the decrease in Oatp2, CYP2C, and CYP3A. Taken together, these results indicate that nutritional status may influence adverse effects of fluvastatin by increasing systemic exposure through modulation of hepatic uptake and elimination.",

Although the pathomechanism of statin-induced myopathy is not completely understood, changes in calcium homeostasis and reduced coenzyme Q10 levels are hypothesized to play important roles. In our experiments, fluvastatin and/or coenzyme Q10 was administered chronically to normocholesterolemic or hypercholestherolemic rats, and the modifications of the calcium homeostasis and the strength of their muscles were investigated. While hypercholesterolemia did not change the frequency of sparks, fluvastatin increased it on muscles both from normocholesterolemic and from hypercholesterolemic rats. This effect, however, was not mediated by a chronic modification of the ryanodine receptor as shown by the unchanged ryanodine binding in the latter group. While coenzyme Q10 supplementation significantly reduced the frequency of the spontaneous calcium release events, it did not affect their amplitude and spatial spread in muscles from fluvastatin-treated rats. This indicates that coenzyme Q10 supplementation prevented the spark frequency increasing effect of fluvastatin without having a major effect on the amount of calcium released during individual sparks. In conclusion, we have found that fluvastatin, independently of the cholesterol level in the blood, consistently and specifically increased the frequency of calcium sparks in skeletal muscle cells, an effect which could be prevented by the addition of coenzyme Q10 to the diet. These results support theories favoring the role of calcium handling in the pathophysiology of statin-induced myopathy and provide a possible pathway for the protective effect of coenzyme Q10 in statin treated patients symptomatic of this condition.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.9X10-16 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates fluvastatin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase fluvastatin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Fluvastatin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, fluvastatin is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 6000. The estimated pKa of fluvastatin is 4.5, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-17 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, fluvastatin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to fluvastatin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where fluvastatin is produced or used.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

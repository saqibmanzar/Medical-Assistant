PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The following antiepileptic drugs were used: valproate, carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital. In addition, the effects of antiepileptic drugs alone or in combination with antazoline or ketotifen were studied on long-term memory (tested in the passive avoidance task) and motor performance (evaluated in the chimney test), acutely and after 7-day treatment with these H1 receptor antagonists. The influence of antazoline and ketotifen on the free plasma and brain levels of the antiepileptics was also evaluated. Antazoline (at 0.5 mg/kg), given acutely and after 7-day treatment, significantly diminished the electroconvulsive threshold. Similarly, ketotifen, after acute and chronic doses of 8 mg/kg markedly reduced the threshold for electroconvulsions. In both cases, antazoline and ketotifen were without effect upon this parameter at lower doses. Antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) significantly raised the ED50 value of carbamazepine against MES (both, acutely and after 7-day treatment). Furthermore antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) also reduced the anticonvulsant activity of diphenylhydantoin, but only after repeated administration, without modifying the brain and free plasma level of this drug. Moreover, valproate and phenobarbital did not change their protective activity when combined with antazoline. ... Only acute antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) applied with valproate impaired the performance of mice evaluated in the chimney test. Ketotifen (4 mg/kg) co-administered with conventional antiepileptic drugs impaired motor coordination in mice treated with valproate, phenobarbital or diphenylhydantoin. Acute and chronic antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) alone or in combination with antiepileptic drugs did not disturb long-term memory, tested in the passive avoidance task. ... The results of this study indicate that H1 receptor antagonists, crossing the blood brain barrier, should be used with caution in epileptic patients. This is because antazoline reduced the protective potential of diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine.",

They also have effects against mouse cerebellar and striatal neuronal death induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) through the blockade of NMDA currents. Here, we investigated the effects of antazoline on NMDA toxicity and current in rat hippocampal neuronal cultures, and on an in vivo model of status epilepticus. In hippocampal cultures, antazoline (30 uM) decreased NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity and also blocked the NMDA current with voltage-dependent and fast-reversible action (inhibition by 85+ or - 3% at -60 mV). Status epilepticus was induced by injecting pilocarpine (200 nmol) directly into the right pyriform cortex of male adult rats. The rats then received immediately three consecutive i.p. injections at 30-min intervals of either PBS (control group) or antazoline at 10 mg/kg (low-dose group) or at 45 mg/kg (high-dose group). During the 6-hr recording, status epilepticus lasted more than 200 min in all groups. In the high-dose group only, seizures completely ceased 1 hr after the third injection of antazoline, then started again 1 hr later. Rats were killed 1 week later, and Cresyl Violet-stained sections of their brain were analysed for damage quantification. On the ipsilateral side to the pilocarpine injection, pyriform cortex and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas were significantly protected in both antazoline-treated groups, whilst prepyriform and entorhinal cortices were only in the high-dose group. On the contralateral side to the pilocarpine injection, only the hippocampal CA3 area was significantly protected in the low-dose group, but all investigated structures were in the high-dose group.In conclusion, antazoline is a potent neuroprotective drug in different models of neuronal primary culture, as previously shown in striatal and cerebellar granule neurons, and here in hippocampal neurons. Antazoline is also neuroprotective in vivo in the intra-pyriform pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus model.",

In striatal neuronal cultures from mouse embryos the imidazoline compound, antazoline, inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by acting at a phencyclidine-like site. This effect was fast, fully reversible, voltage-dependent and predominant on P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels. Taken together, these results suggest that imidazolines may elicit neuroprotective effects also by decreasing the release of glutamate through inhibition of presynaptic Ca2+ channels.",

Thyrotropin releasing hormone in doses from 0.1 to 1.0 mg evoked dose-dependent micturition. In cats treated with intracerebroventricular reserpine and 6-hydroxydopamine, but not with intracerebroventricular 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine and hemicholinium, the micturition caused by intracerebroventricular thyrotropin releasing hormone was abolished. Chlorpromazine and antazoline injected into the cerebral ventricles prevented the micturition induced by intracerebroventricular thyrotropin releasing hormone. On the other hand, mecamylamine, yohimbine, propranolol, atropine and methysergide injected intracerebroventricular had virtually no effect or partially antagonized the micturition evoked by thyrotropin releasing hormone similarly injected. It is apparent therefore that centrally induced thyrotropin releasing hormone micturition could be related to central catecholaminergic mechanisms.",

Mecamylamine and hexamethonium but not atropine, scopolamine, yohimbine, phenoxybenzamine, tolazoline, propranolol, practolol, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, antazoline and methysergide abolished the convulsions evoked by nicotine. Furthermore, reserpine, but not 6-hydroxydopamine, as well as 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine and hemicholinium blocked the convulsions caused by nicotine. It appears, therefore, that the convulsions produced by nicotine are mediated through central nicotinic receptors. However, the depressed catecholaminergic, 5-hydroxytryptaminergic and histaminergic mechanisms induced by reserpine can also suppress the convulsions evoked by nicotine.",

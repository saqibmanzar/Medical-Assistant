PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The maximal metabolic elimination rates are 340 umol/kg/hr for rats and 560 umol/kg/hr for mice. The atmospheric concentration at which Vmax/2 is reached is 1200 ppm for rats and 1800 ppm for mice. At steady state, below atmospheric concentrations of about 500 ppm the rate of metabolism of isobutene is direct proportional to its concentration. 1,1-Dimethyloxirane is formed as a primary reactive intermediate during metabolism of isobutene in rats and can be detected in the exhaled air of the animals. Under conditions of saturation of isobutene metabolism the concentration of 1,1-dimethyloxirane in the atmosphere of a closed exposure system is only about 1/15 of that observed for ethene oxide and about 1/100 of that observed for 1,2-epoxy-3-butene as intermediates in the metabolism of ethene or 1,3-butadiene.",

Interspecies comparison revealed that the lowest levels of the primary epoxide metabolite were detected in incubations of 2-methylpropene with human liver homogenate, followed by rat and mouse, respectively. Among the human liver samples, however, important interindividual variations were observed. Out of the 16 samples analyzed, only 2 contained measurable epoxide amounts, while in the other samples only traces were detectable. The involvement of rat liver cytochrome P450 2E1 in the activation of 2-methylpropene to its epoxide 2-methyl-1,2-epoxypropane has been established. The lower capacity of the mixed function oxidase system in human liver samples compared to rodents is confirmed. Concerning epoxide detoxifying enzymes, a high microsomal epoxide hydrolase activity was observed in human liver tissue and an intermediate in rat liver, while a low activity was measured in mouse liver. These findings were inversely correlated with the epoxide levels measured in vitro in liver tissue of the three species studied. It can be concluded that, as far as the in vitro metabolism of 2-methylpropene is concerned, neither mouse nor rat represents a good model for the human situation. Although, the same biotransformation pathways are involved, marked quantitative differences in epoxide levels were observed. The results indicate that human liver tissue is exposed in vitro to smaller concentrations of the primary metabolite 2-methyl-1,2-epoxypropane than rodent liver.",

As an aid to planning long-term toxicity studies, research was conducted to determine the effect of exposure concentrations on the absorption and metabolism of isobutene in F344/N rats. Male F344/N rats (11-15 weeks of age) were exposed for 2 hr to 0, 40, 400, or 4000 ppm isobutene, and a time-course evaluation of blood levels of isobutene was performed using headspace analysis methods. Blood levels of isobutene were linearly related to exposure concentrations between 40 and 400 ppm but increased in a supralinear fashion at the highest concentration, suggesting that the capacity of the rats to metabolize isobutene had been exceeded. Total uptake, excretion patterns, and metabolic conversions were studied in rats exposed for up to 6 hr to 0, 2, 40, 400, or 4000 ppm [(14)C]isobutene. Absorption of the inhaled isobutene was approximately 8% up to 40 ppm isobutene, but decreased at the higher concentrations. The amount of isobutene metabolized per ppm.hr of exposure was also linear up to 40 ppm but decreased at higher concentrations. Over 90% of the absorbed isobutene was metabolized at exposure concentrations up to 400 ppm, but the exposure to approximately 4000 ppm isobutene resulted in approximately 20% of the absorbed dose exhaled as the unmetabolized isobutene. Two urinary metabolites were identified as isobutenediol and 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid. Two other urinary metabolites were tentatively identified as sulfate conjugates of isobutenediol. Based on these studies, linear dose-response relationships would be expected in chronic toxicity studies for exposures up to 40 ppm isobutene ...",

Do not direct water at spill or source of leak. CAUTION: For LNG - Liquefied natural gas (UN1972), DO NOT apply water, regular or alcohol-resistant foam directly on spill. Use a high-expansion foam if available to reduce vapors. Prevent spreading of vapors through sewers, ventilation systems and confined areas. Isolate area until gas has dispersed. CAUTION: When in contact with refrigerated/cryogenic liquids, many materials become brittle and are likely to break without warning. (ERG, 2024)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used to produce diisobutylene, trimers, butyl rubber, and other polymers. It is also used to produce antioxidants for foods, packaging, food supplements, and for plastics. HUMAN STUDIES: Isobutene causes CNS depression at higher concentrations. There is a linear relationship between the degree of CNS depression and the cerebral concentrations. Isobutylene was not mutagenic when tested in the in vitro micronucleus test using human lymphocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Isobutene, at 30%, produces no CNS depression in mice, and excitement and CNS depression in 7 to 8 min at 40%, but immediate CNS depression in 2-2.25 min at 50%, or in 50-60 sec at 60 to 70%. Exposure to isobutene by inhalation for 2 years resulted in increased incidences and/or severities of nasal lesions including hyaline degeneration of the olfactory epithelium in mice and hyaline degeneration of the respiratory epithelium in male and female mice. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of isobutylene in male or female mice exposed to 500, 2,000, or 8,000 ppm 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 105 weeks. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of isobutene in male rats based on an increased incidence of follicular cell carcinoma of the thyroid gland. It was negative when tested for mutagenicity in Escherichia coli, the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay, and a modified Salmonella assay, with and without metabolic activation. No increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was seen in peripheral blood of male or female mice treated with isobutylene by inhalation for 14 weeks.",

In this study, both compounds have been tested in the in vitro micronucleus test using human lymphocytes. Propylene oxide, a well known mutagenic compound, served as a positive control. It was found that 2-methylpropene had no mutagenic effect, whereas its epoxide induced a statistically significant dose-dependent increase in the number of micronuclei. The effect observed was comparable with that obtained for propylene oxide.",

Data from studies of induction of chemical thrombosis in rodents help to identify substances in our environment that may contribute to cardiac thrombosis. Results for more than 500 chemicals tested in rodents in 2-year bioassays have been published as Technical Reports of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) ... We evaluated atrial thrombosis induced by these chemical exposures and compared it to similarly induced lesions reported in the literature. Spontaneous rates of cardiac thrombosis were determined for control Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice: 0% in rats and mice in 90-day studies and, in 2-year studies, 0.7% in both genders of mice, 4% in male rats, and 1% in female rats. Incidences of atrial thrombosis were increased in high-dosed groups involving 13 compounds (incidence rate: 20-100%): 2-butoxyethanol, C.I. Direct Blue 15, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane, diazoaminobenzene, diethanolamine, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride, hexachloroethane, isobutene, methyleugenol, oxazepam, C.I. Pigment Red 23, C.I. Acid Red 114, and 4,4'-thiobis(6-t-butyl-m-cresol). The main localization of spontaneously occurring and chemically induced thromboses occurred in the left atrium. The literature survey suggested that chemical-induced atrial thrombosis might be closely related to myocardial injury, endothelial injury, circulatory stasis, hypercoagulability, and impaired atrial mechanical activity, such as atrial fibrillation, which could cause stasis of blood within the left atrial appendage, contributing to left atrial thrombosis ...",

A simple exposure system, consisting of gastight tissue culture flasks, was used. This method has the advantage that the volatile test chemical is present during the entire incubation period and that several concentrations of the investigated compound can be tested on a single day. MP is not mutagenic in strains TA100, TA102 and TA1535, and in the latter strain not even in the presence of metabolizing S9 mix. MEP is mutagenic in all the strains tested, as demonstrated by a clear dose-response relationship. Strain TA1535 seems to be most sensitive to MEP compared with the other bacterial strains studied. For this strain, the mutagenic activity of MEP decreased significantly in the presence of S9 mix, compatible with the epoxide being inactivated by epoxide hydrolase and by glutathione S-transferase, as reported previously. From the present study it can be concluded that the parent compound MP is not mutagenic, but that its primary metabolite MEP is a mutagenic substance. However, very high concentrations are necessary to induce a mutagenic effect and the epoxide is efficiently detoxified by different liver enzymes.",

It is also released to the environment from the exhaust of automobiles and other gasoline powered engines. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2,308 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isobutylene will exist solely as a gas in the ambient atmosphere. Gas-phase isobutylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone molecules with atmospheric half-lives of about 7.5 and 23 hours, respectively. Isobutylene does not absorb UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isobutylene is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 32. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.218 atm-cu m/mole. Isobutylene will volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Isobutylene was degraded to 1,2-epoxy butane by pure cultures of methanotrophic bacteria, suggesting biodegradation may occur at intefaces between aerobic and anaerobic conditions. If released into water, isobutylene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 71 hours, respectively. An estimated BCF of 16 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to isobutylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isobutylene is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to isobutylene via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Isobutylene is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2,308 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.218 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 71 hours, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 16(SRC), from its log Kow of 2.34(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Isobutylene was degraded to 1,2-epoxy butane by pure cultures of methanotrophic bacteria(7), suggesting biodegradation may occur at intefaces between aerobic and anaerobic conditions in water(SRC).",

Gas-phase isobutylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.14X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The rate constant for the gas-phase reaction of isobutylene with ozone has been measured as 1.2X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 23 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(4). Isobutylene does not absorb UV light at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Combined isomers of isobutylene and 1-butene were detected in the Lincoln Tunnel, NY at a mean concentration of 344.9 ppb in 1970 and 89.1 ppb in 1982(2). Isobutylene concentrations of <5 mg HC/km were determined in the exhaust emissions from gasoline- and LPG-powered catalyst-equipped vehicles operating at the altitude of Mexico City in 1996(3). An average concentration of 758.8 ug/cu m (6 samples) was reported in the air at an ethanol and gasoline service station with 5 pumps in the Flamengo District, Rio de Janiero, Brazil, sampled on June 9, 2004(4).",

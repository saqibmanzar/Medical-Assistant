When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Isotopes are variants of a chemical element which differ in neutron number.  For example, among three isotopes of carbon (i.e., C-12, C-13, and C-14), the isotope atom count considers the C-13 and C-14 atoms, because C-12 is the most abundant isotope of carbon.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

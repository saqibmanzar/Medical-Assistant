When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

Chlorodifluoromethane is also used to produce the fluorocarbon monomer tetrafluoroethylene by pyrolysis at 650-700 \u00b0C. The tetrafluoroethylene monomer forms homopolymers or copolymers with other chlorofluorocarbons used in plastics and resins. Unlike other chlorofluorocarbons, chlorodifluoromethane is not currently used to a large degree as a blowing agent for polyurethane resins or as an industrial solvent, but these applications have been reported previously. The azeotropic mixture (F-502) of chlorodifluoromethane/chloropentafluoroethane (F-115) is also used as a refrigerant, primarily in food display cases, ice makers, home freezers and heat pumps.",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

HCFCs were developed as transitional substitutes for Class I substances and are subject to a later phaseout schedule than Class I substances. ... Although there are currently 34 controlled HCFCs, only a few are commonly used. The most widely used have been HCFC-22 (usually a refrigerant), HCFC-141b (a solvent and foam-blowing agent), and HCFC-142b (a foam-blowing agent and component in refrigerant blends). ... As a Party to the Montreal Protocol, the U.S. must incrementally decrease HCFC consumption and production, culminating in a complete HCFC phaseout in 2030. The major milestones that are upcoming for developed countries are a reduction in 2010 to at least 75 percent below baseline HCFC levels and a reduction in 2015 to at least 90 percent below baseline.  Section 605 of the Clean Air Act sets the U.S. phaseout targets for Class II substances. In 1993, the EPA established the phaseout framework and the \"worst-first\" approach that focused first on HCFC-22, HCFC-141b, and HCFC-142b because these three HCFCs have the highest ODPs of all HCFCs. To meet the required 2004 reduction, the EPA phased out HCFC-141b in 2003 and froze the production and consumption of HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. In 2009, EPA reduced the production and import of virgin HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b and limited the use of those compounds to meet the Montreal Protocol's 2010 milestones.",

The \"2010 HCFC Allocation Rule\" allocated allowances for each year between 2010 and 2014. To meet the stepdown, the number of allowances for HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b were less than for the 2003-2009 control periods. EPA also issued allowances for HCFC-123, HCFC-124, HCFC-225ca, and HCFC-225cb. The rules also limited the use of virgin HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b to existing refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment. The \"Pre-Charted Appliances Rule\" banned the sale or distribution of air-conditioning and refrigeration products containing HCFC-22, HCFC-142b, or blends containing one or both of these substances, beginning January 1, 2010. ... The \"2010 HCFC Allocation Rule\" was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Arkema v EPA. In August, 2010, the court decided against EPA. EPA interprets the Court's decision as vacating the portion of the rule that establishes company-by-company production and consumption baselines and calendar-year allowances for HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b. All other aspects of the rule are intact. On August 5, 2011, EPA issued an interim final rule that establishes new company-by-company HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b baselines and allocates production and consumption allowances for 2011.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011. Removal of 2.125(e)(2)(iv) and Part 2.125(e)(4)(viii) is effective December 31, 2013. /Ozone-Depleting Substances/",

A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin & countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40-42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned.

Ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded for 24 hr on the day of exposure & on a control day. The ECG tapes were automatically analysed with a Reynolds pathfinder 3 apparatus & all aberrant complexes recorded by the machine were checked. One person read all the tapes without knowing whether or not they were recorded during exposure. The number of ventricular ectopic beats were compared between the day of exposure & the control day & with the tape of the control. In addn, the number of ventricular ectopic beats during exposure was compared with the number occurring during the rest of the day. The concns of fluorocarbons were measured in 4 instances. High peak concns of fluorocarbons (1300-10,000 cm3/m3) were measured during refrigerator repair work. No clear connection between fluorocarbons & cardiac arrhythmia was found, although one subject had several ventricular ectopic beats which may have been connected with exposure.",

Investigations on the causes of death made at post mortem showed that the worker had absorbed a large quantity of freon 22 (chlorodifluoromethane) which is known to be a /CNS depressant/ agent and capable of inducing cardiac arrhythmia. It is believed freon inhalation was the cause of loss of consciousness with consequent death from drowning in the water issuing from the pipes. It is concluded that preventive measures need to be reinforced by adequate information to the workforce on the risks connected to this type of gas.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.25X10+3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chlorodifluoromethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase chlorodifluoromethane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.4 years. As a result of its long half-life, a substantial fraction of chlorodifluoromethane will slowly diffuse to the stratosphere. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radicals and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine. These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. In the troposphere, however, chlorodifluoromethane is not expected to undergo direct photolysis since it does not absorb light >290 nm. If released to soil, chlorodifluoromethane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8.6. However, since chlorodifluoromethane is a gas under ambient conditions, most of the chemical released on soil will volatilize rapidly, effectively reducing the potential for leaching into groundwater. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.06X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Chlorodifluoromethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, chlorodifluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.7 hours and 3.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2.4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process due to chlorodifluoromethane's low rate of hydrolysis (<0.01 g/L-yr). Occupational exposure to chlorodifluoromethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chlorodifluoromethane is produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chlorodifluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air and from leaky refrigeration units containing chlorodifluoromethane.

When chlorodifluoromethane is used in refrigeration, there is a delay of six to seven years between its production and its release into the atmosphere(2). Based on information from producers, approximately 2.5% of chlorodifluoromethane is released directly into the environment during packaging operations and from factory vents(1). In operations in which chlorodifluoromethane is used as a chemical intermediate, approximately 1% is lost during chemical processing(1). The use of chlorodifluoromethane has been increasing markedly since it is one of the few fluorocarbons currently not restricted by the Montreal Protocol for the protection of the ozone layer(3). However, consumption and production of HCFCs, including chlordifluoromethane were stopped in 1996 and 2004, respectively, for developed countries, with a 100% phase-out mandated by 2030(4). Annual worldwide production (in X10+6 kg) of chlorodifluoromethane from 1970 to 1994 were as follows: 56.1 (1970), 75.0 (1975), 126.3 (1980), 153.4 (1985), 213.7 (1990), and 239.4 (1994)(1,5). Annual worldwide release (in X10+6 kg) to the environment, based on production data, are: 41.4 (1970), 65.7 (1975), 104.3 (1980), 137.2 (1985), 195.2 (1990), and 218.9 (1994)(1,5). In the United States alone, 82,000 tons of chlorodifluoromethane was released into the environment in 1990(5). Over the period 1991 to 1995, worldwide production of chlorodifluoromethane remained virtually constant at 240 Gg/year, however emissions to the atmosphere increased from 195 Gg during 1990 to 225 Gg in 1995(6). Emissions of chlorodifluoromethane determined from aircraft measurements were reported as average concentrations of 46 Gg/year for the United States between 2004 and 2006 and 7.5 Gg/year for Mexico in 2006(4). Chlorodifluoromethane was reported as the single largest contributor to the U.S. halocarbon global warming potential(4). The country with the second highest emission of chlorodifluoromethane was the Russian Federation at 20,500 tons(2). Production surveys have indicated that 90% of total production of chlorodifluoromethane was sold in the northern hemisphere between 1980 to 1991(1).",

Gas-phase chlorodifluoromethane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9.4 years(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.68X10-15 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). As a result of its long half-life, a substantial fraction of the chlorodifluoromethane will slowly diffuse to the upper stratosphere. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine at high altitudes(4). These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. In the troposphere, however, chlorodifluoromethane is not expected to undergo direct photolysis since it does not absorb light >290 nm(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9.4 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). As a result of its long half-life, a substantial fraction of the chlorodifluoromethane will slowly diffuse to the upper stratosphere. Once in the upper stratosphere, it is dissociated through photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical and excited atomic oxygen resulting in the release of chlorine at high altitudes(3). These chlorine atoms then become part of a catalytic process that contributes to the destruction of the ozone layer. The estimated tropospheric half-life of chlorodifluoromethane is 9.1 years(4) while the estimated total lifetime of chlorodifluoromethane in the atmosphere ranges from 13.6 to 15 years(5,6). Chlorodifluoromethane is not expected to undergo direct photolysis in the troposphere or in surface waters since it does not absorb light >290 nm(7). The rate of chlorodifluoromethane hydrolysis is very low, <0.01 g/L-yr at 30 \u00b0C, and is not expected to be an important degradation pathway in the environment(8).",

Known atmospheric reactions for halocarbon source gases include photolysis, reaction with hydroxyl radical (OH) in both the troposphere and stratosphere, reaction with electronically excited atomic oxygen (O(1D)) and atomic chlorine (Cl) chiefly in the stratosphere, uptake in oceanic surface waters through chemical and biological degradation processes, biological degradation in soils, and possibly surface reactions on minerals. Not all halocarbon source gases become degraded by all of these processes. The quantitative determinations of trace gas reaction strengths are of interest because the reactions control both the atmospheric lifetimes and the location of halogen release from source gases. The important processes for atmospheric lifetime are those that have significant strength on a mass or molecule basis, that is, where loss frequency and  atmospheric abundance are co-located. A simple definition of lifetime is the sum of the integrals over the entire atmosphere of the product of the first-order reaction process frequencies (the local instantaneous lifetimes) and the normalized source gas mass or concentration distribution(1). /Hydrohalocarbons/",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The presence of chlorodifluoromethane in landfill gas is expected to be due to direct volatilization from plastic foam, aerosol propellants, and refrigerators. Based on emission rates monitored in 1995 from the UK, the total global emission of chlorodifluoromethane is 1.4X10+8 kg/year(1). Dust samples from a municipal waste incinerator located in Hamburg, Germany were analyzed for chlorodifluoromethane concentrations(2). The study determined that chlorodifluoromethane concentrations ranged from <0.005 to 0.89 mg/kg waste. When municipal waste was added to a laboratory anaerobic digester, levels of chlorodifluoromethane were measured in both the gas and leachate. Maximum chlorodifluoromethane concentrations were 385 mg/N cu m in gas samples and 0.9 mg/L in leachate(2).",

In May 1982, the average atmospheric concentration of chlorodifluoromethane in the lower troposphere measured over Point Barrow, Alaska was 73.2 parts per trillion (259.0 ng/cu m)(1). The concentration of chlorodifluoromethane present in the ambient atmosphere was reported to be 88 pmol/mol in 1990(2). In January 1980, the concentration of chlorodifluoromethane in the remote Pacific Northwest and the South Pole was 63 and 45 parts per trillion, respectively(3). At Barrows Alaska, the concentration was highest in January (62.5 parts per trillion( and lowest in July (55.3 parts per trillion)(4). The median concentration of chlorodifluoromethane at two rural/remote sites in the United States from the 1970s was 14 parts per trillion(5). A global mean concentration of 101.8 parts/trillion and interhemispheric difference of 13 parts/trillion were determined for chlorodifluoromethane in 1992 from air collected in flasks from 7 remote sites(6).",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and pentachloro-3-butenoic acid induce unscheduled DNA synthesis both in the presence and absence of an exogenous metabolizing system. The lowest ED (ED) for unscheduled DNA synthesis induction is smaller for pentachloro-3-butenoic acid (1 ug/ml) than for hexachloro-1,3-butadiene (2 ug/ ml). The intensity of unscheduled DNA synthesis induction is increased approx 3-fold for both cmpd after metabolic activation. Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and pentachloro-3-butenoic acid induce morphologic transformation. The lowest ED for transformation differs considerably between pentachloro-3-butenoic acid (0.8 ug/ml) and HCBD (10 ug/ml).",

This reactive metabolite(s) has been reported to cause mitochondrial dysfunction. ... The effect of 3 haloalkene cysteine conjugate on the activity of rat renal cortical cytosolic glutathione reductase & mitochondrial lipoyl dehydrogenase, 2 enzyme which have been reported to be inhibited by S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cyteine in the liver /have been examined/. N-acetyl-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-L-cysteine produced a time- & concn-dependent inhibition of glutathione reductase & kinetic studies showed that the inhibition was noncompetitive with a Ki of 215 microM. The enzyme activity from male rat kidney was more sensitive to N-acetyl-S-(1,2,3,4, 4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-L-cysteine than that from female rat kidney. Amino-oxyacetic acid, an inhibitor of cysteine conjugate beta-lyase, & bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, an amidase inhibitor, blocked the effect of N-acetyl-S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-L-cysteine on glutathion reductase, indicating that metab by the cytosol is required to produce enzyme inhibition. S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine & -(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine are also noncompetitive inhibitors of glutathione reductase but are less active than N-acetyl-S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-L-cysteine with Ki's of 2.6 & 6.2 mM for S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine & S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine, respectively, S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine produced a time- & concn-dependent inhibition of lipoyl dehydrogense & kinetic studies showed that the inhibition was noncompetitive with Ki of 762 umol. S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine & S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3- butadienyl)-L-cysteine also inhibit lipoyl dehydrogenase. Aminooxyacetic acid blocked the effect of S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine, S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine, & S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3- butadienyl)-L-cysteine on lipoyl dehydrogenase, indicating that metab by the mitochondrial fraction is required to produce enzyme inhibition. Glutathione reductase activity in the renal cortex of male rats treated with 200 mg/kg hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was inhibited as early as 1 hr after dosing, before signs of marked morphological damage. The activity of lipoyl dehydrogenase was also reduced but was only statistically significant 8 hr after dosing when there was marked renal dysfunction. These findings indicate that reactive thiol moiety formed by cysteine conjugate beta-lyase cleavage of S-(1,2,3,4,4-pentachloro-1,3-butadienyl)-L-cysteine can inhibit both glutathione reductase & lipoyl dehydrogenase activities in vivo following hexachloro-1,3- butadiene admin. We suggest that such inhibition is a general phenomenon, occurring with diverse & as yet unidentified renal proteins.",

The bis-conjugates 1,4-(bis-glutathione-S- yl-1,2,3,4-tetrachloro-1,3-butadiene and 1,4-(bis-cystein-S-yl)-1,2,3,4- tetrachloro-1,3-butadiene were not mutagenic in the strains TA100, TA2638 and TA98. Purified hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was not mutagenic either with exogenous metabolic activation or with rat liver microsomes fortified with NADPH. Preincubation with rat liver microsomes and glutathione resulted in an unequivocal mutagenic activity of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene which was increased by additional inclusion of rat kidney microsomes. The cysteine conjugate beta- lyase inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid decreased the mutagenicity of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and its S-conjugates. These results provide strong evidence that formation of the corresponding monoglutathione S-conjugate from hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and subsequent cleavage of this conjugate by gamma-glutamylltranspeptidase and beta-lyase may be responsible for the nephrocarcinogenicity of the parent compound in vivo, whereas formation of the bis-glutathione S-conjugate probably plays no role in the organ specific effects of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene.",

[3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The carcinogenic properties of hexachlorobutadiene are proposed to result from binding of the sulfenic acid degradation product or a thioketene intermediate to cellular DNA. The binding of hexachlorobutadiene to alpha 2u-globulin is believed to be an important factor in its nephrotoxicity. (L94, A54)",

The group treated with piperonyl butoxide and hexachloro-1,3-butadiene had the same glomerular filtration rate as the group treated not different from the oil-pretreated controls. At 48 hr after hexachloro-1,3-butadiene, reabsorption of water and glucose was more severely impaired in the group pretreated with piperonyl butoxide.

Two major pathways of metabolism have been suggested which call for mediation either by cytochrome p450 or by glutathione conjugation. As an example of cytochrome p450 mediated activation, chloroform was discussed. As examples of glutathione conjugation followed by activation, the dihaloethanes and hexachloro-1,3-butadiene were discussed. Several biological tests have been developed which can be used to detect chronic nephrotoxicity as chronic low level exposures can occur in the work place. Many case histories existed in the literature of accidental or deliberate exposure to chlorinated compounds, resulting in acute toxicity. Screening tests for chronic renal injury included urine analysis, blood analyses, and functional tests. Studies which have been conducted of workers exposed chronically to organohalogenated solvents have indicated central nervous system depression, liver injury and, occasionally, acute renal failure. Owing mainly to the marked functional compensatory ability of the kidney, chronic exposure at the work place may be difficult to detect. The following combination of tests may be useful for detecting such dysfunction in occupationally exposed workers: examination of urine with reagent strips for the presence of glucosuria and proteinuria, and quantitative determination of at least two proteins, one of the high molecular weight for glomerular function and one of the low molecular weight for tubular function. Some value has also come from the determination of the lysosomal enzyme N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in urine.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.22 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates hexachloro-1,3-butadiene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase hexachloro-1,3-butadiene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 534 days. Direct photolysis of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene is expected to occur due to absorption of light in the environmental UV spectrum (>290 nm). If released to soil, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene is expected to have low to no mobility based upon a range of Koc values from 5.02X10+3 to 2.75X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.03X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene vaporization from light (silty) soils is more rapid than from heavy (clayey) soils. If released into water, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the range of Kocs. Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene biodegrades in aqueous aerobic and anaerobic batch tests. Estimated disappearance half-lives for hexachloro-1,3-butadiene, which are based upon monitoring data, are 3-30 days in river water and 30-300 days in lake and ground waters. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.7 hours and 6.4 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. BCF values for hexachloro-1,3-butadiene from 5800 to 17000 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to hexachloro-1,3-butadiene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexachloro-1,3-butadiene and tetrachloroethylene are produced. Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene is produced as a by-product of tetrachloroethylene manufacture. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hexachloro-1,3-butadiene via inhalation of ambient air, and ingestion of food and drinking water contaminated with this compound.

Volatilization of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.03X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(5). However, volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC). One day and 1 month after a spring application of 250 kg hexachloro-1,3-butadiene/ha in a vineyard, the air contained 0.08 and 0.003 mg hexachloro-1,3-butadiene/cu m, respectively(4). After an application of 150 kg, corresponding values were 0.06 and 0.001 mg/ha, respectively(6). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene vaporization from light (silty) soils was more rapid than from heavy (clayey) soils(6). Raising temperatures from 13 to 18 deg hastened hexachloro-1,3-butadiene vaporization 5-fold in static conditions, and its application on granulated superphosphate decreased vaporization in comparison with liquid application(6). In aerobic and anaerobic batch tests in aqueous systems, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene biodegrades(7-9); thus, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene may biodegrade in soil(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(5) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.03X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.7 hours and 6.4 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 201 days if adsorption is considered(7). According to a classification scheme(8), BCF values for hexachloro-1,3-butadiene from 5,800 to 17,000 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(9-10). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene may biodegrade in natural waters(11). Estimated half-lives for hexachloro-1,3-butadiene disappearance based on monitoring data are 3-30 days in river water and 30-300 days in lake and ground waters(12). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene biodegrades under methanogenic conditions(13,14).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 534 days at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). An estimate of tropospheric half-life obtained from monitoring data at remote sites is 1.6 yr in the northern hemisphere and 0.6 yr in the southern hemisphere(2). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3). In the laboratory, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was adsorbed on silica gel, placed in a pure oxygen atmosphere, and exposed to an artificial light source through quartz or pyrex glass(4). After a 3 day exposure through the quartz filter, 10-50% of the theoretical HCl and/or Cl2 and 50-90% of the CO2 were formed; after 6 days exposure through the pyrex filter (>290 nm wavelength), 50-90% of the theoretical HCl and/or CO2 and 50-90% of the CO2 were formed(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 1.7 hours(SRC).

Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was found at concns of 10 and 23 ug/l in water sampled beyond the boundaries of two chemical plants(2). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene concn in an open waste treatment pond was 244 ug/l(2). Mississippi River water at Baton Rouge, LA contained 1.9 ppb of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene(3). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was found in the Ashtabula River (Ohio) at an unspecified concn(4). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene has also been detected in Lake Erie water(5). Grab samples of water from Lake Ontario, the Niagara River, and the Detroit River contained mean hexachloro-1,3-butadiene concns of 0.01, 0.2, and 0.1 parts per trillion, respectively(6). Between 1982 and 1985 the average concn of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in the Rhine River ranged from 0.01-0.1 ppb(7). The concn of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in the North Sea off the coast of the Netherlands during 1983-1984 ranged from <0.02-1.30 parts per trillion, median 0.23 parts per trillion(8). Since the concn in the Rhine River was 15 parts per trillion, it was concluded that the river was a source of this contaminant(8). The range of concns of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in the River Elbe upstream (at Zollenspieker) and downstream (at Seemannshoft) of Hamburg, Germany was 2-4.23 ng/l and 2.3-2.6 ng/l, respectively(9).",

PWS water quality testing is performed at many points in the system, including the intake and at various points in the treatment and distribution systems, as well as at the point where the drinking water can be labeled as finished drinking water(1). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene concn ranged from 0.04 to 0.70 ug/l in New Orleans drinking water from the Carrollton water plant(2).

Crayfish from a ditch near Baton Rouge, LA contained 70.1 ppb hexachloro-1,3-butadiene(1). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene was found, but not quantified, in fish from the Ashtabula River, Ohio(2) and the Wabash River, Indiana(3). Mean hexachloro-1,3-butadiene concn in Lake Ontario rainbow trout was 0.2 ng/g(4). Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene has also been detected in fish from Lakes Erie, Huron, and Superior(5). A study of 9 Great Lakes harbors and tributaries in Ohio and Wisconsin, between 1980 and 1981, found no hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in composite fish samples(6). A study of the distribution of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers using clams (E. complanatus) suspended in cages, found that none of the sites in the Detroit R. and 55% of the sites in the St. Clair River contained levels of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene above the detection limit, 1 ppb, wet wt(7). The highest mean concn was 83 ppb and results indicated that sources of pollutants were present in the Sarnia area(7). Residues of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene were found in 10 samples from fish collected from within 25 miles (40 km) of tetrachloroethylene or trichloroethylene production plant sites, at levels ranging from 0.01 to 1.2 mg/kg(8) In a United Kingdom study, various organs of 15 species of fish contained hexachloro-1,3-butadiene residues ranging from 0 to 2.6 ug/kg(8).",

Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene is produced as a by-product of tetrachloroethylene manufacture(2). The max hexachloro-1,3-butadiene concn at nine manufacturing plants was 460 ug/cu m(3). In another study, the max observed concn of hexachloro-1,3-butadiene in workplace air from municipal solid waste composting facilities was 4 ug/cu m(4). Semiconductor plasma etching process workers may potentially be exposed to high levels of by- products, such as hexachloro-1,3-butadiene, in the workplace through accidents, maintenance procedures, or insufficient protection(5).

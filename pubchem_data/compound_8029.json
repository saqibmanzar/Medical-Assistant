It is soluble in common organic solvents, including alcohol, ether and acetone, but is insoluble in water. It is toxic and may be carcinogenic. Furan is used as a starting point to other specialty chemicals. Furan is a heterocyclic organic compound, consisting of a five-membered aromatic ring with four carbon atoms and one oxygen. The class of compounds containing such rings are also referred to as furans. Furan is aromatic because one of the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atom is delocalized into the ring, creating a 4n+2 aromatic system (see Huckel's rule) similar to benzene. Because of the aromaticity, the molecule is flat and lacks discrete double bonds. The other lone pair of electrons of the oxygen atom extends in the plane of the flat ring system. The sp2 hybridization is to allow one of the lone pairs of oxygen to reside in a p orbital and thus allow it to interact within the pi-system. The Feist-Benary synthesis is a classic way to synthesize furans, although many syntheses have been developed. One of the simplest synthesis methods for furans is the reaction of 1,4-diketones with phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) in the Paal-Knorr Synthesis. The thiophene formation reaction of 1,4-diketones with Lawesson's reagent also forms furans as side products. 2,4-Disubstituted furans can be synthesized by sulfone-mediated cyclization of 1,3-diketones",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The Committee's benchmark dose analysis of liver tumor incidence data from an oral bioassay in mice calculated benchmark dose lower confidence limits for 10% increase in cancer incidence (BMDL10) values ranging from 1.34 to 1.89 mg/kg bw/d. The Committee used the value of 1.34 mg/kg bw/d, adjusted to 0.96 mg/kg bw/d to account for the dosing schedule used in the study, as the point of departure. Margins of exposure (MOEs) were 960 and 480 between 0.96 mg/kg bw/d and the average and high dietary exposures, respectively, to furan for the general population, including children. The Committee considered that these MOEs indicate a human health concern for a carcinogenic compound that might act via a DNA-reactive genotoxic metabolite. The furan levels can be reduced in some foods through volatilization (e.g. by heating and stirring canned or jarred foods in an open saucepan).",

A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for furan in rats was developed from gas uptake studies using the initial furan concn of 100, 500, 1050, and 3850 ppm. Tissue partition coefficients for furan were determined in vitro using vial equilibration techniques. Furan gas uptake kinetics in vivo were described by a single saturable process with a V(max) of 27.0 umol/hr/250 g rat and a K(m) of 2.0 uM. Furan metabolism in vivo was inhibited by pyrazole. The furan PBPK model adequately simulated blood and liver furan concn following 4 hr inhalation exposures to 52, 107, and 208 ppm furan. The biotransformation of furan was studied in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes exhibited a K(m) of 0.4 uM and a V(max) of 0.018 umol/hr/1x10(6) cells. Inhibition and induction studies indicated that cytochrome p450 was the catalyst of furan oxidation. ... /This data/ suggests that freshly isolated hepatocytes are a valuable in vitro system for predicting chemical pharmacokinetics in vivo.",

Previous studies indicate that furan is oxidized to a reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated dialdehyde, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial (BDA), in a reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450. Five previously characterized metabolites are derived from the reaction of BDA with cellular nucleophiles such as glutathione and protein. They include the monoglutathione reaction product, N-[4-carboxy-4-(3-mercapto-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1-oxobutyl]-l-cysteinylglycine cyclic sulfide, and its downstream metabolite, S-[1-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl]methylthiol, as well as (R)-2-acetylamino-6-(2,5-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)-1-hexanoic acid and N-acetyl-S-[1-(5-acetylamino-5-carboxypentyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl]-l-cysteine and its sulfoxide. The last two compounds are downstream metabolites of a BDA-derived cysteine-lysine cross-link, S-[1-(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl]-l-cysteine. In this report, ... the characterization of seven additional urinary furan metabolites, all of which are derived from this cross-link /is described/. The cysteinyl residue is subject to several biotransformation reactions, including N-acetylation and S-oxidation. Alternatively, it can undergo beta-elimination followed by S-methylation to a methylthiol intermediate that is further oxidized to a sulfoxide. The lysine portion of the cross-link either is N-acetylated or undergoes a transamination reaction to generate an alpha-ketoacid metabolite that undergoes oxidative decarboxylation. Some of these metabolites are among the most abundant furan metabolites present in urine as judged by LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that the oxidation of furan to BDA and BDA's subsequent reaction with cellular cysteine and lysine residues may represent a significant in vivo pathway of furan biotransformation. Because they are derived from cellular BDA reaction products, these metabolites are markers of furan exposure and bioactivation and could be explored as potential biomarkers in human studies.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Chronic exposure studies ...  using bioassay conditions showed extensive hepatocellular toxicity and sustained increases in regenerative cell proliferation after 1, 3, and 6 wk of treatment in male and female rats and male mice. Altered expression of growth-control genes associated with this hyperproliferative state may enhance the susceptibility of these genes to mutation or may provide a selective growth advantage to preneoplastic cells. Quantitative northern blot analysis of mRNA was used to examine the expression of the oncogenes myc, fos, and Ha-ras in the livers of animals treated with furan. In male rats, a single administration of 30 mg/kg furan produced necrosis and a subsequent wave of cell proliferation 48 hr after treatment and induced transient peaks in the expression of myc, fos, and Ha-ras 6-24 hr after treatment. In male rat liver from our cell proliferation studies, only a slight increase in myc expression was seen at the end of week 1 of treatment. However, beginning at week 3 and increasing at week 6, up to a 15-fold increase over control values was observed in the expression of myc in the treated animals. The only other notable increase in expression observed in any animals from the cell proliferation study was a threefold increase in myc at week 6 in treated female rats. The absence of an increase in Ha-ras expression in the male mouse liver suggests that the unique pattern of Ha-ras mutations previously reported in furan-induced mouse liver tumors is not due to increased mutational susceptibility related to overexpression of this gene. The lack of sustained expression of myc, fos, and Ha-ras in rapidly proliferating liver suggests that continuous expression of these genes is not necessary to maintain increased rates of cell replication. The large increase in myc expression in male but not female rats suggests an adaptive change that may be related to the sex-specific incidence of furan-induced hepatocellular carcinomas in rats.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Large fires: water spray, fog, or alcohol foam. Move container from fire area if this can be accomplished without risk. Spray cooling water on containers that are exposed to flames until well after fire is out. For massive fires in cargo area, use unmanned hose holder or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety device or any discoloration of tank due to fire. Isolate for 1/2 mile in all directions if a tank car or truck is involved. Vapors are heavier than air and will collect in low areas. Vapors may travel long distances to ignition sources and flashback. Vapors in confined areas may explode when exposed to fire. Containers may explode in fire. Storage containers and parts of containers may rocket great distances, in many directions. If material or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Notify local health and fire officials and pollution control agencies. From a secure, explosion-proof location, use water spray to cool exposed containers. If cooling streams are ineffective (venting sound increases in volume and pitch, tank discolors, or shows any signs of deforming), withdraw immediately to a secure position ... The only respirators recommended for fire fighting are self-contained breathing apparatuses that have full facepieces and are operated in a pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode.",

Avoid breathing vapors. Keep upwind. Do not handle broken packages without protective equipment. Wash away any material which may have contacted the body with copious amounts of water or soap and water. Shut off ignition sources; no flares, smoking, or flames in hazard area. Stop leak if you can do so without risk. Use water spray to reduce vapors. Small spills: absorb with sand or other noncombustible absorbent material and place into containers for later disposal. Large spills: dike far ahead of spill for later disposal. The exposure concentration limit of 10 ppm together with the low boiling point of furan requires that adequate ventilation be provided in areas handling this chemical. Establish forced ventilation to keep levels below explosive limit. Contact with liquid must be avoided since this chemical can be absorbed through the skin. Keep furan out of a confined space, such as a sewer, because of the possibility of an explosion, unless the sewer is designed to prevent the build-up of explosive concentrations. Thorough washing with soap and water followed by prolonged rinsing should be done immediately after accidental contact. It may be necessary to contain and dispose of this chemical as a hazardous waste. If material or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Contact your Department of Environmental Protection or your regional office of the federal EPA for specific recommendations.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

A genotoxic mode of action cannot be excluded for furan-induced tumor formation. Furan is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, predominantly CYP2E1, to its major metabolite cis-2-butene-1,4-dial (BDA, maleic dialdehyde), a highly reactive electrophile identified as the key mediator of furan toxicity and carcinogenicity. Furan-mediated effects on glutathione (GSH) levels and cell viability can be suppressed by the CYP inhibitor 1-phenylimidazole and increased by pretreatment of rats with acetone (a CYP2E1-inducing agent), indicating that furan cytotoxicity depends on its metabolic activation. BDA has been shown to react with cellular nucleophiles such as GSH and amino acids and to cause cross-links between thiols and amino groups, giving rise to lactam and pyrrole derivatives. Furan reduced the percentage of DNA in the comet tail in turkey liver fetal hepatocytes. Furan was also shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. A statistically significant increase of micronucleated cells was recently reported in the spleen of furan-treated mice. A reduction of percentage of DNA in comet tail in liver cells was observed following treatment of turkey fetuses in ovo. Exposure to furan at doses associated with increased tumor incidences initially causes hepatocellular necrosis, accompanied by inflammation and sustained regenerative proliferation of hepatocytes, which may present key events in furan-induced hepatocellular carcinogenicity. Subcapsular and centrilobular necrosis accompanied by markedly increased liver enzymes is the primary response to furan treatment. The involvement of inflammatory processes in furan toxicity is also reflected by increased expression of cytokines and other inflammation-associated genes, such as IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and components of the complement system, which may, however, also derive from lesions involving the biliary tract. Indeed, increased production of reactive oxygen species in response to furan is suggested by immunohistochemical detection of 8-oxo-dG within nuclei of hepatocytes of centrilobular areas following high-dose exposure and changes in the expression of genes responsive to oxidative stress in rats and/or mice.

In carbon tetrachloride-poisoned mice, furan nephrotoxicity was augmented. The augmented furan nephrotoxicity was also prevented by diethyldithiocarbamate or carbon disulfide. Thus, furan may exert nephrotoxicity through active metabolites formed in the kidney. Diethyldithiocarbamate and carbon disulfide also protected against hepatotoxicity induced by furan. As an extension of these studies, similar experiments were undertaken with furan, bromobenzene and cephaloridine, and other nephrotoxic agents that are also thought to require metabolic activation. Diethyldithiocarbamate or carbon disulfide prevented mice from suffering renal injury induced by furan and bromobenzene, as evidenced by suppression of elevations in plasma urea nitrogen concentration and kidney calcium content and of morphologic alterations. Cephaloridine nephrotoxicity, however, was not prevented. In carbon tetrachloride-poisoned mice, furan nephrotoxicity was augmented, whereas bromobenzene and cephaloridine nephrotoxicity was suppressed. The augumented furan nephrotoxicity was also prevented by diethyldithiocarbamate or carbon disulfide. These observations suggest that furan, like chloroform and 1,1-dichloroethylene, may exert nephrotoxicity through active metabolites formed in the kidney. For bromobenzene and cephaloridine nephrotoxicity, a renal bioactivation mechanism is suspected. Diethyldithiocarbamate and carbon disulfide also protected against hepatotoxicity induced by furan and thiophene.",

In all, 28 of the subjects exposed to furan resin sand and the control group were evaluated by dynamic spirometry and nitrogen washout. The remaining 11 subjects exposed to furan resin sand were studied using both static and dynamic spirometry and the CO single-breath technique. The time-weighted average exposure to furfuryl alcohol was about 7 mg/cu m, with peak values exceeding the present Swedish short-term exposure limit (40 mg/cu m). The exposure to respirable dust and formaldehyde as time-weighted over the shift was <2 mg/cu m and 0.4 mg/cu m, respectively, in all groups. During the work shift studied, the 28 exposed subjects had more complaints of airway symptoms than did the controls, showing an average decrease of 0.21 in forced vital capacity but no fall in any other lung-function variable. The remaining 11 exposed subjects demonstrated a post-shift decrease in total lung capacity. The results indicate an acute restrictiveness induced by exposure to furan resin sand, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Chronic impairment of lung function was not observed.",

In this study, data on mortality, body weight, organ weight, and clinical and histopathologic signs of toxicity were evaluated.  Clinical signs of toxicity were, for the most part, confined to male and female rats and female mice in the high-dose (60 mg/kg) group. High-dose male and female rats and high-dose (30 mg/kg) male mice had treatment-related reduced rates of body weight gain. In rats, histopathologic examination revealed a dose-related increased severity in liver lesions; lesions observed at the 4 mg/kg dose level were considered \"minimal to mild.\" Measurement of relative organ weights revealed a dose-related increase in liver size in all treated groups of males and in all but the lowest dose (4 mg/kg) groups of female rats. In mice, relative organ weight measurements suggest that treatment-related increases in liver weight occurred in male mice at doses greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg and in females at doses greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg. Upon histopathologic examination, toxic hepatitis of dose-related severity was noted in male mice at doses greater than or equal to 8 mg/kg and in female mice at doses greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg. Doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg/day were without toxic effect.  Examination of the NTP (1982) data indicated that the rat study failed to define a threshold for toxic hepatitis, the major lesion in the target organ for the toxicity of furan. The mouse study (NTP, 1982) indicated a threshold for toxic hepatitis, in that 2 and 4 mg/kg were doses in males at which lesions did not occur; mild lesions of toxic hepatitis occurred at 8 mg/kg. In females, lesions of toxic hepatitis were absent at 8 mg/kg and present at 15 mg/kg. Considering these data together, a dose of 2 mg/kg/day is a reasonable choice for the NOAEL. Since treatment was performed 5 days/week, the 2 mg/kg dose can be transformed to an equivalent dose of 1.4 mg/kg/day. By applying an uncertainty factor of 1000 to the mouse NOAEL of 1.4 mg/kg/day, an oral RfD (ADI) of 1 ug/kg/day or 0.1 mg/day for a 70-kg human can be recommended.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 600 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates furan will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase furan will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone and nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions are 9-10 hours, 4.5-4.6 days and 50 minutes, respectively. If released to soil, furan is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.4X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Furan may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 4% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 8 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, furan is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 hours and 3.3 days, respectively. BCFs of 0.9-1.5 and <3.2-13 measured in fish at furan concentrations of 1 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively, suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since furan lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to furan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where furan is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to furan via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other products containing furan.

Vapor-phase furan is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 to 10 hours, calculated from its rate constants of 3.83X10-11 to 4.23X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec(3-5). Furan will also react with nitrate radicals and ozone radicals in the atmosphere with half-lives of 50 minutes and 4.5 to 4.6 days, calculated from rate constants of 1.4X10-12 cu cm/molecule sec(4) and 2.4X10-18(4) to 2.5X10-18(6), respectively.",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 9 to 10 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). A rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of furan with nitrate radicals was measured as 1.4X10-12 cu cm/molecule sec(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 50 minutes at an atmospheric concentration of 2.4X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of furan with ozone has been measured as 2.4X10-18(2) and 2.5X10-18(4) cu cm/molecule-sec. This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4.5-4.6 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7.2X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). The half-life for the reaction of furan with singlet oxygen in water has been estimated to be 1 hour based on a measured reaction rate constant of 1.4X10+8 L/mole-sec and assuming an ambient singlet oxygen concentration of 1X10-12 mole/L(5). Furan is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(6).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

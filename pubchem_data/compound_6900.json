The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Brain purine, choline and lithium levels were assessed using 1H- and 7Li-MRS. Patients received four to six MRS scans, at baseline and weeks 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 of treatment (n = 40 scans). Patients were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), the Young Mania Rating Scale (YRMS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at each MRS scan. ... There were no significant differences in change-from-baseline measures of CGIS, YMRS, and HDRS, brain choline/creatine ratios, and brain lithium levels over a 12-week assessment period between the choline and placebo groups or within each group. However, the choline treatment group showed a significant decrease in purine metabolite ratios from baseline (purine/n-acetyl aspartate: coef = -0.08, z = -2.17, df = 22, p = 0.030; purine/choline: coef = -0.12, z = -1.97, df = 22, p = 0.049) compared to the placebo group, controlling for brain lithium level changes. Brain lithium level change was not a significant predictor of purine ratios. ... The current study reports that oral choline supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in brain purine levels over a 12-week treatment period in lithium-treated patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder, rapid-cycling type, which may be related to the anti-manic effects of adjuvant choline. This result is consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder inadequately meeting the demand for increased ATP production as exogenous oral choline administration increases membrane phospholipid synthesis.",

Five patients also underwent brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Five of 6 rapid-cycling patients had a substantial reduction in manic symptoms, and 4 patients had a marked reduction in all mood symptoms during choline therapy. The patients who responded to choline all exhibited a substantial rise in the basal ganglia concentration of choline-containing compounds. Choline was well tolerated in all cases. Choline, in the presence of lithium, was a safe and effective treatment for 4 of 6 rapid-cycling patients in our series. A hypothesis is suggested to explain both lithium refractoriness in patients with bipolar disorder and the action of choline in mania, which involves the interaction between phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine second-messenger systems.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Simonsen albino rats were maintained for 36 days on a diet with either normal (4 IU per gram of diet) or excessive retinyl palmitate (RP) (100 or 1000 IU per gram of diet), and normal (2 ug folic acid, 5 mg methionine and 4.2 mg choline bitartrate per gram of diet) or absence of the three dietary factors. CD-1 mouse embryos were exposed to the diet from gestational day 0 to 8, and rat serum from day 8 to 10 during whole embryo culture. The high dose of RP induced 55.4% open anterior neuropores when methylation pathway constituents were included in the diet, but this same retinoid level produced only 12.5% embryos with this defect when these constituents were omitted. Acidic retinoid levels were low in serum (less than 5 ng/mL) via HPLC. Measurements of selected methylation and transsulfuration pathway components did not yield differences in these biochemical intermediates. Thus, dietary folate, choline and methionine facilitate the induction of retinoid-induced neural tube defects.",

A serendipitous finding of urinary calculi in rats fed a semi-synthetic basal diet /is reported/. This observation was made during ongoing studies to evaluate the inhibitory effect of PSC 833, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, on development of tumors in rodent tumor model systems. A large number of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) female Sprague-Dawley and SPF male Fischer 344 rats being fed the diet were euthanized when it became evident clinically that they were uremic. At necropsy, the renal pelvis, ureters, and urinary bladder contained numerous calculi. The presence of urinary calculi was determined to be related to the source of a Food Chemical Codex grade of choline bitartrate. Rats being fed the same basal diet containing the United States Pharmacopia grade of choline bitartrate failed to develop urinary calculi. Interestingly, rats treated with the P-glycoprotein inhibitor were at significantly reduced risk of developing urinary calculi. This finding highlights how something seemingly innocuous as a minor dietary constituent can have a profound impact and, thereby, affect experimental outcome.",

Trimethylaminuria or 'fish odor syndrome' is due to excessive excretion into body fluids and breath of TMA derived from the enterobacterial metabolism of dietary precursors. The disorder is present from birth but becomes apparent as foods containing high amounts of choline or of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from marine (sea or saltwater) fish are introduced into the diet. ... Trimethylaminuria (FMO3 deficiency) in children is rare. ... The dynamics and diagnostic efficacy of choline loading with marine fish meals in six children with trimethylaminuria /were compared/. Loading with a marine fish meal provides a simple and acceptable method for confirmation of diagnosis of suspected trimethylaminuria in children, with the effects being cleared more quickly than with a choline load test. However, oral loading with choline bitartrate allows estimation of residual oxidative capacity in vivo and is a useful adjunct to molecular studies. Patients homozygous for the 'common' P153L mutation in the FMO3 gene showed virtual complete lack of residual TMA N-oxidative capacity, consistent with a nonfunctional or absent FMO3 enzyme, whereas a patient with the M82T mutation showed some residual oxidative capacity. A patient compound heterozygous for two novel mutations, G193E and R483T, showed considerable residual N-oxidative capacity. A further patient, heterozygous for two novel sequence variations in the FMO3 gene, consistently showed malodor and elevated urinary TMA/TMAO ratios under basal conditions but a negative response to both choline and marine fish meal loading. Comparison of the effects of administration of antibiotics (metronidazole, amoxicillin, neomycin) on gut bacterial production of trimethylamine from choline showed they all reduced TMA production to a limited extent, with neomycin being most effective. 'Best-practice' diagnostic and treatment guidelines are summarized.",

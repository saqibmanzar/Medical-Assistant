The compound is not normally encountered in the anhydrous form, but rather as the hydrate (acetal), ClCH2CH(OH)2. Chloroacetaldehyde is a useful intermediate in the synthesis, e.g. of 2-aminothiazole or many pharmaceutical compounds. Another use is to facilitate bark removal from tree trunks.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

We have shown that, whereas chloroacetaldehyde is cardiotoxic at doses above 2 mg/kg b.w., this toxic effect is not accompanied by an increase in intramyocardial citrate levels. Chloroacetate, its main metabolite, is not cardiotoxic. The metabolism of chloroacetaldehyde is complex and leads, in addition to chloroethanol, glycolic acid, conjugates of glutathione with chloroacetate or chloroethanol (and/or their metabolites, S-(2-carboxymethyl) cysteine, N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxymethyl) cysteine, S-(2-hydroxymethyl)cysteine) and thiodiglycolic acid. Low amounts of chloroacetate are metabolized by isolated perfused rabbit hearts into glycolic acid and glutathione conjugate (and/or its metabolites, S-(2-carboxymethyl) cysteine, N-acetyl-S-(2-carboxymethyl)cysteine). ...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

After trimethylsilylation, products were analyzed by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Reaction of 3-methyluridine with 2-chloroacetaldehyde indicated that it can react with both the 3-methyluracil and ribose moieties. Molecular ions suggest that 2-chloroacetaldehyde attaches a 1-hydroxy-2-chloroethyl group to the 3-methyluracil moiety. 2-Chloroacetaldehyde not only formed etheno derivatives and oxoethyl adducts, respectively, but also yielded other types of adducts with nucleic acids. 2-Chloroacetaldehyde reacted with free nucleosides or single stranded nucleic acids to yield cyclic etheno derivatives. Model nucleosides (cytosine or uracil) in which the most nucleophilic site (the N-3 position) was blocked by a methyl group were treated with 2-chloroacetaldehyde to investigate whether these adducts are formed in native DNA. GC/MS analyses suggested that 2-chloroacetaldehyde can add a 2-chlorovinyl group to 3-methylcytosine.",

Concentrated aqueous solutions of chloroacetaldehyde are obtained in nearly quantitative yields by the reaction of chlorine with vinyl acetate in water at room temperature. As an intermediate 1,2-dichloroethyl acetate is formed, which is quantitatively hydrolyzed at elevated temperatures. The resulting solution is purified by distillation.",

Plasma levels of CA in IFA-treated cancer patients are often difficult to determine due to the lack of a sufficiently sensitive and specific analytical method. /The authors/ have developed a simple and sensitive HPLC method with fluorescence detection to measure CA formation catalyzed by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, either in vivo in IFA-injected rats or in vitro in liver microsomal incubations. This method is based on the formation of the highly fluorescent adduct 1-N(6)-ethenoadenosine from the reaction of CA with adenosine (10 mM) at pH 4.5 upon heating at 80 degrees C for 2 hr. The derivatization mixture is directly injected onto a C18 HPLC column and is monitored with a fluorescence detector. Calibration curves are linear (r > 0.999) over a wide range of CA concentrations (5-400 pmol). The limit of detection of CA in plasma using this method is <0.1 uM and only 50 uL of plasma is required for the assay. By coupling this method with a recently described HPLC-fluorescent method to determine acrolein, a cytochrome P450 metabolite of IFA formed during the activation of the drug by 4-hydroxylation, the two major, alternative P450-catalyzed pathways of IFA metabolism can be monitored from the same plasma samples or liver microsomal incubations and the partitioning of drug between these two pathways thereby quantitated. This assay may prove to be useful for studies of IFA metabolism aimed at identifying factors that contribute to individual differences in CA formation and in developing approaches to minimize CA formation while maximizing IFA cytotoxicity.",

If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

DNA polymerase fingerprint analysis was used to study the distribution of CAA-induced modifications in the p53 sequence. A plasmid bearing cDNA containing the human p53 gene was reacted in vitro with CAA, then dehydrated for conversion of hydroxyethano into etheno adducts, and primer extension by T7 DNA polymerase in the presence of four dNTPs was performed. The DNA repair enzymes methylpurine-DNA glycosylase and Escherichia coli exonuclease III were used to convert epsilon A residues in the template into DNA strand breaks, which enabled precise localization of the epsilon A residues within the p53 gene. Hydroxyethano derivatives of adenine and cytosine in a template blocked T7 DNA polymerase and caused premature chain termination opposite adenine or one base before cytosine. After dehydration, both epsilon A and epsilon C were much more easily by-passed by T7 DNA polymerase. Formation of epsilon G was identified as 'stop bands' one base before guanine residues. Modification of cytosine and guanine was additionally recognized by weakening or disappearance of non-specific stops on an undamaged template, probably due to steric hindrance by the tertiary DNA structure for polymerase. Etheno adduction of cytosine and guanine relaxed the compact DNA structure and enabled DNA polymerase to by-pass. In exons 5-8 of p53, 143 out of 500 sites appeared to be damaged by CAA, with four particularly densely modified regions between codons 135-147, 218-222, 234-255 and 284-292. The pattern of modification followed the pattern of p53 mutations found in vinyl chloride-associated liver angiosarcomas in humans and rats, but only in regions that showed 100% homology with the human sequence. ...",

To further understand the roles of CEO and CAA in VC mutagenesis, the types and frequencies of mutations induced at the hypoxanthine (guanine) phosphoribosyl-transferase (hprt) locus were examined in a human B-lymphoblastoid line constitutively expressing human cytochrome P450 2E1 (H2E1 cells). VC was toxic and mutagenic to H2E1 cells as a function of incubation time; exposure to 7.5% VC in air resulted in 75% survival and an hprt mutant frequency of 42 x 10(-6) after 48 hr, compared to 5.7 +/- 2.7 x 10(-6) for unexposed cells. The exposure of H2E1 cells to 0.8 to 15.0% VC in air produced similar mutant frequencies without a clear dose-response relationship, suggesting saturation of metabolic activation. Both CEO and CAA exhibited dose-dependent increases in cell killing and mutant frequency in H2E1 cells. Treatment with 16 uM CEO for 24 hr resulted in 75% survival and an induced mutant frequency of 23 x 10(-6), while 16 uM CAA produced 5% survival and an induced mutant frequency of 20 x 10(-6). Structural alterations at the hprt locus in independent thioguanine-resistant clones were examined by Southern blot analysis of Pst I-digested DNA with a full-length human hprt cDNA probe. Ten percent (5/50) of VC-induced and 18% (7/38) of CEO-induced mutants showed detectable deletions, compared with 45% (9/20) of CAA-induced mutants. Thus, VC and CEO displayed similar toxicity/mutation profiles and a similar frequency of large deletions, whereas CAA displayed greater toxicity and a larger frequency of deletion mutations. These results suggest that the majority of mutations induced by VC occur through its metabolite, CEO.",

No unexposed control animals were present. During exposure the relative humidity was relatively high (51-91%), partly due to the high amount of water in the test material. After the 1-hr exposure, the animals were observed for up to two weeks. The observations were generally reported without always specifying the number of animals and the regarding exposure concentrations. Shortly after the start of exposure, the rats were restless and showed signs of discomfort (closed eyes, salivation, and, in the higher dose groups, wet nares and nasal discharge along with wet and soiled heads and breasts). In the highest dose group (2643 ppm), labored respiration accompanied by dyspnea and mouth breathing was detected in all animals. Mortality rates of 0% (44 ppm), 30% (159 ppm), 40% (203 ppm), and 100% (>/=243 ppm) were found. Many of the rats that died (>/=159 ppm) had bloodstains around the nose and mouth. Rats exposed to the highest chloroacetaldehyde concentrations that did not die immediately were reported to have breathed \"wheezingly\". Two rats exposed to 596 ppm became blind. No chloroacetaldehyde-induced effects were seen on body weight, although two animals at 159 and 203 ppm lost weight considerably. The animals that died during exposure or within the first 2 days of observation showed edema of the lungs which was accompanied in some cases by atelectasis and in most cases by hydrothorax. The latter finding could be explained by an induced hypertension. Lung edema was also observed in some animals of the three lowest concentration groups that were killed at the end of the observation period. The effects on the lung pointed to an impairment of lung functioning. In many cases, the stomachs were found to be filled with air due to mouth breathing and in some cases the intestines were also found to contain air. Also an occasional thrombus was detected in the heart area.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 64.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloroacetaldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloroacetaldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.3 days. Chloroacetaldehyde does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chloroacetaldehyde is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Chloroacetaldehyde may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of chloroacetaldehyde may be an important environmental fate process, based on its degradation to glycollic acid by Pseudomonas CE1r that was isolated from soil. If released into water, chloroacetaldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 35 hours and 13 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based upon a hydrolysis rate of 2X10-6 to 5X10-6/hr at 37 \u00b0C. Occupational exposure to chloroacetaldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chloroacetaldehyde is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to chloroacetaldehyde via ingestion of treated drinking water. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase chloroacetaldehyde is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.3 days, calculated from its rate constant of 3.1X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec(3). Chloroacetaldehyde does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

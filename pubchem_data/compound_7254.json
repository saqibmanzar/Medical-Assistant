When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

Partial least squares analysis has been used to predict the partition coefficient for octanol/water, log P, for chlorinated alkylbenzenes. This investigation revealed that various of the physicochemical parameters considered were highly correlated with the partition coefficient and that partial least square models based on global, direct or autocorrelated substituent parameters all seem to be adequate for prediction of log P, as compared to results obtained experimentally or by means of standard substituent calculation schemes. However, the use of autocorrelation vectors of connectivity, steric and electronic effects may be preferably due to a high degree of explanation of the molecular descriptor variance.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Exposure to 2,4-dichlorotoluene may occur via inhalation or dermal routes, primarily resulting from occupational activities including those associated with its use as a high boiling solvent and as an intermediate in organic synthesis. Because it is a strong irritant, personnel involved with 2,4-dichlorotoluene should wear boots, protective gloves, and goggles, at a minimum. Avoid breathing vapor or, to enter a contaminated area freely, wear full face mask self-contained breathing apparatus which provides eye protection. Broken packages containing 2,4-dichlorotoluene should not be handled without protective equipment. Any of this material which contacts the body must be washed away with copious amounts of water. While substance must be moderately heated before ignition occurs (flashpoint: 199 \u00b0F, open cup), 2,4-dichlorotoluene is, nevertheless, considered a combustion hazard. Normal fire fighting procedures may be employed, which includes the use of \"alcohol\" foam, or dry chemical extinguishing agents. Water also may be used in flooding quantities as a fog or spray (solid streams may be ineffective) to extinguish the fire or cool containers. Application of water should be from as far a distance as possible. This substance is considered to be normally stable, even under fire exposure conditions. Nonetheless, it should be stored away from sparks, flames, or other sources ignition. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. If 2,4-dichlorotoluene spills, keep material out of water sources and sewers; building dikes to contain the flow as necessary. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

The acute toxicity to Photobacterium phosphoreum (Microtox test) of a set of 80 chlorinated compounds, containing aliphatics, benzenes, toluenes, phenols and anilines, was investigated using 'Theoretical Linear Solvation Energy Relationship' parameters. Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships were developed for chemical and toxicological subsets. Molecular volume revealed to be the most important Theoretical Linear Solvation Energy Relationship descriptor. For the complete data set and for the phenols the Theoretical Linear Solvation Energy Relationship descriptors are superior to log P alone. In the case of the phenols this is related to electronic information being inherent in the electrostatic parameter q-, which is correlated to the pKa of the compounds. For the benzenes a quadratic term in Vmc was very useful for the description of the toxicity, Many of the chlorinated aliphatics do not fit the narcosis II Quantitative Structural Activity Relationship. Enhanced chemical reactivity due to the chlorine substitution may lead to activation or biodegradation of these compounds. The attempt to establish narcosis II Quantitative Structural Activity Relationships for the polar narcotic chloroanilines and -phenols was unsuccessful. It seems that some chloroanilines interact directly with the bioluminescence system of P. phosphoreum. The authors emphasize that the concept of baseline narcosis implies that the pure narcosis II mechanism decreases with increasing log P. The site of toxic action for narcosis II is therefore thought to be hydrophilic. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation seems to play a minor role in the photobacterium than it does in fish. Reasons for this may be the ability of bacteria to crack and detoxify aromatic rings or the relative robustness of oxidative phosphorylation in bacteria.",

Published in vivo LC50 values were identified for 11 of the 18 test agents and, with the exception of 2,4-dinitrophenol, there was a good correlation between the in vitro cytotoxicity of the test agents and their in vivo waterborne acute toxicity. The potencies of the substituted phenolics and chlorinated toluenes as determined by the in vitro cytotoxicity assay correlated strongly with their log octanol/water partition coefficients (log P). However, the toxicity of 2,3-dinitrotoluene in vitro, and apparently also in vivo, was not a function of its log P value.",

Extraction with hexane and ethyl ether-hexane (1 + 1) was followed by concentration over steam, and gas chromatographic analysis with an electron capture detector. Volatile compounds were analyzed in a glass column coated with 6% SP-2100 plus 4% OV-ll on Chromosorb W. Semivolatile compounds, chlorinated compounds and pesticides were analyzed in a 70 m glass capillary column coated with 5% OV-101. Phenols were analyzed in a glass column packed with 1% SP-1240 DA on Supelcoport. The most efficient means of separation was to use the same glass column for volatile compounds, a DB-5 fused silica capillary column for semivolatile compounds, pesticides and phenols, and the same 1% SP-1240 DA glass column for separation of beta-BHC and pentachlorophenol. Recoveries ranged from 86.3 + or - 9.1% (mean + or - SD) to 105 + or - 10.4%. Sensitivities for semivolatile chlorinated compounds, pesticides and phenols were 4 ng/g for fat, 1 ng/g for tissue and 0.2 ng/ml for blood. Sensitivities for volatile compounds were 4-fold higher (16, 4 and 0.8, respectively). Sensitivities for dichlorobenzenes and dichlorotoluenes were 8 ng/g for fat, 2 ng/g for tissue and 0.4 ng/ml for blood.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2,4-dichlorotoluene should exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere based on a measured vapor pressure of 0.458 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2,4-dichlorotoluene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of about 12 days. An estimated Koc of 4,800 suggests that 2,4-dichlorotoluene may have slight mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-3 atm cu m/mol. 2,4-Dichlorotoluene was found to be susceptible to anaerobic biodegradation in soil slurry microcosms under methanogenic conditions; complete degradation required 130 days. The predominant product of this reaction was 4-chlorotoluene, a small amount of 2-chlorotoluene was also produced. 2,4-Dichlorotoluene is expected to adsorb to suspended matter in the water based on its estimated Koc value. This compound should volatilize from water surfaces given its Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 1000 suggests that 2,4-dichlorotoluene may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. (SRC)",

Based on limited data, this compound may biodegrade under anaerobic conditions(SRC). 2,4-Dichlorotoluene was found to be susceptible to anaerobic biodegradation in soil slurry microcosms under methanogenic conditions; complete degradation required 130 days(3). The predominant product of this reaction was 4-chlorotoluene, a small amount of 2-chlorotoluene was also produced(3). 2,4-Dichlorotoluene may volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.2X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively(1,SRC), although adsorption to sediment or suspended material in water may attenuate this process(SRC). An estimated BCF value of 1000(1,SRC), from a measured log Kow(2), suggests that 2,4-dichlorotoluene will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC), according to a recommended classification scheme(5). The half-life of 2,4-dichlorotoluene in the Rhine River in The Netherlands is 1 day as determined by measuring concentration differences over a reach of the river(6,SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Equilibrium partitioning theory was used to derive no effect levels for aquatic sedments and internal toxicant concentrations for aquatic organisms. A simple table is given from which no effect levels for narcotic chemicals for water, sediment, and residues in biota can be predicted on the basis of only the octanol/water partition coefficient and molecular weight. The method may be applied to setting quality criteria for the aquatic environment and to ecotoxicological interpretation of (bio)monitoring data. Calculations were carried out for 102 narcotic compounds.",

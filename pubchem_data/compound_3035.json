Acute, oral exposure to high doses of DDT in humans results in central nervous system (CNS) effects, such as headaches, nausea, and convulsions. The only effect noted in epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to DDT and other pesticides was an increase in activity of liver enzymes. Animal studies have reported effects on the liver, immune system, and CNS from chronic oral exposure to DDT. Human studies are inconclusive regarding DDE and cancer. Animal studies have reported an increased incidence of liver tumors in mice and hamsters, and thyroid tumors in female rats from oral exposure to DDE. EPA has classified DDE as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Thus one is left with two alternatives to explain the phenomenon: 1) the carbonic anhydrase in the shell gland of avian species is unusually sensitive to chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides, or 2) the in vivo inhibition observed is a result of some other effect, such as reduced enzyme production or the production of substances that suppress the activity of the enzyme.",

Acute, oral exposure to high doses of DDT in humans results in central nervous system (CNS) effects, such as headaches, nausea, and convulsions. The only effect noted in epidemiologic studies of workers exposed to DDT and other pesticides was an increase in activity of liver enzymes. Animal studies have reported effects on the liver, immune system, and CNS from chronic oral exposure to DDT. Human studies are inconclusive regarding DDE and cancer. Animal studies have reported an increased incidence of liver tumors in mice and hamsters, and thyroid tumors in female rats from oral exposure to DDE.

Precautions against these potential effects include the wearing of protective clothing and gloves, and the use of dust or gas masks, or combined respirators. Protect from exposure, persons with liver disease. DDE will not ignite easily, but it will burn with the potential to emit irritating or poisonous gases. For small fires involving DDE, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, or foam, and for large fires, use water spray, fog, or foam. Runoff from fire control water may give off poisonous gases or cause water pollution and should, therefore, be diked for later disposal. Small spills of DDE should be carefully shovelled into a clean, dry container for later disposal, (liquid DDE is first absorbed by a non-combustible material, eg, sand) for later disposal. Before permanent land disposal of DDE, consult with environmental regulatory agencies.",

DDE reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDE inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDE inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDE also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDE is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)",

The findings suggest a possible carcinogenic effect of TDE in male Osborne-Mendel rats, based on the induction of combined follicular-cell carcinomas and follicular-cell adenomas of the thyroid. Because of the variation of these tumors in control male rats in this study, the evidence does not permit a more conclusive interpretation of these lesions. p,p'-DDE was carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, causing hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes.",

The effects of the perinatal, combined exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and p,p'-DDE on the female reproductive system have been investigated in mature rat female offspring of dams ingesting 25 ppm.

Sexual maturation was fully developed in the rat female offspring perinatally exposed to DCB and/or p,p'-DDE through maternal exposure. The combined effect of DCB and p,p'-DDE was observed, and the ovarian weight was seen to decrease to approximately 80% of the control rat in matured female offspring following perinatal exposure to DCB and p,p'-DDE. This alteration might lead to reproductive dysfunction in matured female offspring...",

Aspirate oral and pharyngeal secretion, and when possible, insert an oropharyngeal airway to maintain an open passage unobstructed by the tongue. Minimize noise and any manipulation of the patient that may trigger seizure activity. Seizures in patients caused by organochlorine toxicity are likely to be prolonged and difficult to control. Status epilepticus is common. For this reason, patients with seizures that do not respond immediately to anticonvulsants should be transferred as soon as possible to a trauma center and will generally require intensive care admission until seizures are controlled and neurologic status is improved.

Methods: The cohort was established in the early 1990s and followed through 2005. We tested serum for DDE and PCB congeners and assessed diabetes diagnosis, demographics, and fish consumption. Associations of diabetes with exposures were examined prospectively in participants without diabetes in 1994-1995, followed through 2005. Annual percent changes in DDE and PCB-132/153 from 1994 to 2005 were examined by diabetes status.  DDE exposure was associated with incident diabetes. Incident diabetes was not associated with mono-ortho PCB-118, total PCBs, or years of sport fish consumption. Annual percent change in DDE and PCB-132/153 did not differ significantly by diabetes status. This study demonstrates an association between DDE exposure and incident diabetes. The findings of an association of DDE with incident diabetes and the lack of effect of diabetes on annual percent change in POPs do not support the hypothesis that associations of POPs with diabetes are attributable to reverse causality. Additional studies should address the biological pathways by which DDE could affect glucose homeostasis.",

To study the relationship of POP exposure to TGCT risk, prediagnostic serum samples from 754 case subjects and 928 control subjects enrolled in the Servicemen's Testicular Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants Study were analyzed for cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor, oxychlordane, total chlordanes, beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, mirex, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of TGCT overall and for the histological subgroups, seminoma and nonseminoma, were estimated...  TGCT risk was statistically significantly associated with higher plasma levels of p,p'-DDE (for highest quartile [Q4] vs lowest quartile [Q1], OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.38, P(trend) = .0002) and of two chlordane components, cis-nonachlor (Q4 vs Q1, OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.11 to 2.18, P(trend) = .009) and trans-nonachlor (Q4 vs Q1, OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.07 to 2.00, P(trend) = .026).

Pregnant women who enrolled in the Collaborative Perinatal Project (United States, 1959-1965) were asked about their previous pregnancy history; blood samples were drawn and the serum frozen. In 1997-1999, the sera of 1717 of these women who had previous pregnancies were analyzed for DDE, the major breakdown product of DDT. The odds of previous fetal loss was examined in relation to DDE level in logistic regression models. Compared with women whose DDE level was <15 ug/L, the adjusted odds ratios of fetal loss according to category of DDE were as follows: 15-29 ug/L, 1.1; 30-44 ug/L, 1.4; 45-59 ug/L, 1.6; and 60+ ug/L, 1.2. The adjusted odds ratio per 60 ug/L increase was 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1-1.6). The results were consistent with an adverse effect of DDE on fetal loss, but were inconclusive owing to the possibility that previous pregnancies ending in fetal loss decreased serum DDE levels less than did those carried to term.",

About 10 mg/kg DDE had been daily administered for 28 days from 48 weeks to 52 weeks of age and its effects were observed subsequently. The administration of DDE did not give rise to any overt signs of toxicity. Male reproductive organs were not affected and serum biochemistry was not impaired at the dose of this experiment. Organ weights of the liver and spleen slightly increased and the thymus weight reduced with DDE administration. Serum total cholesterol and free T4 levels slightly decreased with DDE administration, albeit statistically insignificant. The results indicated that even aged male rats were resistant to DDE exposure at the daily dose of ca. 10 mg/kg.",

DDT, DDE, and DDD were each found to be pure phenobarbital-type cytochrome P450 inducers in the male F344/NCr rat, causing induction of hepatic CYP2B and CYP3A, but not CYP1A. The ED50 values for CYP2B induction (benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation) by DDT, DDE, and DDD were, respectively, 103, 88, and > or = 620 ppm in diet (14 days of exposure). The efficacies (Emax values) for induction of benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation by DDT, DDE, and DDD were 24-, 22-, and > or = 1-fold, respectively, compared to control values. The potencies of the three congeners for CYP2B induction appeared also to be similar, with EC50 values (based on total serum DDT equivalents) of 1.5, 1.8, and > or = 0.51 uM, respectively.",

Each cmpd was admin in the feed, at either of two concn, to groups of 50 male and 50 female animals of each species. Twenty animals of each species and sex were placed on test as controls for the bioassay of each cmpd. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concn of DDT were, respectively, 642 and 321 ppm for male rats, 420 and 210 ppm for female rats, 44 and 22 ppm for male mice, and 175 and 87 ppm for female mice. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concn of TDE were, respectively, 3294 and 1647 ppm for male rats, 1700 and 850 ppm for female rats, and 822 and 411 ppm for male and female mice. The time weighted avg high and low dietary concn of DDE were, respectively, 839 and 437 ppm for male rats, 462 and 242 ppm for female rats, and 261 and 148 ppm for male and female mice. After the 78 wk dosing period there was an additional observation period of up to 35 wk for rats and 15 wk for mice. ... Under the conditions of these bioassays there was no evidence for the carcinogenicity of DDT in Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice, of TDE in female Osborne-Mendel rats or B6C3F1 mice of either sex, or p,p'-DDE in Osborne-Mendel rats, although p,p'-DDE was hepatotoxic in Osborne-Mendel rats. The findings suggest a possible carcinogenic effect of TDE in male Osborne-Mendel rats, based on the induction of combined follicular cell carcinomas and follicular cell adenomas of the thyroid. Because of the variation of these tumors in control male rats in this study, the evidence does not permit a more conclusive interpretation of these lesions. p,p'-DDE was carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, causing hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: For p,p'-DDE: Male Rats: Negative, Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Positive; Female Mice: Positive. For DDT: Male Rats: Negative; Female Rats: Negative: Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative. For TDE: Male Rats: Equivocal; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Negative; Female Mice: Negative.",

DDT homologue and PCB congener levels were determined and compared to levels in eggs collected from other breeding areas on Lake Maggiore and in a presumably less contaminated area on Lake Garda. Although Lake Garda eggs on average possessed a lower level of p,p'-DDE than Lake Maggiore eggs, they had significantly higher levels of PCBs and could not be used as a reference population for the measurement of eggshell thickness. Nevertheless, a negative linear relationship was found between p,p'-DDE concentration and eggshell thickness for eggs collected from both lakes, indicating a possible causal relationship. Testosterone and 17beta-estradiol concentrations were also determined for eggs collected from both lakes in 2004. Average concentrations of both hormones were the lowest in eggs from Lake Maggiore; however, the very high variability within broods did not result in any significant difference between the lakes.",

Among passerines, it is not known whether organochlorine contaminants in eggs within the same clutch are independent observations or follow a laying order effect. Intraclutch variation of DDE concentrations was studied in eggs collected from prothonotary warblers (Protonotaria citrea) and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) nesting on National Priority List sites in lower Alabama and central Colorado, respectively. All 209 eggs collected for this study contained detectable levels of DDE. Mean concentration of DDE across all prothonotary warbler eggs (mean 8.71 ug/g +/- 1.19, n = 20) was almost two orders of magnitude greater than mean concentrations of DDE in all starling eggs (mean 0.70 ug/g +/- 0.06, n = 189). In both species, there was a large amount of variability among individual eggs of the same clutch and no significant relationship between laying order and DDE concentration. Variation among eggs laid in the same sequential order was high and effectively masked any potential trends in laying order effect...  DDE levels in a single egg collected for analysis do not consistently reflect DDE levels in the eggs remaining in the nest."

Apple orchards sprayed with pesticides in current use and reference sites were chosen for study in southern Ontario, Canada, during 2000-2001. Thyroid hormone concentrations (plasma and muscle thyroxine [T4], and triiodothyronine [T3]) and the response to a challenge with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as parameters of thyroid histology /were assessed/. Individual nests were exposed to as many as seven individual pesticide applications and up to five pesticide mixtures. Concentrations of p,p'-DDE in eggs from both species were highest in orchard sites, and ranged from 0.05 to 5.44 mg/kg wet weight for tree swallows, and from 0.17 to 95.4 mg/kg for eastern bluebirds. In 2000, tree swallows from sprayed orchards had elevated plasma T4 concentrations, and thyroid glands with collapsed follicles, hypertrophic epithelia, and higher follicular epithelial cells relative to chicks from reference sites. Plasma T4 concentration was positively correlated with the total number of pesticide mixtures applied during egg incubation through chick rearing. In 2001, basal plasma T3 concentration in tree swallow chicks did not differ between orchard and reference sites, though there were differences among orchards; T3 was positively correlated with total number of individual sprays applied during egg incubation through chick rearing. Tree swallows challenged with TSH showed no significant difference in thyroid hormone concentration or follicular epithelial cell height between exposure groups; however, a significantly greater proportion of chicks from reference sites were found to have thyroids with focal or diffuse hypertrophic epithelia relative to orchard chicks. In 2001, bluebirds from sprayed orchards had significantly higher T3 concentrations in response to TSH challenge; this response was positively correlated with the total number of pesticides applied during egg incubation through chick rearing.",

                                                    "String": "DDE, (2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene) is an impurity and a degradation product of the formerly manufactured and used pesticide DDT, (2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane); therefore, DDE has been directly released to the environment as a result of the use of DDT as an insecticide. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates DDE will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase DDE will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Particulate-phase DDE will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. DDE may undergo direct photolysis in the environment since it absorbs light greater than 290 nm; DDE adsorbed on silica gel and irradiated with wavelengths >290 nm for 7 days was 20% photomineralized. If released to soil, DDE is expected to be immobile based upon measured Koc values of 26,300 and 75,860. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.16X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. DDE is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its vapor pressure. DDE was less than 1% mineralized in flooded soils during a 42 day incubation period, suggesting biodegradation in soil is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, DDE is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the Koc data. Biodegradation of DDE in water is not expected to be an important process; no degradation of DDE exposed to ocean sediments in seawater under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was observed after a 12 month incubation period. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.8 and 18 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 5 years when adsorption is considered. BCF values of 27,500 to 81,000 measured in fish suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. The hydrolysis rate of DDE under environmental conditions is very slow, with a reported half-life of 120 years at 27 \u00b0C and pH 3-5. Occupational exposure and general population exposure should be low or non-existent since DDT is no longer produced or used in the US (1972). However, monitoring data indicate that the general population continues to be exposed to DDE due to its long persistence time; although concentrations are continuously decreasing, data continues to show levels of DDT, DDD and DDE in environmental media. The general population may be exposed to DDE primarily via ingestion of food, and also via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces may be expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.16X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.8 and 18 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 5 years if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values of 27,500 to 81,000 measured in fish(8-10) suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). Hydrolysis of DDE is expected to occur very slowly under environmental conditions; a half-life of 120 years at 27 \u00b0C and pH 3-5 was reported under acidic conditions(11). No degradation of DDE exposed to ocean sediments in seawater under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were observed after 12 months(12) indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 1.8 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 18 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 5 years if adsorption is considered(3). DDE's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur; however adsorption is expected to attenuate this process(SRC). DDE is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 6X10-6 mm Hg(4).",

DDE was detected in brains of big brown bats at RMA in the following sexes, at geometric mean (ranges) concentrations in ug/g wet weight: males, 0.23 (0.11-1.6); females, 0.1 (0.10-1.4); juveniles, 0.15 (0.10-0.67); in a maternity roost: juveniles, 0.24 (not detected-0.45); at Fort Collins reference location: males, 0.07 (0.11-0.17); females, 0.08 (0.10-0.27); juveniles, 0.09 (0.10-0.23)(1). From 1998 to 1999, DDE was detected in all Brazilian Free-tailed bat guano and dermestid beetle samples collected from East Texas, with concns ranging between 0.001-0.015 ug/g and 0.001-0.006 ug/g, respectively(2). DDE was detected in the blubber of an Antarctic Weddell seal at a concn of 8.8 ug/kg wet weight(3). In 2001, the mean concn (in ng/g lipid weight) of p,p'-DDE detected in the liver and muscle of racoon dogs from Japan was 58 (range of 5.3-150) and 24 (range of 2.0-59), respectively(4). DDE was detected in tissue from mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) in August 1997 from Sequoia National Park and Kings Canyon National Park, CA, at mean (median) concns of 45.69 (46.72) and 16.96 (19.34) ng/g wet weight, respectively(5).",

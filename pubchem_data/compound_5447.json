The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Four IPPSFs were topically dosed with 2.85 mg of 14C-HD in ethanol. Venous perfusate samples were collected and added to a 34% solution of NaCl and snap-frozen to inhibit the metabolism of HD until time for assay. Perfusate samples were extracted using a solid-phase extraction cartridge with ethyl acetate and then assayed using gas chromatography. Two of the 4 IPPSFs showed detectable levels of HD in the venous perfusate 15 min after dosing, with 1 of these 2 IPPSFs showing detectable levels of HD in the perfusate 2 hours after dosing. All 4 IPPSFS had no more than 3 metabolites of HD appearing in the perfusate throughout the 2 hr experiment, with one of the these metabolites identified as thiodiglycol. These experiments showed that little, if any, HD appears in the venous perfusate intact after percutaneous absorption and that epidermal metabolism of HD does occur to a significant degree in the IPPSF.",

In this case higher background levels (up to 3ng/mL) were observed, consistent with the sulfoxide being the major excretion product of the two metabolites. The method was applied to urine samples, stored frozen for 13 years, from two casualties of accidental mustard poisoning. Levels of thiodiglycol were 1 and 3 ng/mL, which increased to 78 and 104 ng/mL after treatment of the urine with titanium trichloride.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Related work showed an increase in the rate of NAD (but not NADP) reduction upon the addition of thiodiglycol to mouse liver cytosol. This result provided evidence that metabolism beyond thiodiglycol may be contributing to protein phosphatase inhibition. This observation indicated that metabolism involving one or more dehydrogenases may be necessary to produce the ultimate inhibitor of the protein phosphatases. /The authors/ report here that thiodiglycol is a substrate for horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (Km = 3.68+/-0.45 mM and Vmax = 0.22 +/-0.01 umol/ min/ mg protein) and for pyridine nucleotide-linked enzymes in mouse liver and human skin cytosol. The alcohol dehydrogenase-specific inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole inhibited the oxidation of thiodiglycol by the pure horse liver enzyme as well as by the enzymes in human skin and mouse liver cytosol, indicating that the activity in the tissue preparations is also alcohol dehydrogenase.",

The lack of a UV chromophore of target analytes was overcome by derivatization with phthalic anhydride. The reactant concentrations, as well as the derivatization dependence on heating temperature and time, were carefully investigated. The baseline separation of three derivatives was achieved in less than 8 min by applying a simple BGE composed of a 30 mM borate buffer at pH 8.5. Several parameters affecting the separation efficiency (buffer pH and concentration, capillary temperature, and applied voltage) were evaluated. Calibration curves of all compounds showed good linear correlations (R(2) > 0.9994). The LODs of the TDG and its oxidation products were in the range of 98-154 ng/mL. The precision tests resulted in RSDs for migration times and peak areas of less than 1.2 and 3.6%, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied for the analysis of TDG and oxidation products in seawater, utilizing the carbon aerogel-based adsorbents for sample purification and concentration. Additionally, the method has the potential to be transformed into a portable CE format.",

After elution in 2 mm o.d. NMR tubes (1)H NMR spectra were recorded. Recoveries vary from 43 +/- 5 for I to 102 +/- 5% for VI and are limited by volume breakthrough. The detection limits of the LC-SPE NMR method vary between 200 ng for V and 450 ng for I. Increasing the injection volume is shown to be more effective than multiple trapping for the analytes I-VIII to increase the amount of material trapped on the SPE cartridges. The applicability of the developed method to the analysis of environmental samples was tested by the analysis of sample 293 provided by the 29th Official OPCW (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) Proficiency Test. The chromatographic and (1)H NMR data obtained by the method are highly reproducible and provide acceptable data for the identification of chemicals related to CWC (Chemical Weapons Convention) in case an off-site analysis for the verification of the CWC or OPCW Proficiency Tests according to the OPCW criteria for the acceptance of chromatographic and (1)H NMR spectral data.",

Quantitation of TDG was performed by measuring the respective peak area on the extracted ion chromatogram of m/z 293, using an internal standard, the TDG homologue, thiodipropanol, peak area of which was measured as m/z 321. The presence of salts in the sample solution not only suppressed the loss of TDG by vaporization during the evaporation of water, but also facilitated the rate of production of di-silylated derivative, bis(tert-butyldimethylsilyoxylethyl)sulfide (TDG-(TBDMS)2). Under the pretreatment conditions used, in which 0.5 mL of water sample supplemented with 100 uM potassium chloride was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, followed by reaction with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide at 60 degrees C for 1 hr, TDG-(TBDMS)2 was reproducibly detected with about a 55% recovery and a limit of detection (LOD, scan mode, S/N = 3) of 5.4 ng/mL. TDG was also determined by GC-MS from a 0.5 mL serum sample (after perchloric acid deproteinization) and from a 0.1 mL urine sample, after TBDMS derivatization. The LOD was determined to be 7.0 and 110 ng/mL for serum and urine, respectively.",

In this study, a single method for simultaneous quantification of the four HD metabolites in urine samples was developed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The four urinary metabolites were simultaneously extracted from urinary samples using a solid phase extraction (SPE) method with high extraction recoveries for all four metabolites varied in the range of 71.1-103% followed by UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. The SPE is simple and high effective only requiring 0.1 mL of urinary samples and 0.5 hr time consuming. The problem of previous co-elution of TDG and SBSNAE in UHPLC was well solved, and complete separation of TDG, SBSNAE, SBMSE and MSMTESE from SPE-processed urine matrix was obtained to increase specificity and sensitivity. A full method validation was performed for each analyte in urine matrix. The linear range of calibration curves for the four analytes were respectively from 0.50-500 ng/mL for TDG and SBSNAE, 0.05-500 ng/mL for SBMSE and MSMTESE with coefficient of determination value (R2) >/= 0.990. The limit of detection was 0.25 ng/mL for TDG and SBSNAE, 0.01 ng/mL for SBMSE and MSMTESE spiked in normal urine. The intra/inter-day precision for each analyte at three QC levels had relative standard deviation (%RSD) of </= 10.3%, and the intra/inter-day accuracy ranged between 88.0-108%. This developed method allows for simultaneous and trace measurement of four HD urinary metabolites within one single determination with the lowest usage amount of urine samples over all previous methods This study provides a useful tool for early diagnosis and monitoring of HD poisoning for medical treatment with high confidence, avoiding the need for application of several analysis methods.",

TDGO in the samples was reduced with TiCl3, and then determined together with TDG as a single analyte. The sample preparation procedures, including two solid-phase-extraction (SPE) clean-up steps, were optimized to improve the sensitivity of the method. The limits of detection (LOD) for both TDG and TDG plus TDGO (TDG + TDGO) were 0.1 ng/mL, and the limits of quantitation (LOQ) for both were 0.3 ng/mL. The method was used in a rabbit cutaneous SM exposure model. Domestic rabbits were exposed to neat liquid SM at three dosage levels (0.02, 0.05, and 0.15 LD50), and the urinary excretion of four species of hydrolysis metabolites, namely free TDG, free plus conjugated TDG (total TDG), free TDG + TDGO, and free plus conjugated TDG + TDGO (total TDG + TDGO), was evaluated to investigate the metabolic processes. The total urinary excretion profiles of the metabolites, including the peak time, time window, and dose-response and time-response relationships, were clarified. The results revealed that the concentrations of TDG and TDG + TDGO in the urine increased quickly and then decreased rapidly in the first two days after SM exposure. The cumulative amount of total TDG + TDGO excreted in urine during the first five days accounted for 0.5-1% of the applied dose of SM. It is also concluded that TDG and TDGO in urine existed mainly in free form, the levels of glucuronide and of sulfate conjugates of TDG or TDGO were very low, and most hydrolysis metabolites were present in the oxidized form (TDGO). The study indicates that the abnormal increase of TDG and TDGO excretion levels can be used as a diagnostic indicator and establishes a reference time-window for retrospective analysis and sampling after SM exposure.",

SM is also considered as a major threat to civilians because of its existing stockpiles and easy production. Analysis of exposure biomarkers in biological samples collected from suspected victims is a useful tool for early diagnosis of SM poisoning. In this study, a sensitive and rapid quantitative method with ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed for simultaneous determination of seven SM plasma biomarkers, including its oxidative, hydrolysis and beta-lyase metabolites. A simple one-step protein precipitation with acetonitrile-methanol (4:1) was used for sample preparation. A full validation was conducted with respect to specificity, linearity, recovery, matrix effect, precision, accuracy and stability. The lower limits of quantification for the seven metabolites ranged from 0.01 ug/L to 5 ug/L. The intraday relative standard deviation was less than 7.0%, and the interday deviation was less than 9.1%. The recoveries varied in the range from 82.8% to 118%. This method has been successfully applied to a toxicokinetic study for obtaining the plasma profiles of seven metabolites in SM-exposed rats, following a single subcutaneous dose of 3.3 mg/kg. All the targeted compounds were detected in rat plasma. bis-beta-Chloroethyl sulfoxide (SMO), thiodiglycol (TDG), thiodiglycol sulfoxide (TDGO), 1,1'-sulfonylbis-[2-S-(N-acetylcysteinyl)ethane (SBSNAE), 1,1'-sulfonylbis-[2-(methylsulfinyl)ethane] (SBMSE) and 1-methylsulfinyl-2-[2-(methylthio)ethylsulfonyl]ethane (MSMTESE) were found to be the major metabolites in rat plasma. The time windows for the detection of these metabolites were varied in the range of 5 min to 48 hr after exposure. The method provides a useful tool for short-term diagnosis of SM poisoning.",

Step 1: Container Draining: Workers drain the mustard agent from the steel containers by manually removing the containers' plugs through a glove box system that has been used safely by the Army for agent handling for more than 10 years. A tube is inserted and the agent is pumped to an agent holding tank. Step 2: Agent Destruction and Confirmation: The mustard agent is fed into a tank containing hot water where it is vigorously mixed, causing the mustard agent to react with the water to form a biodegradableliquid byproduct called hydrolysate. ... Thiodiglycol, an organic chemical used in the paint and ink industry, is readily biodegradable. A large batch made up of four well-mixed, small batches is tested to confirm complete agent destruction. Step 3: Hydrolysate Disposal: Although free of mustard agent, the hydrolysate still is considered an industrial hazardous waste and requires further treatment. This post-treatment step - where the hydrolysate is added to a mixture of ordinary sewage treatment bacteria that \"digests\" the thiodiglycol to form carbon dioxide and wet solids - /will be conducted offsite/.",

It is also a Schedule 2B precursor (dual-use chemicals with low to moderate commercial use and high-risk precursors) to mustard gas, sesquimustard, HT, T, and Q. It is used to manufacture ball-point pen ink. HUMAN STUDIES: The hydrolysis products of mustard gas are reported to exhibit toxicity. However, thiodiglycol, the major breakdown product, exhibits low toxicity. Therefore, it is likely that the majority of the toxic effects attributed to the hydrolysis products are due to unreacted mustard and bis(chloroethyl)polysulfides present in the original material. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acute dermal irritation was tested on rabbits. A very slight erythema was noted in 1 out of 3 animals 1 hour after treatment until day 4. The effect was completely reversible within 5 days. No cutaneous reactions were observed in the other 2 animals. In a guinea pig maximization test the challenge resulted in no skin reaction in thiodiglycol treated animals. In the Rat Inhalation Hazard Test, no mortality was reported after 8 hr exposure to a saturated atmosphere at room temperature. Immediately after the start of exposure, the animals showed attempts to escape. Irritation of the mucous membranes was observed 1 hr after start of exposure. In a prenatal developmental toxicity study in rats a significant increase in dumbbell ossifications of thoracic vertebral bodies was noted (12% versus 5.2% in control). Other significant increases in skeletal variations, such as rudimentary cervical ribs were also observed (7.1% versus 1.2% in control) as well as a general increase in total variations (concerning affected fetuses/litter: 52.9% versus 38.6% in control). Thiodiglycol did not induce reverse gene mutations in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and E. coli WP2uvrA at concentrations up to 5 mg/plate in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Thiodiglycol was not mutagenic in mouse lymphoma, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assays, but it induced chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells. The mechanism of vesication from sulfur mustard remains unknown in spite of 80 years of investigation. It was reported that sulfur mustard-related inhibition of one or more protein (serine/threonine) phosphatases in tissue cytosol in vitro, could be a mechanism common to other vesicants such as cantharidin and Lewisite. This inhibition was related to the concentration of thiodiglycol, the hydrolysis product of sulfur mustard, rather than to the concentration of mustard itself. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: It was not toxic to bluegill sunfish at 1,000 mg/L.",

Thiodiglycol is used as a precursor for sulfur mustard and is a hydrolysis product of the chemical weapon sulfur mustard. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.09X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates thiodiglycol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase thiodiglycol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 hours. Thiodiglycol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, thiodiglycol is expected to have very high mobility based upon Koc values of 0.12-13.70. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Thiodiglycol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation of thiodiglycol in soil has been reported suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental process in soil and water. If released into water, thiodiglycol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the reported Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis of thiodiglycol did not occur at pH 4, 7 or 11. Occupational exposure to thiodiglycol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where thiodiglycol is produced or used. Because thiodiglycol is a hydrolysis product of the chemical weapon sulfur mustard, decontamination workers or individuals in an area that experienced a sulfur mustard attack may be exposed to residual thiodiglycol.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(2) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.9X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(3). Thiodiglycol did not undergo hydrolysis at pH 4, 7 or 11(1). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of -0.63(5) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Thiodiglycol did not undergo photolysis in aqueous solution after irradiation by sunlight for 14 days(1). Based on studies done in aerobic sludge with 19% biodegradation in 4 weeks(6), anaerobic sludge with 42% biodegradation in 185 days(7) and in soil where biodegradation was noted in 5 soils(1), biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

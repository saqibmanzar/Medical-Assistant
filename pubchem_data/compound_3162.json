This agent acts as an inverse agonist that combines with, and stabilizes the inactive form of the H1-receptor, shifting the H1 receptor equilibrium toward the inactive state. This results in downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and NF-kappaB dependent antigen presentation, chemotaxis, as well as expression of cell-adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In addition, children may be more prone than adults to paradoxically experience CNS stimulation rather than sedation when antihistamines are used as nighttime sleep aids. Because doxylamine may cause marked drowsiness that may be potentiated by other CNS depressants (e.g., sedatives, tranquilizers), the antihistamine should be used in children receiving one of these drugs only under the direction of a physician. As an antihistamine, doxylamine should be used in children 2 to younger than 6 years of age only under the direction of a physician; use of the drug in children younger than 2 years of age is not recommended.",

Although the total recovery of radioactivity was the same for the low- and high-dose studies (90.2%), the rate of plasma elimination of doxylamine and its demethylated metabolite (desmethyldoxylamine) was slower for the high dose group. The 24 hr urinary excretion of doxylamine metabolites, desmethyl- and didesmethyldoxylamine, was significantly incr and the polar doxylamine metabolites were significantly decr as the iv doxylamine succinate dose was incr. The plasma elimination of GC-detected doxylamine was determined after po admin of Bendectin (doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride) /also contains dicyclomine hydrochloride/ at 7, 13.3, and 27 mg/kg to adult female rhesus monkeys. As the dose incr, the clearance of doxylamine decr. A statistically evaluated fit of the po data to a single-compartment, parallel first-order elimination model and a single-compartment, parallel first- and second-order (Michaelis-Menten) elimination model indicated that the more complex model containing the second-order process was most consistent with the observed elimination data. /Doxylamine succinate/",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

Data are presented concerning the stability of the drug in animal feed, extraction efficiencies, and the use of the silica gel cleanup column to separate the caffeine interference from doxylamine in extracts of human urine. Partition values and ancillary data concerning analysis of the drug in feed, by HPLC at levels as low as 10 ppm are also reported.",

Pharmacokinetics of doxylamine were determined from multiple plasma doxylamine concn measured during the 24 hr postdose. Mean kinetic variables were peak plasma level (99 ng/ml), time of peak (2.4 hr postdose), elimination half-life (10.1 hr) and apparent oral clearance (217 ml/min). It was suggested that analogous analytic methodology can be used to study the pharmacokinetics of other drugs of the same class as doxylamine.",

FDA recognizes, however, that despite the large number of pregnancies evaluated to date the possibility that doxylamine may be weakly teratogenic cannot be excluded. Doxylamine was commercially available in the US for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy in combination with dicyclomine and pyridoxine until 1976, and then in combination with only pyridoxine until 1983 when the manufacturer voluntarily discontinued manufacturing and distributing the combination. Most epidemiologic studies (case-control and cohort) in which fixed combinations of doxylamine and pyridoxine with or without dicyclomine were used during pregnancy indicate that an association between use of these combinations and adverse fetal effects does not appear to exist, but the possibility that the drug is weakly teratogenic cannot be excluded. In a few studies, a weak association between use of the fixed combinations during pregnancy and specific fetal abnormalities (e.g., pyloric stenosis, cardiac defects, oral clefts) was reported, but a causal relationship with the drugs was not established and these findings have not been confirmed by many other studies. Women considering self-medication with doxylamine during pregnancy should consult a health professional for advice regarding the relative risks and benefits of such therapy.",

Studies in rats and mice using doxylamine succinate dosages up to 125 times the maximum human dosage did not reveal evidence of observable congenital abnormalities, but wavy ribs and diaphragmatic hernias occurred in rats at dosages 125-375 times the maximum human dosage; an overall increase in fetal wastage, varying from zero to threefold, occurred in most rodents receiving dosages 125 or more times greater than the maximum human dosage. In a small study in monkeys receiving a fixed combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride throughout fetal organogenesis at dosages 10-20 times the maximum human dosage, intraventricular septal defects were present in 4 of 7 fetuses delivered on day 100 of gestation (full-term gestation is about 160 days), while 2 fetuses aborted on the 46th and 56th day of gestation appeared to be developing normally and 3 other fetuses allowed to develop to term were normal. The importance of septal defects in these monkeys is not known, since an opening in the septum is usually present early during fetal development in monkeys. In other studies in monkeys receiving the fixed combination for shorter periods of time, there was no evidence of fetal toxicity.",

Potency of each agent was ranked 1-5 in each of the following in vitro assays: 1) inhibition of (3H)histamine binding to microsomal HIC, 2) inhibition of histamine binding to microsomal P450, 3) inhibition of the P450-catalyzed demethylation of aminopyrine, 4) inhibition of lymphocyte mitogenesis, and 5) stimulation of tumor colony formation. An overall rank score was assigned to each drug and correlated with tumor growth stimulation in vivo. Two laboratories conducted in vivo studies in a blinded fashion. Female C57Bl and C3H mice were given a sc injection on day 1 of syngeneic B16F10 melanoma cells (5), respectively. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups, then received a single, daily ip injection of an estimated human-equivalent dose (or range of doses) of antihistamine or vehicle control for 18-21 days before being killed. Tumors were surgically removed and wet weights compared statistically among groups. ... The cumulative potency of each drug in affecting tumor growth or growth mechanisms in the five in vitro assays ranked as follows: Loratidine and astemizole ranked highest and were equally potent, followed in decreasing order by hydroxyzine, doxylamine, and cetirizine. A significant correlation (r = 0.97; p < 0.02) was observed between the rank order of potency of the antihistamines in all five in vitro assays and the rank order to enhance tumor growth in vivo:Loratidine and astemizole significantly (p < 0.001) promoted the growth of both melanoma and fibrosarcoma, hydroxyzine significantly (p < 0.001) promoted the growth of melanoma, while doxylamine and cetirizine did not promote the growth of either tumor.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Corrosive chemicals will destroy the membranes of the mouth, throat, and esophagus and, in addition, have a high risk of being aspirated into the victim's lungs during vomiting which increases the medical problems. If the victim is conscious and not convulsing, give 1 or 2 glasses of water to dilute the chemical and IMMEDIATELY call a hospital or poison control center. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Transport the victim IMMEDIATELY to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as a solvent; inhibitor in hydraulic fluids; chemical intermediate. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: A corrosive irritant to skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. 8 female and 8 male volunteers were exposed to tributylamine in varying concentrations. An odor threshold of 0.07 +/- 0.03 ppm (approx. 0.54 mg/cu m) was identified in this study. ANIMAL STUDIES: 6 albino rabbits, tested on 2 sites (1 site abraded, 1 site intact skin), 4 hr exposure, observation after 4, 24, 72 hr, Draize method used for scoring, erythema/eschar formation and for edema formation.  Some thickening of the skin after 24 hr, exfoliation of epidermis after 5 d, skin appeared normal after 10 d. Six albino rabbits were subjected to test irritation of the eye. They were exposed to tributylamine into their conjunctival sac. After the exposure all animals showed slight conjuctival congestion, which was reversible within 2 to 3 hours. Exposure of four male and four female rats to 120 ppm for nineteen 6 hr exposures caused nose irritation, restlessness, incoordination, and tremors, organs appeared normal at autopsy. When rats were treated orally with 0.45 or 4.5 mg/kg bw/day daily for 6 months, there were no effects with respect to general constitution, behavior or histology. Pregnant rats were orally treated by gavage on gestation days 6 -15 with doses of 15, 45 and 135 mg/kg/day. Three dams died prematurely on days 7 and 8. The other animals of this group showed transient reductions in food consumption and body weight gain. There were no embryo- or fetotoxic effects except a slight and dose-related increase in fetal body weight gain, which was significant at the highest dose. The treatment did not produce malformations. Tributylamine did not induce micronuclei in vivo in mice.",

GM-05757 cells were incubated with 2,4-D (used as its dimethylammonium salt) in binary combinations with /12 chemicals including/ ... tributylamine (102829), ... for 1 hr. All cmpds were used at concns previously determined not to have induced any growth inhibition (NOECs), measured as the ratio of cells counted immediately after exposure ended to those counted 48 hr after exposure ended. The concns of 2,4-D & the other chemicals alone & in combination causing a 20% decr in cell growth (EC20) were determined. Associations between the EC20s of the combinations & their lipophilicity, as indicated by the logarithm of the octanol/water partition coefficient, were examined by logistic regression techniques. All cmpds enhanced the toxicity of 2,4-D, as evidenced by decreases in the EC20. Except in the case of nitriloacetic-acid, the decreases in the EC20 were similar, varying from 43.3 to 60.7% over that of 2,4-D alone. ... Except for tributylamine, the decreases in EC20 produced by the combined exposures were strongly correlated with their lipophilicity. The correlation coefficient was reduced if tributylamine was included in the analysis. ... All chemicals may exhibit synergistic toxic effects when combined at nontoxic doses with dissimilar cmpds. The strength of the correlation appears to be related to lipophilicity. This correlation may reflect the ability of lipophilic cmpds to damage the cell membrane which then facilitates & enhances uptake of hydrophilic agents.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0934 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tributylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tributylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. Tributylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tributylamine is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1860. The pKa of tributylamine is 10.89, indicating that this compound will exist entirely in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a cation and cations do not volatilize. Tributylamine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 2% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, tributylamine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's pKa. BCFs of <0.32-47 in carp suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to tributylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tributylamine is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population is not likely to be exposed to tributylamine. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It has a role as an antiviral drug, a sodium-dependent Pi-transporter inhibitor, a HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor and a geroprotector. It is a one-carbon compound, a member of phosphonic acids and a carboxylic acid. It is functionally related to a phosphonic acid and a formic acid.

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Thus, HSV strains resistant to acyclovir or CMV strains resistant to ganciclovir may be sensitive to foscarnet. However, acyclovir or ganciclovir resistant mutants with alterations in the viral DNA polymerase may be resistant to foscarnet and may not respond to therapy with foscarnet.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

After oral foscarnet, plasma concentrations were less than 33 mumol/L in four patients; two had occasional concentrations of 35 to 50 mumol/L. The extent of absorption varied between 12% and 22%. During intravenous infusion, plasma concentrations ranged between 75 and 265 mumol/L. The disposition of foscarnet was triphasic, with mean half-lives of 0.45, 3.3, and 18 hours. Excretion data suggested elimination was by tubular secretion and glomerular filtration. Renal clearance was 176 mL/min 1.73 sq m. The apparent nonrenal clearance, 40 mL/min 1.73 sq m, probably reflects sequestration of foscarnet into bone. Ten percent to 28% of the cumulative dose may have been deposited in bone 2 days after infusion. A slight increase in serum calcium levels and changes in serum phosphate values may reflect the uptake of foscarnet in bone. Five patients had diarrhea (oral) and two had thrombophlebitis (intravenous).",

Foscarnet sodium exerts its antiviral activity by a selective inhibition at the pyrophosphate binding site on virus-specific DNA polymerases at concentrations that do not affect cellular DNA polymerases. Foscarnet sodium does not require activation (phosphorylation) by thymidine kinase or other kinases and therefore is active in vitro against HSV TK deficient mutants and CMV UL97 mutants. Thus, HSV strains resistant to acyclovir or CMV strains resistant to ganciclovir may be sensitive to foscarnet sodium. However, acyclovir or ganciclovir resistant mutants with alterations in the viral DNA polymerase may be resistant to foscarnet sodium and may not respond to therapy with foscarnet sodium. The combination of foscarnet sodium and ganciclovir has been shown to have enhanced activity in vitro.",

Nucleotide cyclases and DNA-polymerases catalyze analogous reactions, i.e. a phosphodiester bond formation, and have similar topologies in their active sites. Inhibition by foscarnet of adenylyl cyclase isoforms was therefore tested with (i) purified catalytic domains C1 and C2 of types I and VII (IC1 and VIIC1) and of type II (IIC2) and (ii) membrane-bound holoenzymes (from mammalian tissues and types I, II, and V heterologously expressed in Sf9 cell membranes). Foscarnet was more potent than PP(i) in suppressing forskolin-stimulated catalysis by both, IC1/IIC2 and VIIC1/IIC2. Stimulation of VIIC1/IIC2 by Galpha(s) relieved the inhibition by foscarnet but not that by PP(i). The IC(50) of foscarnet on membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases also depended on their mode of regulation. These findings predict that receptor-dependent cAMP formation is sensitive to inhibition by foscarnet in some, but not all, cells. This was verified with two cell lines; foscarnet blocked cAMP accumulation after A(2A)-adenosine receptor stimulation in PC12 but not in HEK-A(2A) cells. Foscarnet also inhibited soluble and, to a lesser extent, particulate guanylyl cylase. Thus, foscarnet interferes with the generation of cyclic nucleotides, an effect which may give rise to clinical side effects. The extent of inhibition varies with the enzyme isoform and with the regulatory input.",

Case report information was obtained from Medical Service Daily Rounds during the patients' hospitalization and from the patients' medical records. Computerized (MEDLINE) and manual (Index Medicus) search methods were used to obtain English-language literature published between 1980 and 1993.Foscarnet is a synthetic antiviral agent with activity against herpesviruses and HIV. The incidence of seizures with foscarnet infusion is high, ranging from 13 to 15 percent. Predisposing factors such as renal impairment, electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities, and underlying neurologic disorders have been associated with seizures during foscarnet therapy. We describe two patients with AIDS who developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures while receiving foscarnet and ciprofloxacin for the treatment of CMV retinitis and disseminated MAC infection, respectively. Neither of the patients had any of the aforementioned risk factors for foscarnet-associated seizures. Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin, a known epileptogenic agent, and foscarnet may predispose patients to the development of seizures.",

All 10 patients experienced adverse events and all except one made a complete recovery. One patient died after receiving a total daily dose of 12.5 g for three days instead of the intended 10.9 g. The patient suffered a grand mal seizure and became comatose. Three days later the patient expired with the cause of death listed as respiratory/cardiac arrest. The other nine patients received doses ranging from 1.14 times to 8 times their recommended doses with an average of 4 times their recommended doses. Overall, three patients had seizures, three patients had renal function impairment, four patients had paresthesias either in limbs or periorally, and five patients had documented electrolyte disturbances primarily involving calcium and phosphate.",

When used intravenously (i.v.), main adverse effects of FC are a fall in hemoglobin, and an increase in liver enzymes and serum calcium. Although increased serum creatinine has been noted in several patients, deterioration of renal function is often accounted for by the concomitant use of other nephrotoxic drugs, the severity of underlying disease or the presence of graft rejection. Consequently FC is often considered as a non or poorly nephrotoxic drug. We report 4 cases of acute renal failure (ARF) which can be exclusively attributed to FC. FC was used for CMV chorioretinitis in 3 AIDS patients and in one non-immunocompromised patient. ARF was diagnosed between the 6th and 15th day of treatment, with oligoanuria in two patients (one of whom required two hemodialysis periods). ARF was most likely secondary to acute toxic tubulopathy. Three patients did not receive any other nephrotoxic drug. The fourth patient received concomitantly sulfadiazine but renal function returned to baseline value after FC completion although sulfadiazine was continued. In conclusion, our 4 observations suggest that FC may be responsible for acute tubulopathy.",

Subsequently, phosphonoformic acid (200 and 400 ug/mL) added to both in vitro fertilization and culture medium resulted in a decrease in the proportion of developed blastocysts, and the number of cells per blastocyst was lower in the treated embryos. Therefore, while phosphonoformic acid can effectively inhibit replication of BHV-1 in co-culture cells, it also inhibits development of in vitro-produced bovine embryos.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.6X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates foscarnet will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase foscarnet will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 days. Particulate-phase foscarnet will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Foscarnet does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, foscarnet is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 330. The estimated pKa of 3.13 indicates that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment. Anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as a anion and anions do not volatilize. Foscarnet is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, foscarnet is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The estimated pKa indicates foscarnet will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to foscarnet may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where foscarnet is produced or used. Exposure to foscarnet among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase foscarnet is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.0X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase foscarnet may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

These are discharged after therapeutic use through human excretion. Effluent containing high concentration of antiviral drugs discharged from production facilities is also a cause of concern to nearby aquatic bodies. There is an increased interest in their removal because they are highly bioactive. Some antiviral drugs are resistant to conventional methods of degradation, and there is a risk of development of antiviral resistance in humans and animals if exposed repeatedly for long periods. To date, the potential human, animal, and ecological risks associated with the discharge of these antiviral compounds to the environment are not well documented. This study presents a brief summary on occurrence, ecotoxicological risks, and physicochemical properties of antiviral drugs in the environment. The needs regarding removal, disposal, and treatment of antiviral drugs are also addressed(1). /Antiviral drugs/"

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

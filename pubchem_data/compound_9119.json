Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

This study was made possible with highly sensitive accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), capable of detecting [(14)C]-DBC equivalents in plasma and urine following a dose considered of de minimus risk to human health. Plasma and urine were collected over 72 hr. The plasma Cmax was 68.8 +/- 44.3 fg/mL with a Tmax of 2.25 +/- 1.04 hr. Elimination occurred in two distinct phases: a rapid (a)-phase, with a /half life/ of 5.8 +/- 3.4 hr and an apparent elimination rate constant (Kel) of 0.17 +/- 0.12 fg/hr, followed by a slower (beta)-phase, with a /half life/ of 41.3 +/- 29.8 hr and an apparent Kel of 0.03 +/- 0.02 fg/hr. In spite of the high degree of hydrophobicity (log Kow of 7.4), DBC was eliminated rapidly in humans, as are most PAHs in animals, compared to other hydrophobic persistent organic pollutants such as, DDT, PCBs and TCDD. Preliminary examination utilizing a new UHPLC-AMS interface, suggests the presence of polar metabolites in plasma as early as 45 min following dosing. This is the first in vivo data set describing pharmacokinetics in humans of a high molecular weight PAH and should be a valuable addition to risk assessment paradigms.",

Like other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, dibenzol(a,l)pyrene requires metabolic activation to exert its mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity. In the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7, dibenzol(a,l)pyrene is stereoselectively metabolized to the (-)-anti- and (+)-3-syn-dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-11,12-diol 13,14-epoxides (DB(a,l)PDE) which both bind extensively to deoxyadenosine residues in DNA. To further characterize the underlying mechanism of its strong carcinogenicity, the relationship between DNA binding and mutagenicity of dibenzol(a,l)pyrene was determined. Racemic dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol and the two individual (+)- and (-)-enantiomers, the metabolic precursors of the stereoisomeric fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides, were also investigated. Induction of mutations at the HPRT locus was measured in a MCF-7 cell-mediated Chinese hamster V79 cell mutation assay. The parent hydrocarbon, (+ or -)-dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol, and (-)-dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol were highly mutagenic under the assay conditions. In contrast, (+)-dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-(llS,12S)-dihydrodiol was not mutagenic using MCF-7 cells as the metabolic activating system. Analysis of DNA adducts in the same experiments revealed that MCF-7 cells treated with (-)-dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol formed exclusively (-)-anti-DB(a,l)PDE adducts whereas cells treated with (+)-dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol did not contain detectable levels of DNA adducts. These results suggest that specific cytochrome p450 enzymes may have high stereoselectivity for activation of the two dibenzol(a,l)pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol enantiomers, and this may play an important role in the metabolic activation of the strong carcinogen dibenzol(a,l)pyrene in human cells.",

Since the fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides were hydrolytically unstable under the experimental conditions, their enzymatic formation was determined by analyzing the tetraols as their products of acidic hydrolysis upon addition of perchloric acid. The various stereoisomeric tetraols formed were separated by HPLC and identified by co-chromatography with authentic tetraols, which had been prepared by acidic hydrolysis of synthetically available syn- and anti-dihydrodiol epoxides and characterized by NMR and UV spectroscopy. Under standardized conditions the acidic hydrolysis of syn-dihydrodiol epoxides of benzo[c]chrysene, benzo[g]chrysene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene resulted in the formation of two tetraols with cis/trans ratios of 81:19, 77:23 and 80:20, respectively, whereas the anti-dihydrodiol epoxides underwent almost exclusively trans hydrolysis. The proportion of the stereoisomeric tetraols obtained from microsomal incubations indicates that all three dihydrodiols are predominantly oxidized at the adjacent olefinic double bond to the anti-diastereomers of the corresponding fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides accounting for 4-35% of the ethyl acetate-extractable metabolites. To allow quantitative assessment of the metabolites (3)H-labeled trans-dihydrodiols were synthesized by reduction of the corresponding o-quinones with sodium borotritide. Metabolic conversion of benzo[c]chrysene-trans-9,10- and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-trans-11,12-dihydrodiol by rat liver microsomes were in a similar low range during the first 10 min of incubation (6.2 +/- 1.2 and 3.4 +/- 1.0 nmol substrate/nmol cytochrome P450/10 min, respectively), whereas the conversion of benzo[g]chrysene-trans-11,12-dihydrodiol was much higher (20.6 +/- 2.2 nmol substrate/nmol cytochrome P450/10 min). Given the strong intrinsic mutagenic and carcinogenic activity of the fjord region dihydrodiol epoxides, our data indicate that their formation, even at a relatively low level, may contribute significantly to the biological activity of the parent hydrocarbons.",

The mechanism of metabolic activation of dibenzo(a,l)pyrene in the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7 was elucidated by analyzing the dibenzo(a,l)pyrene-DNA adducts formed by (35)S-phosphorothioate post labeling, immobilized boronate chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Six dibenzo(a,l)pyrene-DNA adducts were detected. Comparison with those formed in cells by dibenzo(a,l)pyrene-11,12-diol and by reaction of DNA with syn- and anti-(benzylic hydroxyl and epoxide oxygen cis and trans, respectively) dibenzo(a,l)pyrene-11,12-diol-13,14-epoxide (DB(a,l)PDE) demonstrated that all dibenzo(a,l)pyrene-DNA adducts in MCF-7 cells were formed by these diolepoxide isomers. Cellular DNA contained large amounts of two syn- and one anti-DB(a,l)PDE-DNA adducts and small amounts of one syn- and two anti-dibenzo(a,l)pyrene-11,12-diol-13,14-epoxide-DNA adducts. The ability of human cells to activate dibenzo(a,l)pyrene to its fjord-region 11,12-diol 13,14-epoxides suggests that environmental exposure to dibenzo(a,l)pyrene could pose a risk for humans.",

Of all human p450s, lAl was the most active in the metabolism of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (310 pmol/min, nmol p450) and had 5-23-fold higher catalytic activity than other p450s examined. The order of activity in the formation of the 11,12-dihydrodiol was as follows: lAl (116 pmol/min, nmol p450) > 2C9 (29) > lA2 (22) > 2B6 (18) > 3A4 (16) > others (< or = 5). The Km of lAl for dibenzo[a,l]pyrene and Vmax for the formation of 11,12-dihydrodiol were 3.9 uM and 0.13/min, respectively. Liver microsomes from 14 individuals were shown to metabolize dibenzo[a,l]pyrene and the rates for production of 11,12-dihydrodiol ranged from 4 to 71 pmol/min, nmol p450. Lung microsomes from six organ donors formed the 11,12-dihydrodiol at a rate from 0.1 to 1.3 pmol/min, mg of microsomal protein. These findings describe the potential of individual p450s present in liver and lung to contribute to the metabolic activation and the carcinogenicity of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material.

It is not produced commercially and used mostly as an experimental carcinogen. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: DB[a,l]P metabolites bind to DNA in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. The PAH-DNA adduct level formed may determine whether p53 and p21VAF1 pathways respond, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, or fail to respond and increase the risk of mutation induction by these DNA lesions. Sister-chromatid exchanges frequencies were significantly increased in human lung fibroblast exposed to dibenzo[a,l]pyrene in relation to controls. ANIMAL STUDIES: DB[a,l]P), the most carcinogenic PAH tested in rodent bioassays, exerts its pathobiological activity via metabolic formation of electrophilically reactive DNA-binding fjord region. DB[a,l]P induces, via its bay-region diol epoxide, a contact hypersensitivity reaction that may promote tumor development and thereby enhance carcinogenic potency. DB[a,l]P was more mutagenic than benzo(a)pyrene in Salmonella TA98 and TA100. The mutation spectra of DB[a,l]P and benzo(a)pyrene were significantly different in TA98 and TA104. The high genotoxic activity of DB[a,l]P is related to the formation of nucleotide excision repair-resistant and persistent DB[a,l]P-derived adenine adducts in cellular DNA.",

These models used synthetic carcinogens, lacked a specific mechanism of activity or used non-physiologic doses for carcinogen or inhibitor.

Oral cytology supplied keratinocytes after 1, 10, or 25 weeks of treatment. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry/laser scanning cytometry. Initiation (1-6 weeks) was suppressed by reducing DNA damage (oxidation lesions: 8-oxo-dG), and repair (comet, fpg, OGG1, NTH1). Reduction in promotion (6-10 weeks) was identified by depressed proliferation (cell cycle, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation (BrdU)) and aneuploidy (propidium iodide stain). p53 and apoptosis expressions were increased (Sub G(1), mitochondrion activation: Apo 2.7, and nucleosomal formation: mebstain (TUNEL)). VE(as) administration reduced dysplasia (10 weeks) and oral cancer formation at 25 (0/7 vs. 5/7 DB[a,l]P) and 30 weeks (3/7 vs. 6/7 DB[a,l]P). Inhibition of oral carcinogenesis by VE(as) involved reversal of several cellular events that contribute towards oral cancer.",

DBC (4 nmol) was most potent, reaching 100% tumor incidence with a shorter latency to tumor formation, less than 20 weeks of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) promotion compared to all other treatments. Multiplicity was 4 times greater than BaP (400 nmol). Both PAHs produced primarily papillomas followed by squamous cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ. Diesel particulate extract (1 mg SRM 1650b; mix 1) did not differ from toluene controls and failed to elicit a carcinogenic response. Addition of coal tar extract (1 mg SRM 1597a; mix 2) produced a response similar to BaP. Further addition of 2 mg of cigarette smoke condensate (mix 3) did not alter the response with mix 2. PAH-DNA adducts measured in epidermis 12 hr post initiation and analyzed by (32)P post-labeling, did not correlate with tumor incidence. PAH-dependent alteration in transcriptome of skin 12 hr post initiation was assessed by microarray. Principal component analysis (sum of all treatments) of the 922 significantly altered genes (p<0.05), showed DBC and BaP to cluster distinct from PAH mixtures and each other. BaP and mixtures up-regulated phase 1 and phase 2 metabolizing enzymes while DBC did not. The carcinogenicity with DBC and two of the mixtures was much greater than would be predicted based on published Relative Potency Factors (RPFs).",

In order to better assess the health risks associated with this class of compounds, a total of 67 polycyclic aromatic compounds that either have been identified (55) or are suspected to be present (12) in urban aerosol samples were tested for mutagenicity in a forward mutation assay based on human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The cell line used (designated hlAlv2) constitutively expresses the cytochrome p4501Al, which is known to be necessary for the metabolism of many promutagens. The polycyclic aromatic compounds tested included 39 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). 19 oxygen-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and nine N02-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). A total of 26 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were mutagenic. In comparing the minimum mutagenic concentrations of the mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with that of benzo[a]pyrene it was found that dibenzo(a,l)pyrene, cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene, naphtho[2,1-a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, and l-methylbenzo[a]pyrene were 24 + or - 21, 6.9 + or - 4.2, 3.2 + 3.0, 2.9 + or - 2.9 and 1.6 + or - 1.4 times, respectively, more mutagenic than benzo[a]pyrene, and that dibenzo[a,k]fluoranthene and benzo[a]pyrene were approximately equally mutagenic. The 19 other mutagenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were between approximately 2 and approximately 1800 times less mutagenic than benzo[a]pyrene. Of the oxy-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tested only phenalenone, 7H-benz[d,e]anthracen-7-one, 3-nitro-6H-dibenzo[b,d]pyran-6-one, cyclopenta[c,d]pyren-3(4H)-one, 6H-benzo[c,d]pyren-6-one (BPK) and anthanthrenequinone were mutagenic; however, with the exception of 6H-benzo[c,d]pyren-6-one, these were over 50 times less active than benzo[a]pyrene, 6H-benzo[c,d]pyren-6-one was approximately 3 times less active than benzo[a]pyrene. Seven of the nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were mutagenic including 9-nitroanthracene, l-nitropyrene, 2-nitrofluoranthene, 3-nitrofluoranthene, 1,3-dinitropyrene, 1,6-dinitropyrene (1,6-DNP) and 1,8-dinitropyrene. 1,6-dinitropyrene was approximately 4 times less active than benzo[a]pyrene; the six other mutagenic nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were between 20 and 380 times less active than benzo[a]pyrene. These results are discussed in terms of their relevance for determining the most important mutagens in ambient air. Based on reported concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds in ambient aerosols, it is possible that cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene and 6H-benzo[c,d]pyren-6-one could account for a greater proportion of the mutagenicity than benzo[a]pyrene in some aerosols.",

This study was undertaken to investigate the ability of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DBP) to induce DNA damage in a human lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5), using sister-chromatid exchanges test (SCEs), the comet assay, and evaluating point mutations in codon 12 of the K-ras protooncogene by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR-SSCPs) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP)-enriched PCR methods. Sister-chromatid exchanges frequencies were significantly increased in cells exposed to benzo[a]pyrene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene in relation to controls (p < .001). Using the standard alkaline comet assay, significant differences between groups were found for the variable comet moment (CM) when cells were exposed to BP (p < 0.001) and DBP (p < .001). Nevertheless, PCR-SSCP and RFLP-enriched PCR methods did not show any association between treatments with BP and DBP and K-ras point mutations. The data presented in this study indicated that BP and DBP induced both DNA strand breaks and sister-chromatid exchanges but not significant point mutations at codon 12 of K-ras gene in the MRC-5 cell line.",

DB[a,l]P is metabolized to these DB[a,l]PDEs which bind to DNA in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. The molecular response of MCF-7 cells to DNA damage caused by DB[a,l]PDEs was investigated by analyzing effects on the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and one of its target gene products, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with (+)-syn- and (-)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE at a concentration range of 0.001-0.1 uM resulted in DB[a,l]PDE-DNA adduct levels between 2 and 30, and 3 and 80 pmol/mg DNA, respectively, 8 hr after exposure. (-)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE exhibited a higher binding efficiency that correlated with a significantly stronger p53 response at low concentrations of the dihydrodiol epoxides. The level of p53 increased by 6-8 hr after treatment. The p21WAF1 protein amount exceeded control levels by 12 hr and remained elevated for 96 hr. At a dose of 0.01 microM (+)-syn-DB[a,l]PDE, an increase in p21WAF1 was observed in the absence of a detectable change in p53 levels. The results indicate that the increase in p53 induced by DB[a,l]PDEs in MCF-7 cells requires an adduct level of approximately 15 pmol/mg DNA and suggest that the level of adducts rather than the specific structure of the DB[a,l]PDE-DNA adduct formed triggers the p53 response. The PAH-DNA adduct level formed may determine whether p53 and p21VAF1 pathways respond, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, or fail to respond and increase the risk of mutation induction by these DNA lesions. /(+)-syn-(11S,12R,13S,14R)- and (-)-anti-(11R,12S,13S,14R)-dihydrodiol epoxides/",

These compounds are metabolized to diol epoxides that react to form DNA adducts. Nucleotide excision repair is a critical cellular defense against these bulky DNA adducts which, if not repaired, can lead to mutations and the initiation of cancer. The structural features of the PAH-adducts play a role in differential repair of these adducts by the global genomic repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair. DNA adducts derived from the PAHs containing bay-regions are repaired more rapidly than adducts derived from PAHs containing fjord-regions. We have employed the host cell reactivation assay to examine the rate of repair of these adducts in an actively transcribing gene. The pGL3 plasmid containing a luciferase gene was damaged with diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P-DE), dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P-DE), benzo[g]chrysene (B[g]Ch-DE), and benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph-DE). The plasmids were transfected into B-lymphocytes with normal repair capacity as well as lymphocytes derived from patients with the XP-A, XP-C and CS-B syndromes. We found that XPA cells were able to transcribe slowly past B[g]Ch-adducts but not the other PAHs. Using the amount of luciferase produced as a measure of DNA repair, we found that the relative rates of repair in the actively transcribing luciferase gene was B[a]P-DE>DB[a,l]P-DE, B[g]Ch-DE, >B[c]Ph-DE in repair proficient and XP-C cells. These results indicate that the abilities to transcribe past and to repair the PAH adducts are dependent on different structural features of the DNA adducts.",

The time course of erythema and the associated histological events in the skin of female SENCAR mice were determined after a single application of 6.25-200 nmol dibenzo[a,l]pyrene or selected metabolites. Dibenzo[a,l]pyrene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol, precursor to the bay-region diol epoxide, induced an erythema first present 5-6 days after treatment. Dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-8,9-dihydrodiol and other dibenzo[a,l]pyrene metabolites, however, did not induce erythema. These findings suggest a central role for the bay-region diol epoxide in the induction of the observed inflammation. The intensity and duration of erythema were dose-dependent, whereas the delayed appearance of erythema was constant and dose-independent. These results suggest induction of an immune hypersensitivity by dibenzo[a,l] pyrene and its 11,12-di hydrodiol. Histological changes in the skin were consistent with a contact hypersensitivity reaction and included, in association with erythema, epidermal hyperplasia and the presence of mononuclear leukocytes in the dermis. Animals were tested for dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-induced contact hypersensitivity. Female SENCAR mice were treated with a single dermal application of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene or 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene. Five days later, the animals were challenged with a single application of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene or 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene to the ear pinna. Ear swelling exhibited features of a contact hypersensitivity reaction, including (1) delayed appearance after challenge, (2) noninducibility in animals not previously exposed to chemical sensitizer, and (3) chemical specificity. The results suggest that dibenzo[a,l]pyrene induces, via its bay-region diol epoxide, a contact hypersensitivity reaction that may promote tumor development and thereby enhance carcinogenic potency.",

DBC (4 nmol) was most potent, reaching 100% tumor incidence with a shorter latency to tumor formation, less than 20 weeks of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) promotion compared to all other treatments. Multiplicity was 4 times greater than BaP (400 nmol). Both PAHs produced primarily papillomas followed by squamous cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ. Diesel particulate extract (1 mg SRM 1650b; mix 1) did not differ from toluene controls and failed to elicit a carcinogenic response. Addition of coal tar extract (1 mg SRM 1597a; mix 2) produced a response similar to BaP. Further addition of 2 mg of cigarette smoke condensate (mix 3) did not alter the response with mix 2. PAH-DNA adducts measured in epidermis 12 hr post initiation and analyzed by (32)P post-labeling, did not correlate with tumor incidence. PAH-dependent alteration in transcriptome of skin 12 hr post initiation was assessed by microarray. Principal component analysis (sum of all treatments) of the 922 significantly altered genes (p<0.05), showed DBC and BaP to cluster distinct from PAH mixtures and each other. BaP and mixtures up-regulated phase 1 and phase 2 metabolizing enzymes while DBC did not. The carcinogenicity with DBC and two of the mixtures was much greater than would be predicted based on published Relative Potency Factors (RPFs).",

Dibenzo(a,l)pyrene presence in the stack emissions of waste incinerators, in coal combustion stack emissions, in curing smoke, products of coal gasification and in tobacco smoke will result in its direct release into the environment. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 4.5X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenzo(a,l)pyrene will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase dibenzo(a,l)pyrene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dibenzo(a,l)pyrene absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 6.5X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenzo(a,l)pyrene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. In general PAHs with four or more rings do not biodegrade readily. Using activated sludge from three waste treatment plants, no greater than 6.2% of the theoretical oxygen demand was reached over a 144 hours, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 6000 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. However, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as some fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to dibenzo(a,l)pyrene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibenzo(a,l)pyrene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. The general population may be exposed to dibenzo(a,l)pyrene via inhalation of ambient air contaminated from combustion emissions, inhalation of tobacco smoke and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4).  According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 6000(SRC), from its log Kow of 7.71(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Dibenzo(a,l)pyrene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as some fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(7). Using activated sludge from three waste treatment plants, no greater than 6.2% of the theoretical oxygen demand was reached over a 144 hour time period(8), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

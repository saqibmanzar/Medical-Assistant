When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to the atmosphere, 2-chloropropane will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 515.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2-chloropropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 17 days. An estimated Koc value of 53 suggests that 2-chloropropane will have high mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces should be significant given the vapor pressure of this compound. Hydrolysis may be important in both moist soil and water; a hydrolysis half-life of 38 days was reported for 2-chloropropane in aqueous solution at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C. In water, 2-chloropropane is not expected to adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its Koc value. This compound should volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms should be low based on an estimated BCF value of 16. The general population may be exposed to 2-chloropropane via ingestion of food. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at workplaces where 2-chloropropane is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

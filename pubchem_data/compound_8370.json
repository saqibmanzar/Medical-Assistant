Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

While some resources use the hydrogen gas as the reference gas for the vapor density calculation, many resources (particularly in relation to safety considerations at commercial and industrial facilities in the U.S.) defines the vapor density with respect to the density of air, which has an arbitrary value of one.  If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Metabolites were identified and quantified by electron capture gas-liquid chromatography. Structures were confirmed by selective ion monitoring gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The formation of pentachlorophenol was dependent on the presence of NADPH and oxygen and inhibited by carbon monoxide SKF 525A, and metyrapone. Conversion of HCB to pentachlorophenol was stimulated by pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital but not by 3-methylcholanthrene, or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. In contrast, the conversion of pentachlorophenol to tetrachloro-1,4-benzenediol was markedly induced by 3-methylcholanthrene but poorly by phenobarbital. HCB, Aroclor 1254, and isosafrole stimulated both hydroxylations. The cytochrome p450 inhibitor 9-hydroxyellipticine inhibited conversion of pentachlorophenol to tetrachlorobenzenediols by HCB and beta-naphthoflavone induced micrsomes. In addition to hydroxylation reactions, evidence was obtained for the conjugaton of HBC with glutathione catalyzed by a microsomal glutathione transferase. Radioactivity from (14)carbon HCB was bound to microsomal protein during aerobic incubations. Binding was inhibited by GSH and N-acetyl-cysteine.",

Long Evans rats were administered intraperitoneal injections of 400 umol/kg phenobarbital for 4 consecutive days and were sacrificed the following day, or were administered single doses of heptachlor, chlordane, hexachlorobenzene, toxaphene, dieldrin, lindane, or p,p'-DDT and were sacrificed 4 days later. Microsomal liver fractions were analyzed for benzo(a)pyrene and testosterone metabolism. All the compounds tested except lindane induced both benzo(a)pyrene and testosterone hydroxylases. Hexachlorobenzene induced formation of benzo(a)pyrene 9,10-dihydrodiol and 7,8-dihydrodiol metabolites. A different combination of testosterone hydroxylases was induced by each of the chemicals. Phenobarbital induced the activities of the 15-beta, 16-alpha, and 16-beta testosterone hydroxylases. With the exception of lindane, all of the pesticides tested induced the 16-alpha and 16-beta testosterone hydroxylases.",

It preferentially distributes to adipose tissue and other organs with high fat content.

Other metabolites include less chlorinated benzenes, chlorophenols, S-conjugated phenols, and benzenes. Hexachlorobenzene is slowly metabolized in mammals, and the majority of hexachlorobenzene is excreted unchanged in the feces, while metabolites are excreted in the urine. (L225)",

It is a dioxin-like compound and a weak ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We have found that HCB activates c-Src/HER1/STAT5b and HER1/ERK1/2 signaling pathways and cell migration, in an AhR-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the effect of HCB (0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5uM) on cell invasion and metalloproteases (MMPs) 2 and 9 activation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, we examined in vivo the effect of HCB (0.3, 3, 30mg/kg bw) on tumor growth, MMP2 and MMP9 expression, and metastasis using MDA-MB-231 xenografts and two syngeneic mouse breast cancer models (spontaneous metastasis using C4-HI and lung experimental metastasis using LM3). /The/ results show that HCB (5uM) enhances MMP2 expression, as well as cell invasion, through AhR, c-Src/HER1 pathway and MMPs. Moreover, HCB increases MMP9 expression, secretion and activity through a HER1 and AhR-dependent mechanism, in MDA-MB-231 cells. HCB (0.3 and 3mg/kg bw) enhances subcutaneous tumor growth in MDA-MB-231 and C4-HI in vivo models. In vivo, using MDA-MB-231 model, the pesticide (0.3, 3 and 30mg/kg bw) activated c-Src, HER1, STAT5b, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and increased MMP2 and MMP9 protein levels. Furthermore, /the authors/ observed that HCB stimulated lung metastasis regardless the tumor hormone-receptor status ... /suggesting/ that HCB may be a risk factor for human breast cancer progression.",

Catalytic activity decreased progressively as porphyria developed but was not accompanied by a fall in the concentration of immunoreactive enzyme protein. These findings suggest that HCB specifically inactivates uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase without affecting those regions of the molecule that determine its antigenic activity and without increasing its rate of catabolism. In vitro, uroporphyrin-catalysed photoinactivation of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was similarly unaccompanied by loss of immunoreactivity, whereas reaction of sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide led to loss of both catalytic activity and immunoreactivity. HCB may induce chronic porphyria by modifying sulfhydryl groups in the enzyme; the effect is restricted to catalytic or substrate-binding sites.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this white crystalline substance may occur from its use as a fungicide, and as an intermediate or additive in the production of rubber, polyvinyl chloride, pyrotechnic compositions, dyes, and pentachlorophenol. Effects from exposure may include dermal irritation, CNS excitation, seizures, pneumonitis, and respiratory depression. Also, it should be noted that the EPA Carcinogen Assessment Group has placed hexachlorobenzene on a list of substances that it considers possibly carcinogenic to humans. Likewise, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) considers the substance to be possibly carcinogenic to humans. In activities or situations where over exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and protective clothing. If contact should occur, immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While hexachlorobenzene does not ignite easily, it can burn with the production of irritating and poisonous gases. Fires involving hexachlorobenzene may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Hexachlorobenzene may be shipped via air, rail, road, and water in containers bearing the label, \"Keep away from food\". Small spills of hexachlorobenzene may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible material, and placed into containers for later disposal. Large spills should first be diked far ahead of the spill. Hexachlorobenzene is a potential candidate for rotary kiln incineration. Before implementing land disposal of waste hexachlorobenzene, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Patients subsequently developed bullae on sun-exposed areas, hyperpigmentation, hirsutism, weakness, and porphyrinuria. Children born to mothers who had ingested the grain were exposed transplacentally or through maternal milk to hexachlorobenzene resulting in the death of children under the age of two. In this follow-up study, 204 patients with a past history of hexachlorobenzene-induced porphyria were re-evaluated. There were 132 males and 72 females, with an average age of 32.1 yr, an average age on onset of 7.1 yr and a duration of 2.4 yr. The clinical features of the 204 patients were: scarring of the face and hands in 86.7%, hyperpigmentation in 71.1%, hirsutism in 47.1%, pinched faces in 41.2%, fragile skin in 37.7%, painless arthritis in 66.6%, small hands in 64.2%, an enlarged liver in 4.4%, and an enlarged thyroid in 37.3%; most patients also showed neurological symptoms. Urine and stool porphyrin levels were determined in all patients. Seventeen showed elevated levels of one of the porphyrins and eight were still porphyric after 25-30 yr. A total of 56 specimens of human milk obtained from porphyric mothers showed average values of 0.51 ppm hexachlorobenzene compared with 0.07 in controls. After hexachlorobenzene ingestion, abnormal prphyrin metabolism, dermatological, orthopedic and neurological findings, and HCB residues in the milk of porphyric patients persist at least 25-30 years.",

Hexachlorobenzene is readily absorbed by the oral route in experimental animals and poorly via the skin. ... In animals and humans, hexachlorobenzene accumulates in lipid-rich tissues, such as adipose tissue, adrenal cortex, bone marrow, skin and some endocrine tissues, and can be transferred to offspring both across the placenta and via mothers' milk. Hexachlorobenzene undergoes limited metabolism, yielding pentachlorophenol, tetrachlorohydroquinone and pentachlorothiophenol as the major metabolites in urine.... The acute toxicity of hexachlorobenzene to experimental animals is low ... In animal studies, hexachlorobenzene is not a skin or eye irritant ... The available data on the systemic toxicity of hexachlorobenzene indicate that the pathway for the biosynthesis of heme is a major target of hexachlorobenzene toxicity. Elevated levels of porphyrin and/or porphyrin precursors have been found in the liver, other tissues and excreta of several species of laboratory mammals ... Porphyria has been reported in a number of studies in rats with subchronic or chronic oral exposure ... Repeated exposure to hexachlorobenzene has also been shown to affect a wide range of organ systems (including the liver, lungs, kidneys, thyroid, skin and nervous and immune systems) although these have been reported less frequently than porphyria. Hexachlorobenzene is a mixed-type cytochrome P-450-inducing compound, with phenobarbital-inducible and 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible properties. It is known to bind to the Ah receptor. ...

The results of a number of studies have indicated that hexachlorobenzene affects the immune system .... Most data on the effects of hexachlorobenzene on humans originate from accidental poisonings that took place in Turkey in 1955-1959, in which more than 600 cases of porphyria cutanea tarda were identified. In this incident, disturbances in porphyrin metabolism, dermatological lesions, hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, enlarged liver, enlargement of the thyroid gland and lymph nodes, and (in roughly half the cases) osteoporosis or arthritis were observed, primarily in children. Breast-fed infants of mothers exposed to hexachlorobenzene in this incident developed a disorder called pembe yara (pink sore) and most died within a year. There is also limited evidence that porphyria cutanea tarda occurs in humans with relatively high exposure to hexachlorobenzene in the workplace or in the general environment.

This inhibits uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, resulting in a deficiency of the decarboxylation of uroporphyrinogen III and accumulation of uroporphyrins in the liver. In addition, metabolism of hexachlorobenzene by the cytochrome P-450 enzymes is believed to produce reactive electrophilic metabolites that covalently bind to cellular proteins and DNA, causing irreversible damage. Exposure to hexochlorobenzene also causes macrophages to be attracted to organs such as the spleen, lungs, and skin, where they become activated by the hexochlorobenzene. This leads to a cascade of reactions involving innate immune cells. The gene expression profiles provide evidence for the importance of macrophages and granulocytes and mediators released by these cells in the adverse inflammatory response against hexochlorobenzene. In this way, co-stimulatory or danger signals are generated that could polyclonally activate T cells. Hexachlorobenzene is a weak agonist for aryl hydrocarbon receptor and may exhibit some of its toxic effects by activating the gene-regulatory properties of this protein, possibly inducing cytochome P-450 enzymes. It may also act at certain endocrine receptors. (A14, L225, A156, A157, A60)",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on diets containing hexachlorobenzene (HCB) at 30 mg/kg by gavage every 72 hr. After 20 days of treatment, rats were given an ip dose of carbon tetrachloride at up to 2.0 ml/kg. Growth, renal function, and hepatocellular damage were compared to those rats receiving carbon tetrachloride without pretreatment. Survival after various ip doses of carbon tetrachloride was determined in rats with pretreatments with HCB. HCB increased the susceptibility of the rats to the toxic effects of carbon tetrachloride. Growth retardation induced by carbon tetrachloride was more severe in pretreated rats. Renal tubular function was more impaired in pretreated rats although only minor histological changes due to carbon tetrachloride were apparent in the kidneys. Morphological liver injury and hepatocellular necrosis were more severe in the animals pretreated with HCB. Survival after acute doses of carbon tetrachloride was reduced in animals pretreated with HCB. It was concluded that the toxicity of carbon tetrachloride is potentiated by prior exposure to HCB.",

The results obtained show that the repeated injection of desferrioxamine (three times a week: 100 mg/kg each im) delayed and diminished remarkably the urinary excretion of precursors and porphyrins as well as the accumulation of the latter in liver promoted by HCB (1 g/kg daily given by stomach tube). This was probably due to attenuation by desferrioxamine of the alterations produced by the fungicide in the two key enzymes: porphyrinogen carboxylase and delta-aminolevulinate synthase. In fact, deferrioxamine by reducing liver iron levels produced a smaller decrease of the target enzyme and a concomitant smaller induction of delta-aminolevulinate synthase. Desferrioxamine alone did not modify any of these variables or the liver to body weight ratio. Desferrioxamine added at 10(-2) and 10(-3) M to the incubation media of delta-aminolaevulinate synthase and porphyrinogen carboxylyase did not alter either of the enzymatic activities, whether in normal or HCB-porphyric preparations.",

The two initial signs of porphyria turcica neurotoxicity are extreme weakness and myotonia on forearm percussion. A high incidence of axonal neuropathy in acute intermittent porphyria has been demonstrated. Long-term neurotoxicity symptoms of porphyria turcica were discussed including disturbed porphyrin metabolism, elevation of alpha-aminolevulinic acid, sensory motor neuropathy, myotonia, and early extrapyramidal signs. Neuropsychiatric evaluations have indicated an increase frequency of schizophrenia and hypochondria in porphyria turcica patients. Intravenous injection of porphyrin and its precursors has been shown not to produce toxic effects in laboratory animals and high porphyrin levels have not always correlated with clinical symptoms.",

The subacute toxicity of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) /was studied/ in Charles River rats fed diets providing dosages of 0.5, 2, 8, and 32 mg of the compound in corn oil per kilogram of body weight per day. Subgroups of rats were killed at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days of feeding. At 15 weeks the remaining rats were then fed a compound free diet and sacrificed after 1, 2, 4, 16, and 33 weeks. Signs of intoxication were dose related and included excessive irritability, tremors, alopecia, and nonspecific dermal changes with slight scabbing at sites displaying alopecia. Ataxia with hind leg paralysis and loss of pain response in the legs were seen in a few females at the daily 32 mg/kg dose level after 6 and 9 weeks of treatment. In males and females, tremors disappeared after 3-4 weeks of feeding; all other signs of intoxication disappeared by 9 weeks.",

Another 20 rats were kept on normal diet/. The inducement of skin changes was attempted through repeated exposure of the skin of HCB-induced porphyric rats to sunlight. The following skin changes were produced in the porphyric rats; erythema, erosion, crust, skin thickening and scarring. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of acanthosis, vacuolization of the malpighian cells, subepidermal vesicle, fibrosis, dilatation and increase of the blood vessels and perivascular cell infiltration composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and mast cells. The PAS stainability of blood vessel walls was slightly intensified. The assumption is that photosensitive flares were elicited within the short 2-month period though destruction of endothelial cells was not prominent. There were no distinct skin changes, clinically or histopathologically, in any of the three control groups.",

Subjecting the animals to a 10-day period of food restriction immediately following 21 days of dosing further increased residues, but obscured any differences due to dosing regimen. Liver and hepatocyte enlargement, as well as physiologic changes in the central nervous system, were HCB-induced. Weight loss and various hematological changes were equivocal, with dietary stress and HCB probably contributing to the changes to varying degrees.

Although hexachlorobenzene is not currently manufactured as a commercial end product in the United States, it is still being generated inadvertently as a by-product and/or impurity in several chemical processes, such as the manufacture of chlorinated solvents, chlorinated aromatics and pesticides. Hexachlorobenzene is released directly to the environment by incomplete combustion processes and releases from old dumpsites. Its former use as a pesticide released it directly to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.72X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates hexachlorobenzene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Monitoring studies have demonstrated that the vapor-phase generally predominates. Vapor-phase hexachlorobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 1.6 years. Vapor-phase photolysis is not expected to be an important fate process. Detection in rain and snow indicate hexachlorobenzene can be removed from air by wet deposition. Particulate-phase hexachlorobenzene may also be removed by dry deposition. If released to soil, hexachlorobenzene is expected to be immobile based upon a measured log Koc range of 3.6 to 5.5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.8X10-4 atm-cu m/mole, although strong adsorption will attenuate volatilization. Hexachlorobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Hexachlorobenzene is persistent to either abiotic or biodegradation processes in soil. One study measured a half-life of 3-6 years for hexachlorobenzene in soils. If released into water, hexachlorobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.5 hours and 7.5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond (2 m deep) is estimated as approximately 5 years if adsorption is considered. A BCF range of 1,600 to 30,000 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hexachlorobenzene is resistant to aerobic biodegradation. Anaerobic biodegradation in water-sediment varies widely with half-lives ranging from weeks to years with an intermediate value of roughly 1.7 years. Hydrolysis is not an important fate process. Photolysis half-lives in shallow water exposed to sunlight may be on the order of 70 days. Occupational exposure to hexachlorobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexachlorobenzene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hexachlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. A main exposure pathway for the general public to hexachlorobenzene is from the ingestion of food, including fish caught in contaminated areas, and the ingestion of contaminated breast milk for infants.

Hexachlorobenzene is also released directly to the environment by incomplete combustion, and releases from old dumpsites(2). Volatilization of hexachlorobenzene in the soil from past contamination (such as pesticide uses) is another potential source of atmospheric emission(2). Hexachlorobenzene's former use as a pesticide and fungicide (2,3) resulted in its direct release to the environment(SRC).

Volatilization of hexachlorobenzene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 5.8X10-4 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(5). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Hexachlorobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.72X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). Hexachlorobenzene is persistent to either abiotic or biodegradation processes in soil(7). One study measured a half-life (first-order kinetics) of 3-6 years for hexachlorobenzene in soils(7,8). The half-life for residence of hexachlorobenzene in soil has been estimated to be 970-2100 days with the major loss process from soil at the surface being volatilization(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.8X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5), but adsorption is expected to attenuate this process(SRC). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7.5 hours and 7.5 days, respectively, if adsorption is ignored(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond (2 m deep) is approximately 5 years if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values in the range of 1,600 to 30,000 in fish(8) suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hexachlorobenzene is resistant to aerobic biodegradation(8). Anaerobic biodegradation in water-sediment varies widely with half-lives ranging from weeks to years(8) with an intermediate value of roughly 1.7 years(8). Hydrolysis is not an important fate process for hexachlorobenzene(8). Photolysis half-lives in shallow water exposed to sunlight may be on the order of 70 days(8).",

Monitoring studies have demonstrated that the vapor phase generally predominates(3). Vapor-phase hexachlorobenzene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.6 years(SRC) from its rate constant of 2.7X10-14 cu cm/molec-sec(SRC). Results of vapor phase photolysis studies indicate direct photolysis is not expected to be an important fate process in the atmosphere(3). Particulate-phase hexachlorobenzene may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Hexachlorobenzene has been detected in many precipitation monitoring studies (both rain water and snow)(4); therefore, removal from air occurs via wet deposition(SRC).",

The anaerobic half-life of hexachlorobenzene was reported as approximately 10 years in fresh waters(1). A culturally enriched anaerobic microbial consortium was shown to biodegrade hexachlorobenzene with reported half-lives in the range of several days to a few weeks, but the native anaerobic microbial population (from Lake Ketelmeer sediment) was shown to biodegrade hexachlorobenzene more slowly, with a maximum half-life of about 7 years(2). Hexachlorobenzene was dechlorinated to tri- and dichlorobenzenes in an acclimated anaerobic sewage sludge over a 3 week incubation period(3). Pseudo first-order rate constants of hexachlorobenzene in sediment slurries amended with nonionic surfactants were reported in the range of 0.017 to 0.005 days-1, corresponding to half-lives of about 41 to 139 days(4). Hexachlorobenzene was biodegraded by acclimated anaerobic sediment obtained from the Tsurumi River, Japan with a biodegradation half-life of 28 days and the following biodegradation products: pentachlorbenzene; >1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetrachlorobenzene; >1,3,5-trichlorobenzene; >1,2,4-trichlorobenzene; >1,3-dichlorobenzene; >1,4-dichlorobenzene and monochlorobenzene(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.6 years at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(SRC). The photo-oxidation half-life (first-order kinetics) of hexachlorobenzene was estimated (first-order kinetics) to be 0.63 years (230 days), 1.94 years (708 days), and 6.28 years (2,292 days) in air in tropical/subtropical regions, temperate/boreal regions, and polar regions, respectively(2). Photodegradation of hexachlorobenzene in its vapor phase, or as an adsorbable on silica gel, has been reported as not occurring when hexachlorobenzene was irradiated with ultraviolet radiation of wavelength 290 nm for 6 days(3). Hexachlorobenzene was shown to photodegrade when dipped onto a nano-titanium dioxide film and exposed to light >290 nm(3). Hexachlorobenzene absorbs UV light >290 nm and has been shown to photodegrade in water-acetonitrile solution when exposed to light >290 nm(4). Surface water photolysis studies have suggested that photolysis of hexachlorobenzene is a feasible loss process with half-lives ranging from 6.17 to 70 days with 70 days being a more representative environmental half-life(3). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important fate process for hexachlorobenzene(3); one study observed zero hydrolysis after 13 days for pH values of 3, 7, and 11 at 85 \u00b0C(3).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that hexachlorobenzene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 7.5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 7.5 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 5 years if adsorption is considered(3). Hexachlorobenzene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC), however, strong adsorption to soil will attenuate its importance as an environmental fate process. Hexachlorobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1.72X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4).",

Occupational exposure to hexachlorobenzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexachlorobenzene is produced or used. Occupational exposure is possible for workers involved in the production of chlorinated hydrocarbons, which releases hexachlorobenzene as a byproduct(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hexachlorobenzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water(SRC). A main exposure pathway for the general public to hexachlorobenzene is from the ingestion of food, including fish caught in contaminated areas, and the ingestion of contaminated (<1 ppb of hexachlorobenzene) in breast milk for infants(2). Members of the general population may be exposed to very low concentrations of hexachlorobenzene through ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs, particularly those with high lipid content such as meat, poultry, and fish(2). General population exposure to hexachlorobenzene via inhalation or dermal contact would be much less(2).",

In the 1970s, restrictions on HCB use as a fungicide for cereal grains were initiated, but there are other uses and releases from chemical manufacturing industries and waste disposal operations. Representative values for HCB in environmental media and in man have been used in an exposure commitment assessment. The human body burden of HCB, estimated at 0.7 mg, is derived mainly from dietary intake of fatty foods, diet contributing approximately 0.2 ug/day. Inhalation is estimated to contribute about two orders of magnitude less. The assessment indicates a low exposure to HCB from the general environment, but populations exposed to direct contamination have had increased intake via one or both pathways.",

Although the mechanism of plasmodicidal action has not been fully elucidated, like other quinoline derivatives, amodiaquine likely is able to inhibit heme polymerase activity in the body. This results in accumulation of free heme, which is toxic to the parasites.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Sixteen additional cases of agranulocytosis from Western Europe associated with the use of amodiaquine have recently been reported to the drug manufacturer, and two U.S. cases have been reported to CDC. Twenty-three of these 25 cases occurred in 1985 or 1986, and seven are reported to have been fatal. Among 20 cases for which the duration of amodiaquine prophylaxis is known, usage ranged from 3 weeks to 24 weeks. In all but four of the 25 cases, amodiaquine was used at the appropriate dosage (adults 400 mg base per week) for prophylaxis. Fourteen of the patients are known to have used another antimalarial drug concurrently for prophylaxis ... It is now apparent that any possible prophylactic advantage that amodiaquine may afford is not justified by the possible risk of agranulocytosis associated with the use of the drug. CDC, therefore, no longer recommends that amodiaquine be used for prophylaxis.",

After intraportal administration (54 mumol/kg) to the anaesthetized rat, the drug was excreted in bile (23 +/- 3% dose over 5 h; mean +/- SD, n = 6) primarily as thioether conjugates.  After intraportal administration, 20% of the dose was excreted into urine over 24 h as parent compound and products of N-dealkylation and oxidative deamination. Desethylamodiaquine accumulated in liver, but was not a substrate for bioactivation as measured by biliary elimination of a glutathione adduct.  Prior administration of ketoconazole, an inhibitor of P450, reduced biliary excretion by 50% and effected a corresponding decrease in the amount of drug irreversibly bound to liver proteins. This indicated a role for P450 in the bioactivation of amodiaquine to a reactive metabolite that conjugates with glutathione and protein.  De-ethylation and irreversible binding were observed in vitro using male rat liver microsomes, and were again inhibited by ketoconazole. However, no such binding was observed with human (six individuals) hepatic microsomes despite extensive turnover of amodiaquine to desethylamodiaquine.  Amodiaquine quinoneimine underwent rapid reduction in the presence of either human or rat liver microsomes. Therefore in vitro studies may underestimate the bioactivation of amodiaquine in vivo. These data indicate that the extent of protein adduct formation in the liver will depend on the relative rates of oxidation of amodiaquine and reduction of its quinoneimine. This in turn may be a predisposing factor in the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity associated with amodiaquine.  Substitution of a fluorine for the phenolic hydroxyl group in amodiaquine blocked bioactivation of the drug in vivo. Insertion of an N-hydroxyethyl function enabled partial clearance of amodiaquine and its deshydroxyfluoro analogue via O-glucuronidation and altered the balance between phase I oxidation and direct phase II conjugation of amodiaquine.",

Using human liver microsomes and two sets of recombinant human cytochrome P450 isoforms (from lymphoblastoids and yeast) /the authors/ performed studies to identify the CYP isoform(s) involved in the metabolism of AQ. CYP2C8 was the main hepatic isoform that cleared AQ and catalyzed the formation of DEAQ. The extrahepatic P450s, 1A1 and 1B1, also cleared AQ and catalyzed the formation of an unknown metabolite M2. The K(m) and V(max) values for AQ N-desethylation were 1.2 microM and 2.6 pmol/min/pmol of CYP2C8 for recombinant CYP2C8, and 2.4 microM and 1462 pmol/min/mg of protein for human liver microsomes (HLMs), respectively. Relative contribution of CYP2C8 in the formation of DEAQ was estimated at 100% using the relative activity factor method. Correlation analyses between AQ metabolism and the activities of eight hepatic P450s were made on 10 different HLM samples. Both the formation of DEAQ and the clearance of AQ showed excellent correlations (r(2) = 0.98 and 0.95) with 6alpha-hydroxylation of paclitaxel, a marker substrate for CYP2C8. The inhibition of DEAQ formation by quercetin was competitive with K(i) values of 1.96 for CYP2C8 and 1.56 microM for HLMs. Docking of AQ into the active site homology models of the CYP2C isoforms showed favorable interactions with CYP2C8, which supported the likelihood of an N-desethylation reaction. These data show that CYP2C8 is the main hepatic isoform responsible for the metabolism of AQ. The specificity, high affinity, and high turnover make AQ desethylation an excellent marker reaction for CYP2C8 activity.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

More importantly, there have been multiple reports of idiosyncratic acute liver injury due to amodiaquine. The onset of injury is usually within 1 to 4 months and is often associated with agranulocytosis. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations is most frequently hepatocellular, and symptoms resembling acute viral hepatitis are typical. Features of hypersensitivity are uncommon, as are autoantibodies. The hepatitis can be severe, and several fatal instances or cases requiring emergency liver transplantation have been reported. The frequency of serious hepatic injury is estimated to be ~1:15,000. Because of the risks of agranulocytosis and liver injury, amodiaquine is no longer recommended for use as prophylaxis against malaria and is used largely for therapy in endemic areas outside of the United States. General recommendations on the therapy of malaria including specific details on diagnosis, management, drug dosage and safety are available at the CDC website: http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/.",

ECG should be monitored. Because of the importance of supporting respiration, early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Early gastric lavage may provide some benefit in reducing absorption of the drugs, but generally should be preceded by measures to correct severe cardiovascular disturbances, if present, and by respiratory support that includes endotracheal intubation with cuff inflated and in place to prevent aspiration (since seizures may occur). IV diazepam may control seizures and other manifestations of cerebral stimulation and, possibly, may prevent or minimize other toxic effects (eg, cardiotoxicity, including ECG abnormalities and conduction disturbances) of 4-aminoquinoline derivatives. However, additional study and experience are necessary to further establish the effects of diazepam on noncerebral manifestations of toxicity with these drugs. If seizures are caused by anoxia, anoxia should be corrected with oxygen and respiratory support. Equipment and facilities for cardioversion and for insertion of a transvenous pacemaker should be readily available. Administration of IV fluids and placement of the patient in Trendelenburg's position may be useful in managing hypotension, but more aggressive therapy, including administration of vasopressors (eg, epinephrine, isoproterenol, dopamine), may be necessary, particularly if shock appears to be impending.",

Toxicity toward MNL was assessed after 2 hr and 16 hr incubations with each compound. After 2 hr, AQ, AQm and AQQI but not CQ (within the concentration range 1 to 100 umol/L) produced a significant decrease in cell viability. After 16 hr, all four compounds significantly increased cell death. After both 2 hr and 16 hr incubations CQ was the least toxic and AQQI the most toxic of the four compounds towards MNL. Toxicity to GM-CFU was assessed by the inhibition of colony formation in vitro. After 10 to 14 days incubation, there was significant concentration-dependent inhibition of colony formation by AQ, AQm, AQQI and CQ (within the range 0.1 to 10.0 umol/L). There were no significant differences between the ability of the four compounds to inhibit colony formation but toxicity towards GM-CFU was observed at drug concentrations at least 10-fold lower than those that were toxic to MNL. These data show that the four compounds are equally toxic in vitro toward GM-CFU, although some differences in their toxicity toward MNL were seen.",

Amodiaquine is associated with less pruritus and is more palatable than chloroquine, but is associated with a much higher risk of agranulocytosis and, to a lesser degree, of hepatitis when used for prophylaxis. The risk of a serious adverse reaction with prophylactic use (which is no longer recommended) appears to be between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 5,000. It is not clear whether the risks are lower when amodiaquine is used to treat malaria. Following overdose cardiotoxicity appears to be less frequent than with chloroquine. Large doses of amodiaquine have been reported to cause syncope, spasticity, convulsions and involuntary movements.",

Symptoms of overdosage of 4-aminoquinoline derivatives include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting, cardiovascular collapse, and seizures followed by sudden and early respiratory and cardiac arrest. Hypotension, if not treated, may progress rapidly to shock. Electrocardiograms (ECG) may reveal atrial standstill, nodal rhythm, prolonged intraventricular conduction time, and progressive bradycardia leading to ventricular fibrillation and/or arrest.",

Specific IgG anti-amodiaquine antibodies were detected after administration of the drug to rats (269 mumols/kg for 4 days), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay employing amodiaquine conjugated to metallothionein as an antigen. A positive immune response was observed regardless of the route of administration, but the magnitude of the response in terms of antibody titre was in the order intraperitoneal administration greater than intramuscular administration greater than oral administration. Hapten inhibition experiments with structurally related drugs defined the specificity of the antibody which appears to recognize a conjugate of amodiaquine quinone imine and cysteine residues present in protein. Amodiaquine was converted to a protein-reactive species by activated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro, and this may provide a mechanism for immunogen formation in vivo. A humoral immune response was observed with doses of amodiaquine that did not produce either direct hepatotoxicity or leukopenia.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

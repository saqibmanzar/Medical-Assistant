PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Nystatin has a greater antifungal activity than amphotericin B - parenterally administered nystatin, however, is associated with significant toxicity and is not available in a formulation appropriate for systemic use.

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Prescriptions before spontaneous abortions were compared with those in the first trimester of deliveries and with those before legal abortions. No statistically significant association was observed with any of these agents for the overall frequency of birth defects or for specific birth defects analyzed (cardiovascular defects, oral clefts, and spina bifida). Two hundred fifty miconazole exposures among 4264 spontaneous abortions, compared with 2236 in the first trimester of 55,736 deliveries, provided an estimated relative risk of 1.4 (95% confidence limits 1.2-1.5). One hundred twelve treatments with clotrimazole among the spontaneous abortions, compared with 1086 among the deliveries, provided a relative risk of 1.4 (95% confidence limits 1.1-1.6). In contrast, large numbers of exposures to nystatin and aminacrine compounds did not show this association, suggesting that spontaneous abortions are caused by the imidazole agents miconazole and clotrimazole rather than the condition being treated. Because many associations were examined without previous hypotheses, and because the data were inadequate to show an elevated risk for clotrimazole when comparing spontaneous with legal abortion exposures, these findings are considered to be a signal for further studies rather than definitive in themselves.",

Nystatin is formed from Streptomyces noursei, S aureus, and other Streptomyces species. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.7X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates nystatin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase nystatin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 hours. Reaction with ozone is also expected to occur; the half-life for this reaction is estimated to be 2.6 hours. Particulate-phase nystatin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Nystatin may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, nystatin is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 170. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Nystatin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. A 4% degradation in 28 days using the Closed Bottle test indicates that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, nystatin is expected to adsorb slightly to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 22 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to nystatin may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where nystatin is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to nystatin via use of antimicrobial products containing nystatin. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.0X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 22(SRC), from its water solubility and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 4% degradation in 28 days using the Closed Bottle test(7) indicates that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

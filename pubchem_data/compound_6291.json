The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Mestranol itself does not bind significantly to estrogen receptors at the sites of their antifertility action; its hormonal effectiveness relies on transformation to ethinyloestradiol. About 35% of a mestranol dose is transformed into ethinyloestradiol in rats, 61% in mice, 56% in rabbits and 54% in man. The demethylated portion then follows the pathways for ethinyloestradiol that are typical for the particular species, e.g., 2-hydroxylation in rats and D-homoannulation in rabbits and guinea-pigs. Mestranol is also demethylated to ethinylestradiol in non-human primates.",

Ethinylestradiol is orally bio-active and the estrogen used in almost all modern formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills.  It binds to (and activates) the estrogen receptor. Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70%.  Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).",

Biologic response is initiated when estrogen binds to a ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor resulting in a conformational change that leads to gene transcription through specific estrogen response elements (ERE) of target gene promoters; subsequent activation or repression of the target gene is mediated through 2 distinct transactivation domains (ie, AF-1 and AF-2) of the receptor. The estrogen receptor also mediates gene transcription using different response elements (ie, AP-1) and other signal pathways. Recent advances in the molecular pharmacology of estrogen and estrogen receptors have resulted in the development of selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, clomiphene, raloxifene, tamoxifen, toremifene), agents that bind and activate the estrogen receptor but that exhibit tissue-specific effects distinct from estrogen. Tissue-specific estrogen-agonist or -antagonist activity of these drugs appears to be related to structural differences in their estrogen receptor complex (eg, specifically the surface topography of AF-2 for raloxifene) compared with the estrogen (estradiol)-estrogen receptor complex. A second estrogen receptor also has been identified, and existence of at least 2 estrogen receptors (ER-alpha, ER-beta) may contribute to the tissue-specific activity of selective modulators. While the role of the estrogen receptor in bone, cardiovascular tissue, and the CNS continues to be studied, emerging evidence indicates that the mechanism of action of estrogen receptors in these tissues differs from the manner in which estrogen receptors function in reproductive tissue. /Estrogen General Statement/",

Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70%.\n\n\n\nEstrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).",

Although an increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the endometrium has been associated with sequential oral contraceptive use (sequential oral contraceptives are no longer available in the US), no association between increased risk of endometrial cancer and use of currently available estrogen-progestin combination preparations or progestin-only preparations has been shown, although individual cases have been reported. The Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) showed that women who used estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives had decreased relative risk of epithelial endometrial cancer (ie, adenocarcinoma, adenoacanthoma, and adenosquamous cancers) compared with nonusers; the protective effect occurred in women who had used combination oral contraceptives for at least 12 months, and it persisted for at least 15 years after discontinuance of oral contraceptives. This decreased risk of endometrial cancer was not evident in women who had used oral contraceptives for less than 12 months."

Diethylnitrosamine-initiated and 0.85% NaCl solution-treated noninitiated female Sprague-Dawley rats were transferred to semisynthetic diets containing mestranol (0, 0.1, or 0.5 ppm), ethinyl estradiol (0.5 ppm), estradiol (0.6 ppm), or mestranol plus beta-methasone (0.5 and 0.2 ppm, respectively). gamma-Glutamyl transferase (GGT)-positive transections and hematoxylin and eosin-detectable nodules and carcinomas were scored at 9 and 12 months. Quantitative stereological calculations were performed to determine GGT lesion number and size. At 9 months, in diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats, ethinyl estradiol and mestranol caused 3.5- and 4.4-fold increases, respectively, in the number of GGT lesions per liver and an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas while estradiol had no enhancing effect. Addition of beta-methasone to the mestranol-containing diet caused a significant decrease in GGT lesion number but not carcinoma incidence compared to mestranol alone. At 12 months, in diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats, mestranol caused a dose-dependent increase in GGT lesion number. The hepatocellular carcinoma incidence was significantly increased at the high mestranol dose. Small increases in the numbers of larger GGT lesions were also observed in noninitiated animals treated with mestranol and ethinyl estradiol and are most probably due to promotion of spontaneously initiated hepatocytes. These results indicated that the synthetic estrogens cause dramatic increases in the number of presumptive preneoplastic GGT lesions. Carcinoma incidence is also enhanced. ...",

In women who developed myopia at or near puberty and in whom myopia became stable in adulthood, the drugs have reportedly increased the refractive error 2- to 3-fold, usually after 6 months of use. In women who are myopic and have considerable astigmatism, oral contraceptives may produce marked changes in the astigmatic error, possibly leading to frank keratoconus. In addition, oral contraceptives may produce a rapid advancement of the ocular disorder in patients with a family history of marked myopic astigmatism or keratoconus. Contact lens wearers receiving estrogen-progestin contraceptives may have more difficulties with their contact lenses than do nonusers who wear contact lenses. Contact lens wearers who develop visual disturbances or changes in lens tolerance during estrogen-progestin contraceptive use should be assessed by an ophthalmologist; temporary or permanent cessation of contact lens wear should be considered. /Estrogen-Progestin Combination/"

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.7X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates mestranol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase mestranol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Mestranol absorbs at wavelengths of 287.5 nm, and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, mestranol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.2X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.5X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Mestranol was greater than 90% removed in the sewage treatment process; however, 99.80% attributed to sludge adsorbance indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, mestranol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 500 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to mestranol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where mestranol is produced or used. Exposure to mestranol via ingestion will occur when administered drugs containing this compound. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to mestranol at well below the therapeutic dose via ingestion of drinking water. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Mestranol exhibited a sorption coefficient (log Kd) of 2.26 using Blackwater estuary sediments and Thames River sediments, UK(3). The compound was not detected in the effluent of a 23-day column drainage study using Mahall-Laveen sandy loam soil from an area northwest of Phoenix, AZ and 200 L of treated effluent from a municipal waste treatment facility; reporting limit = 0.005 ug/L(4), suggesting adsorption to soil in the column(SRC). A log Koc of 5.85 was measured in a sewage treatment process, corresponding to a Koc of 707,397. Mestranol was greater than 90% removed in the sewage treatment process, with 99.80% attributed to sludge adsorbance(5).",

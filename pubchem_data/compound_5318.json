                        "Description": "A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols and numbers. PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Against pathogenic yeasts such as dermatophytes and Aspergilli, sulconazole had similar RIF values compared to other imidazoles. In _in vitro_ conditions, the fungicidal potency of sulconazole depends on its concentration and the growth phase of the inoculum cells.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The function of imidazoles can be attributed to their structural resemblance to purines essential to metabolism. Imidazoles inhibit lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme in fungi responsible for converting lanosterol to ergosterol. Since ergosterol is required to maintain the integrity of the fungi membrane, the inhibition of lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase leads to increased fungal cellular permeability. Therefore, the use of an imidazole such as sulconazole inhibits fungal growth.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

                                "Description": "This section provides information on the density (with unit) and specific gravity (without unit) of a compound. Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A 50% mortality rate was obtained at the longest exposure to 15 mg/L. Sex related differences in the blood levels of PA and pinacolone were noted, and the surviving male rats failed to gain weight normally in the first week after exposure. In rats exposed to 5.0 mg/L for 6 hours, there were reductions in horizontal and vertical activity and the minute volume was 55% of controls at the end of exposure. Like many secondary alcohols, PA poses only a possible inhalation hazard; however, male rats may be somewhat more susceptible than females. /Pinacolyl alcohol/",

Using Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic studies, enhancement was found to occur with liver carboxylesterase and procaine esterase, but not with aniline hydroxylase. Since the soman-enzyme complex was known to undergo aging with the release of pinacolyl alcohol and the subsequent formation of pinacolone, the effects of these metabolites on the activity of liver microsomal enzymes in vitro were explored. Pinacolone and pinacolyl alcohol produced enzyme enhancement in vitro in a manner similar to that produced by soman pretreatment. These effects were compared with those made by acetone in the same incubations, since the enhancing influence of acetone has already been well documented. Similarity was found between the in vitro effects of acetone and the effects of pinacolone and pinacolyl alcohol. Lastly, the in vivo effects of pinacolone on the activities of the same liver microsomal enzymes were studied following pretreatment of the guinea pigs with 90% LDLo (lowest published lethal dose) pinacolone. Pretreating guinea pigs with pinacolone prior to killing them enhanced liver microsomal carboxylesterase and procaine esterase activities, but had no effect on microsomal aniline hydroxylase activity. This pattern of enzyme enhancement was similar to that observed after soman pretreatment. Therefore, soman was found to enhance hepatic microsomal esterase activity in the guinea pig in a manner similar to that seen with its metabolites, as well as acetone. ...",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 31.5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14 days. 3,3-Dimethyl-2-butanone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 110. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 3,3-Dimethyl-2-butanone may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 7 hours and 5.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 7 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5.2 days(SRC). 3,3-Dimethyl-2-butanone's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

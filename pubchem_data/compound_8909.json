Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Withdraw immediately in case of rising sound from venting safety devices or discoloration of tank. ALWAYS stay away from tanks in direct contact with flames. For massive fire, use unmanned master stream devices or monitor nozzles; if this is impossible, withdraw from area and let fire burn. (ERG, 2024)",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (280+/-20 g) were divided into groups of seven animals each and were administered by gavage low (2 mg/kg body weight), medium (20 mg/kg) or high (200 mg/kg) doses of BE, EHxE, or MHpE, 5 d/wk for 4 weeks. Another group of animals was administered DMH at 200 mg/kg while the control group received the vehicle (corn oil at 1 mL/100 g bw) only. At the end of the treatment period, relative testis weights and thymus weights were significantly decreased in the DMH group but not in animals receiving BE, EHxE, or MHpE. Microscopic examination revealed degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and reduction of sperm density in the epididymides in the DMH treatment group. Urinary creatine/creatinine ratio, a sensitive indicator of testicular damage, was markedly elevated in the DMH treated animals but not in those treated with BE, EHxE, or MHpE. In the bone marrow, DMH caused mild dyserythropoiesis and dysthrombopoiesis, while BE, EHxE, and MHpE produced mild increases in granulocytes and myelocyte/erythrocyte ratio. All four ethers at 200 mg/kg caused mild histological changes in the thyroid but no significant modulation in the circulating thyroxin (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3) levels. All four ethers produced hepatic effects at 200 mg/kg consisting of mild, adaptive histological changes, increased urinary ascorbic acid output, and elevation in the activities of one or more xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (benzyloxyresorufin-O-dealkylase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, glutathione-S-transferases). The level of 2-methoxyacetic acid (MAA), a known testicular and developmental toxin, was significantly increased in the urine and plasma of animals treated with DMH but not in those administered the high dose BE, EHxE, or MHpE. ...",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 6.0 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibutyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibutyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hours. Direct photolysis is not expected to be an important removal process since aliphatic ethers do not absorb light in the environmental spectrum. If released to soil, dibutyl ether is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 51. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 6.0X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Dibutyl ether is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its extrapolated vapor pressure. Biodegradation of dibutyl ether in soil and water is expected to be a slow process, based upon its slow rate of biodegradation in aqueous screening studies conducted under aerobic conditions, and its lack of biodegradation in aquifer materials maintained under anaerobic conditions. If released into water, dibutyl ether is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on its estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to occur based on this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.6 days, respectively. BCFs ranging from 30 to 114 measured in fish suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dibutyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dibutyl ether is produced or used. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.5 hours and 4.6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), BCFs ranging from 30 to 114 measured in carp(6), suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Its use as a solvent in aerosol glues used to glue foam cushions has been especially problematic. 1-bromopropane\u2019s increasing use in the 21st century resulted from need for a substitute for chlorofluorocarbons and perchloroethylene (tetrachloroethylene).

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In this study, the factors influencing the disposition and biotransformation of 1-bromopropane (1-BrP) were examined in male F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice following inhalation exposure (800 ppm) or intravenous administration (5, 20, and 100 mg/kg). (1,2,3-(13)C)1-BrP and (1-(14)C)1-BrP were administered to enable characterization of urinary metabolites using NMR spectroscopy, LC-MS/MS, and HPLC coupled radiochromatography. Exhaled breath volatile organic chemicals (VOC), exhaled CO(2), urine, feces, and tissues were collected for up to 48 h post-administration for determination of radioactivity distribution. Rats and mice exhaled a majority of the administered dose as either VOC (40-72%) or (14)CO(2) (10-30%). For rats, but not mice, the percentage of the dose exhaled as VOC increased between the mid ( approximately 50%) and high ( approximately 71%) dose groups; while the percentage of the dose exhaled as (14)CO(2) decreased (19 to 10%). The molar ratio of exhaled (14)CO(2) to total released bromide, which decreased as dose increased, demonstrated that the proportion of 1-BrP metabolized via oxidation relative to pathways dependent on glutathione conjugation is inversely proportional to dose in the rat. ((14)C)1-BrP equivalents were recovered in urine (13-17%, rats; 14-23% mice), feces (<2%), or retained in the tissues and carcass (<6%) of rats and mice administered i.v. 5 to 100 mg/kg ((14)C)1-BrP. ... Rats pretreated with 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), a potent inhibitor of P450 excreted less in urine (down 30%), exhaled as (14)CO2 (down 80%), or retained in liver (down 90%), with a concomitant increase in radioactivity expired as VOC (up 52%). Following ABT pretreatment, rat urinary metabolites were reduced in number from 10 to 1, N-acetyl-S-propylcysteine, which accounted for >90% of the total urinary radioactivity in ABT pretreated rats. Together, these data demonstrate a role for cytochrome P450 and glutathione in the dose-dependent metabolism and disposition of 1-BrP in the rat.",

In this study, the factors influencing the disposition and biotransformation of 1-bromopropane (1-BrP) were examined in male F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice following inhalation exposure (800 ppm) or intravenous administration (5, 20, and 100 mg/kg). (1,2,3-(13)C)1-BrP and (1-(14)C)1-BrP were administered to enable characterization of urinary metabolites using NMR spectroscopy, LC-MS/MS, and HPLC coupled radiochromatography. ... Metabolites characterized in urine of rats and mice include N-acetyl-S-propylcysteine, N-acetyl-3-(propylsulfinyl)alanine, N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine, 1-bromo-2-hydroxypropane-O-glucuronide, N-acetyl-S-(2-oxopropyl)cysteine, and N-acetyl-3-[(2-oxopropyl)sulfinyl]alanine. These metabolites may be formed following oxidation of 1-bromopropane to 1-bromo-2-propanol and bromoacetone and following subsequent glutathione conjugation with either of these compounds. ...",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

These alkyl mercapturic acids are known or presumed biomarkers of exposure to several alkylating agents including methyl bromide, dimethyl sulfate, ethyl bromide, 1-bromopropane and 2-bromopropane. The method involves a column switching arrangement for online solid phase extraction of the analytes with subsequent analytical separation and detection using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Within day and day-to-day imprecision was determined to range from 4.5 to 12.2%. The analytical method is distinguished by its wide linear working range of up to 2,500 ug/L with detection limits ranging from 2.0 ug/L (for PrMA) to 5.1 ug/L (for MeMA) that render possible the application in various biomonitoring studies regarding exposure to alkylating agents. The results of a pilot study on urine samples of 30 individuals occupationally non-exposed to alkylating agents using the new procedure confirmed the background excretion of MeMA (<5.1-35.6 ug/L) and PrMA (<2.0-95.7 ug/L).",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

HUMAN STUDIES: Occupational exposure to 1-BP has been linked to neurological illnesses. Exposure to 1-BP could adversely affect peripheral nerves or/and the central nervous system. A 43-year-old male industrial worker developed muscle weakness, pain, numbness, and gait disturbance. Neurological examination indicated sensory ataxic neuropathy associated with mild impairment of upper motor neurons. He had used 1-BP as a cleaning agent for metal parts at his workplace without appropriate protection. Another case study reported that a 19-year-old male experienced weakness of the lower extremities and the right hand, numbness, and difficulty swallowing and urinating after 2 months of occupational exposure to a degreasing solvent based on 1-BP. 1-BP is cytotoxic but not corrosive, based on results from a cultured reconstructed human epidermal model (EpiDerm Skin Corrosivity Test). 1-BP can induce DNA damage in vitro in human leukocytes. ANIMAL STUDIES: 1-BP did not produce cutaneous reactions in guinea pigs attributable to skin sensitization. Inhalation exposure to 1-BP caused skin tumors in male rats, large intestine tumors in female and male rats, and lung tumors in female mice. Also noted was that 1-BP, either directly or via reactive metabolites, caused molecular alterations that typically are associated with carcinogenesis, including genotoxicity, oxidative stress, and glutathione depletion. It is unclear whether induction of immunotoxicity by 1-BP plays a role in tumor development. 1-BP caused immunosuppression in rodents. In particular, it reduced the numbers of T cells and T-cell subpopulations. In addition, there is evidence that 1-BP caused an inflammatory response. In rats, exposure to 1-BP did not affect memory function or motor coordination but muscle strength decreased dose-dependently. Dose-dependent increases in spontaneous locomotor activity and open-field behavior indicated that 1-BP has excitatory effects on the CNS of male rats. Rats exposed at 1000 and 1500 ppm 1-BP for 4 to 7 weeks exhibited decreases in body weight and motor nerve conduction velocities, increased distal latency of peripheral nerves, and neuronal dysfunction in the dentate gyrus of the brain. In two-generation study, 7-week-old rats were exposed 6 hours/day, 7 days/week for 70 days prior to mating at 0, 100, 250, 500, or 750 ppm 1-BP. Females were not exposed on postnatal day 0 to 4 and only they, not their litters, were exposed during postnatal days 5 to 21. F1 rats began direct exposure at weaning. Dose-related increases in estrous cycle length at >/=250 ppm, and follicular cysts and interstitial hyperplasia of ovaries at 500 ppm were observed in F0 and F1 females. Reduced fertility and litter size was observed in the F0 and F1 generations at >/=250 ppm. Prenatal 1-BP exposure in dams can cause delayed adverse effects on excitability of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of offspring. 1-BP was mutagenic with or without metabolic activation toward Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA1535 and TA100 when tested in a closed system, but it was not mutagenic toward strains TA1537, TA1538, or TA98. However in other studies, 1-BP was not mutagenic in either of two independent bacterial mutagenicity assays, each conducted with and without metabolic activation. Bacterial strains tested included Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA1535, and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA/pKM101. 1-BP was not mutagenic in vivo when tested in mice and rats.",

Consequently they can randomly modify the surfaces of proteins and lipids, leading to the disruption of enzyme, transporter or membrane functions.  Alkylation of DNA by alkylbromides may also lead to mutations. 1-bromopropane reacts quickly with hepatic glutathione (GSH) leading to its rapid depletion and subsequent liver damage. Long-term exposure to 1-bromopropane decreases neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus which may contribute to the neurotoxicity. Downregulation of brain derived neurotrophic factor and glucocoritoid receptor mRNA expression and low hippocampal norepinephrine levels might contribute, at least in part, to the reduced neurogenesis.",

Acute exposure may lead to coughing, shortness of breath, headache, nausea, vomiting. Chronic exposure can lead to damage of the blood, liver and CNS. Neurotoxicity can arise due to chronic exposure through inhalation or skin. Human cases of 1-bromopropane (1-BP) toxicity exhibit ataxic gait and cognitive dysfunction, whereas rat studies showed pyknotic shrinkage in cerebellar Purkinje cells and electrophysiological changes in the hippocampus. Inhalation exposure to 1-bromopropane causes skin tumors in male rats, large intestine tumors in female and male rats, and lung tumors in female mice. 1-bromopropane, either directly or via reactive metabolites, can cause molecular alterations that typically are associated with carcinogenesis, including genotoxicity, oxidative stress, and glutathione depletion. Hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity have been noted in rodent studies.\n\n",

Our previous studies showed that 1-BP impaired memory ability by compromising antioxidant cellular defenses. Melatonin is a powerful endogenous antioxidant, and the objective of this study was to explore the therapeutic role of melatonin in the treatment of 1-BP intoxication. Rats were intragastrically treated with 1-BP with or without melatonin, and then sacrificed on 27th day after 1-BP administration. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the spatial learning and memory ability of the experimental animals, and NeuN staining was performed to assess neuron loss in hippocampus. We found that rats treated with 1-BP spent more time and swam longer distance before landing on the hidden platform with a comparable swimming speed, which was markedly mitigated by the pretreatment with melatonin in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, 1-BP-induced notable decrease in neuron population in hippocampus by promoting apoptosis, and melatonin pretreatment attenuated those changes in brain. The GSH/GSSG ratio was proportionately decreased and heme oxygenase 1 was increased in the rats exposed to 1-BP, and administration of melatonin restored them. Meanwhile, MDA, the level of lipid peroxidation product, was significantly increased upon exposed to 1-BP, which was significantly attenuated by melatonin pretreatment, indicating that administration of 1-BP could interfere with redox homeostasis of brain in rat, and such 1-BP-induced biomedical changes were reversed by treatment with melatonin. We conclude that treatment with melatonin attenuates 1-BP-induced CNS toxicity through its ROS scavenging effect.",

To date, neurotoxicity of 1-BP has been induced in rats but not in mice due to the lethal hepatotoxicity of 1-BP. Oxidization by cytochromes P450 and conjugation with glutathione (GSH) are two critical metabolism pathways of 1-BP and play important roles in toxicity of 1-BP. The aim of the present study was to establish a murine model of 1-BP neurotoxicity, by reducing the hepatotoxicity of 1-BP with 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT); a commonly used nonspecific P450s inhibitor. The results showed that subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection of 1-ABT at 50 mg/kg body weight BID (100 mg/kg BW/day) for 3 days, inhibited about 92-96% of hepatic microsomal CYP2E1 activity, but only inhibited about 62-64% of CYP2E1 activity in brain microsomes. Mice treated with 1-ABT survived even after exposure to 1200 ppm 1-BP for 4 weeks and histopathological studies showed that treatment with 1-ABT protected mice from 1-BP-induced hepatic necrosis, hepatocyte degeneration, and hemorrhage. After 4-week exposure to 1-BP, the brain weight of 1-ABT(+)/1200ppm 1-BP group was decreased significantly. In 1-ABT-treated groups, expression of hippocampal Ran protein and cerebral cortical GRP78 was dose-dependently increased by exposure to 1-BP. We conclude that the control of hepatic P450 activity allows the observation of effects of 1-BP on the murine brain at a higher concentration by reduction of hepatotoxicity. The study suggests that further experiments with liver-specific control of P450 activity using gene technology might provide better murine models for 1-bromopropane-induced neurotoxicity.",

METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats (specific pathogen-free) were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 10 for each), i.e., solvent control group, 1-BP (800 mg/kg) group, NA (150 mg/kg) + 1-BP (800 mg/kg) group, and DHA (500 mg/kg) + 1-BP (800 mg/kg) group. The rats were given respective test substances by gavage for 7 d. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed from days 8 to 12 to evaluate the rats' learning and memory abilities. After MWM test, rats were sacrificed in the next day, and cerebral cortex was quickly dissected and homogenized in an ice bath. The supernatant of the obtained homogenate was collected to measure the content of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of glutathione reductase (GR) and gamma-glutamate cysteine ligase (gamma-GCL).  RESULTS: The MWM spatial navigation test showed that the 1-BP group had significantly longer escape latency and significantly longer total swimming distance compared with the control group (P<0.05), while the DHA+1-BP group had significant decreases in escape latency and total swimming distance compared with the 1-BP group (P<0.05). The spatial probe test showed that the number of platform crossings was significantly greater in the DHA+1-BP group and NA+1-BP group than in the 1-BP group (P<0.05); compared with the control group, the 1-BP group had a significantly lower ratio of time spent in the zone around the platform to total time (P < 0.05), and the ratio was significantly higher in the DHA+1-BP group than in the 1-BP group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the 1-BP group had a 18.1% decrease in GSH content, and DHA could significantly reverse 1-BP-induced decrease in GSH content (P < 0.05). Compared with the 1-BP group, the DHA+1-BP group and NA+1-BP group had significantly decreased MDA content (P < 0.05), the DHA+1-BP group had significantly increased GR activity (P < 0.05), and the NA+1-BP group had significantly increased gamma-GCL activity (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: The rats exposed to 1-BP have oxidative stress in the brain and impaired cognitive function. DHA and NA can reduce 1-BP-induced cognitive function impairment in rats, possibly by increasing the activities of GR and gamma-GCL and the content of GSH in the brain.",

Herein, /the authors/ report a new case of 1-bromopropane-induced neurotoxicity. A 43-year-old male industrial worker developed muscle weakness, pain, numbness, and gait disturbance. Neurological examination indicated sensory ataxic neuropathy associated with mild impairment of upper motor neurons. He had used 1-bromopropane as a cleaning agent for metal parts at his workplace without appropriate protection. The serum bromide level was elevated at the onset of clinical manifestations. Histopathologic examination of sural nerve biopsy showed axonal damage. Under the tentative diagnosis of 1-bromopropane toxicity, he was kept away from exposure to the solvent. This resulted in gradual improvement of symptoms, recovery of motor function, and resolution of sensory deficits. The diagnosis of 1-bromopropane neurotoxicity in this case was based on details of the work environment, the clinical course, and laboratory and pathologic findings. ...",

Survival of 500 ppm males was significantly less than that of the chamber control group. Mean body weights of exposed groups were similar to those of the chamber controls. Increased incidences of macroscopic, soft, pale-yellow to green, variably sized nodules were seen predominantly in the nose and skin of exposed rats. The number of animals with multiple masses was increased in the 500 ppm groups.

The incidences of pancreatic islet adenoma in all exposed groups of males and of pancreatic islet adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 125 and 250 ppm males were significantly increased. Treatment-related nonneoplastic lesions were observed in the respiratory system of exposed male and female rats. In the nose, the incidences of suppurative chronic inflammation, chronic active inflammation, glandular hyperplasia, respiratory epithelial hyperplasia (females), and respiratory metaplasia of the olfactory epithelium (females) were increased in all exposed groups. In the larynx, the incidences of chronic active inflammation and squamous metaplasia (except 125 ppm females) were increased in all exposed groups, and the incidences of suppurative chronic inflammation were increased in the 500 ppm groups. Also, chronic inflammation of the lung was observed in the 500 ppm females. In the trachea, there were increased incidences of chronic active inflammation in all exposed groups of females and 500 ppm males, and the incidence of epithelial hyperplasia was increased in 500 ppm females.",

Mean body weights of 1,000 ppm males were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. The increases in sorbitol dehydrogenase activities in 500 ppm males and 1,000 ppm males and females were consistent with the histopathologic evidence of mild hepatotoxicity caused by 1-bromopropane. Liver weights of males exposed to 250 ppm or greater and of females exposed to 125 ppm or greater were significantly increased. Spleen and kidney weights of 1,000 ppm females were significantly increased. Exposure concentration-related decreases of 28% in sperm motility and 37% in sperm counts were seen in the 1,000 ppm group of male rats. Female rats in all three exposure groups evaluated exhibited altered estrous cycles, spending significantly more time in extended estrus and less time in extended diestrus. The incidences of cytoplasmic vacuolization of the liver were significantly increased in males exposed to 250 ppm or greater and in females exposed to 500 ppm or greater.

Its use in vapor and immersion degreasing operations for cleaning metals, plastics and electronic and optical components and use in dry cleaning and former use in aerosol solvents will result in its direct release to the environment. 1-Bromopropane is also produced naturally by at least 6 species of marine macroalgae and may be transported from the algae to the surrounding environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 111 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates that 1-bromopropane will exist solely in the vapor-phase in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-bromopropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 days. 1-Bromopropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-bromopropane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 37. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.3X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Bromopropane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 70% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil or water. A number of pure culture studies have shown that various microorganisms are capable of degrading 1-bromopropane. If released into water, 1-bromopropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.4 hours and 4.4 days, respectively. The hydrolysis half-life of 1-bromopropane is about 26 days at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C. An estimated BCF of 11 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1-bromopropane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-bromopropane is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-bromopropane via inhalation of ambient air at locations where 1-bromopropane is used as dry cleaning agent, degreaser or solvent.

Vapor-phase 1-bromopropane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 15 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.06X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). 1-Bromopropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Both Pseudomonas strains ES-1 and ES-2 were isolated from organobromide-rich industrial wastewater using 1-bromooctane as the only carbon source(2). Pseudomonas strain ES-2 aerobically debrominates 1-bromopropane but cannot utilize this compound for growth(1,2). Pseudomonas strain ES-1 was unable to grow or to debrominate 1-bromopropane when this compound was present as the sole carbon source(2). Acinetobacter strain GJ70, isolated from activated sludge, was able to utilize 1-bromopropane as a carbon source with a generation time of 7.4 hours. 1-Bromopropane, added to the culture medium at 2 mM concentration, was completely dehalogenated aerobically within six days with the production of 2.2 mM of the halide(3). A crude cell extract of this bacterial strain gave products of 1-propanol and bromide from 1-bromopropane; as no aldehydes were produced or oxygen consumed during this reaction, it was suggested that the mechanism for this reaction was hydrolytic dehalogenation(3). These pure culture studies suggest that 1-bromopropane may biodegrade under environmental conditions(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is likely that workers were exposed to 1-bromopropane through inhalation and dermal contact(1). One survey, where 1-bromopropane was used as a solvent with a glue spray gun, showed that the daily time weighted average (TWA) air concentrations ranged from 60 to 261 ppm(1); another study, where workers cleaned and painted metal surfaces with preparations containing 1-bromopropane and other solvents, showed a geometric mean exposure of 1.42 ppm with a maximal exposure of 27.8 ppm(1). In a recent New Jersey monitoring study of 1-bromopropane in the dry cleaning industry, the highest exposure measured was a dry cleaning machine operator where exposure was 54 ppm as an 8-hr time-weighted average(2); personal breathing zone exposures ranged from 0.24 to 54.55 ppm as 8-hr time-weighted averages for clerks and operators(2).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

It does not have a commercial use, other than in biochemical research of PAH. HUMAN STUDIES: Benzo(a)fluorene is present as a minor component of the total content of polynuclear aromatic compounds in the environment. Human exposure to benzo(a)fluorene occurs primarily through the smoking of tobacco, inhalation of polluted air and by ingestion of food and water contaminated with combustion products. ANIMAL STUDIES: Benzo(a)fluorene was tested for carcinogenicity in mice in one study by skin application and in a mouse-skin initiation-promotion assay. Negative results were obtained in both studies. In a study involving subcutaneous administration of benzo(a)fluorene to mice, no injection-site tumor was observed. The available data were inadequate to evaluate the mutagenicity of benzo(a)fluorene to Salmonella typhimurium. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Benzo(a)fluorene is a known aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist.",

Studies have noted that lung tumor induction does not correlate with the benzo[a]pyrene content of coal tar, suggesting that other hydrocarbons may be involved in the observed tumorigenicity. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a major 'unknown' chemical-DNA adduct is formed in the lung of mice exposed to coal tar. We have used an in vitro rat microsomal activation system to generate the 'unknown' adduct with neat coal tar and fractions of coal tar obtained by chemical fractionation and HPLC. Chemical-DNA adduct formation was evaluated by (32)P-postlabeling using both multi-dimensional TLC and HPLC. GC-MS analysis of the coal tar fractions obtained from HPLC, which produced the 'unknown' adduct in vitro, demonstrated that the adducting hydrocarbon had a mass of 216. A careful evaluation of candidate hydrocarbons led to the conclusion that a benzofluorene derivative may be responsible for forming the 'unknown' chemical-DNA adduct. Comparative in vitro and in vivo studies on the adducting properties of all three isomers of benzofluorene indicated that 7H-benzo[c]fluorene is responsible for producing the 'unknown' adduct observed in the lung of mice ingesting coal tar. Animal feeding studies also demonstrated that 7H-benzo[c]fluorene formed considerably more lung DNA adducts than 11H-benzo[a]fluorene and 11H-benzo[b]fluorene. These data indicate that the four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 7H-benzo[c]fluorene, a hydrocarbon not previously shown to form DNA adducts in lung, is in fact a potent lung DNA adductor and is a candidate PAH for causing lung tumors in animals treated with coal tar.",

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to the porewater displayed acute developmental toxicity and cardiac teratogenesis, presumably because of elevated sediment levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from historical creosote use. Pretreatment of porewater with several physical and chemical particle removal methods revealed that colloid-bound chemicals constituted the bulk of the observed toxicity. Size-exclusive chromatography and normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography were used to fractionate Elizabeth River porewater. Acute toxicity of porewater extracts and extract fractions was assessed as the pericardial area in embryonic zebrafish. The most toxic fraction contained several known aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists (e.g., 1,2-benzofluorene and 1,2-benzanthracene) and cytochrome P450 A1 (CPY1A) inhibitors (e.g., dibenzothiophene and fluoranthene). The second most toxic fraction contained known AhR agonists (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene). Addition of a CYP1A inhibitor, fluoranthene, increased toxicity in all active porewater fractions, suggesting synergism between several contaminants present in porewaters. The results indicate that the observed acute toxicity associated with Elizabeth River porewater results from high concentrations of AhR agonistic PAHs and mixture effects related to interactions between compounds co-occurring at the Elizabeth River site. However, even after extensive fractionation and chemical characterization, it remains plausible that some active compounds in Elizabeth River porewater remain unidentified.",

It has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke, sidestream cigarette smoke, cigarette smoke-polluted rooms, smoke of marijuana cigarettes and gasoline engine exhaust. Benzo(a)fluorene is emitted in smoke from burning wood, plastics and coal. It occurs in fossil fuels and crude oils. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.43X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates  benzo(a)fluorene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzo(a)fluorene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.3 hours. Particulate-phase benzo(a)fluoranthene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(a)fluorene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(a)fluorene is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2.88X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole and strong adsorption to soil. Benzo(a)fluorene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with 4 or more rings, such as benzo(a)fluorene, are generally resistant to biodegradation. If released into water, benzo(a)fluoranthene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 35 and 260 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 2600 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, benzo(a)fluorene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzo(a)fluorene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(a)fluorene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of organic fuels. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(a)fluorene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as benzo(a)fluorene, with more than 3 rings appear to be extremely stable to biodegradation(5). Breakdown in soil generally takes weeks to months for PAHs with 3 rings, primarily by action of microorganisms; PAHs with 4 or more rings are generally resistant to biodegradation(6,7).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.5X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 2.43X10-7 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 0.045 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 35 and 260 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column.  The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 2600(SRC), from a log Kow of 5.68(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, benzo(a)fluorene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(10). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with four or more rings, such as benzo(a)fluorene, are generally expected to be resistant to biodegradation(11,12). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). Benzo(a)fluorene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(13), and therefore is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis at water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Ambient air monitoring has detected benzo(a)fluorene in both the vapor and particulate phases(3). Vapor-phase benzo(a)fluorene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase benzo(a)fluorene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC).  Benzo(a)fluorene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that benzo(a)fluorene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 35 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 260 days(SRC).  However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column.  The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is >10 years if adsorption is considered (4). Air-water interface monitoring conducted in the Chesapeake Bay during 1996-1997 indicated that volatilization of benzo(a)fluorene can occur(5). Benzo(a)fluorene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to occur(SRC). Benzo(a)fluorene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

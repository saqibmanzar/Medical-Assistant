It is currently FDA approved for its use as an indirect additive used in food contact substances. Propiolactone was first commercially available in the United States in 1958.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Manifestation of such mechanism is the null fertility after meiosis of diploid mutants induced by 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine.",

The rate of alkylation by lactones was guanosine greater than RNA= denatured DNA greater than double-stranded DNA. The type of the adducts formed were characterized by fluorescence and ultraviolet spectroscopy. Similar alkylation products were formed by the two lactones. The main sites alkylated were N-1 at adenosine, N-3 at cytidine and N-7 at guanosine. The results suggest that the carcinogenic potency of the lactones correlates with their reactivity rather than with specificity of the adducts formed.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

When administered as a series of nontoxic exposures, UV-A alone was found to induce cellular transformation as a linear function of the numbers of UV-A exposures. Possible interactions of UV-A with environmentally encountered chemical carcinogens were studied by examining the effects of UV-A light exposures on cellular transformation in cells exposed to the direct acting carcinogen, beta-propiolactone, an alkylating agent, with a standard initiation/promotion protocol. Twenty-four hours after a single treatment with 2.5 ug/ml of beta-propiolactone, cells were exposed to 3.0 kJ/sq m of UV-A light. UV-A exposures were repeated weekly for up to 5 weeks, after which cells were fixed, stained and dishes were scored for type III transformed foci. Weekly exposures to UV-A alone for 5 weeks induced approximately 3 foci/dish. Treatment with beta-propiolactone alone induced approximately 1 focus/dish (background was 0.17 foci/dish). A combination of the two treatments resulted in a marked increase in the yield of transformed foci/dish, with the UV-A enhancement increasing with increasing numbers of exposures (approximately 10 foci/dish after a single exposure to beta-propiolactone and five UV-A exposures). These results suggest a synergistic interaction between beta-propiolactone and subsequent UV-A exposures in the induction of in vitro neoplastic transformation.",

Sodium 4-mercaptobenzene sulfonate is a potent nucleophile and was found to react rapidly in vitro with the direct-acting carcinogen beta-propiolactone. In further investigations sodium 4-mercaptobenzene sulfonate was shown to inhibit mutagenesis resulting from exposure of Salmonella typhimurium strain TA-100 to beta-propiolactone and a second direct-acting carcinogen, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoquanidine. Subsequent experiments were performed to determine if sodium 4-mercaptobenzene sulfonate would inhibit beta-propiolactone induced carcinogenesis in vivo. In the first of these, sodium 4-mercaptobenzene sulfonate was administered by oral intubation to female A/J mice 5 min before oral administration of beta-propiolactone. Under these conditions inhibitions of carcinogenesis of the forestomach occurred. In a second experiment, sodium 4-mercaptobenzene sulfonate was given by rectal intubation 5 min before beta-propiolactone also administered intrarectally. Administration of beta-propiolactone intrarectally produced adenomatous polyps of the large intestine. The occurrence of these neoplasms was inhibited by the prior administration of sodium 4-mercaptobenzene sulfonate. These results suggest that sodium 4-mercaptobenzene sulfonate has the capacity to trap direct-acting carcinogens and to inhibit the occurrence of beta-propiolactone induced neoplasia.",

The tumor incidence for the group receiving fluocinolone acetonide prior to beta-propiolactone was significantly greater than for beta-propiolactone alone (p< 0.0005).

Sodium thiosulfate is a potent nucleophile and in initial experiments was found to inhibit mutagenesis resulting from exposure of Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 to the direct-acting carcinogens beta-propiolactone and styrene oxide. In in vitro experiments sodium thiosulfate was shown to maintain its nucleophilicity in the acid pH range. It reacted with beta-propiolactone as rapidly at pH 2 as at pH 7.4. Thus sodium thiosulfate has the prerequisite attributes to inhibit the carcinogenic effects of electrophiles in the stomach. Experiments were performed in which sodium thiosulfate was administered by oral intubation to female A/J mice 5 min before oral administration of beta-propiolactone. Under these conditions, inhibition of formation of the forestomach tumors occurred. The data obtained suggest that use of nucleophiles to protect against direct-acting carcinogens is a potential strategy for chemoprevention.",

If released to soil, relatively rapid hydrolysis can be expected to occur in the presence of moisture. Significant evaporation may occur from dry surfaces. If released to the atmosphere, beta-propiolactone is expected to exist in the gas-phase where it may be relatively persistent. The half-life for the reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals can be estimated to occur at the relatively slow rate of 45 days in the atmosphere. Physical removal from air via wet deposition may be possible since beta-propiolactone is very water soluble. Occupational exposure may be possible through inhalation and dermal contact at sites where beta-propiolactone is used as a chemical intermediate. (SRC)",

Beta-propiolactone is very water soluble (37 % v/v at 25 \u00b0C)(1), therefore, physical removal from air by wet deposition processes such as rainfall may be possible(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

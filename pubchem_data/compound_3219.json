Emedastine reversibly and competitively blocks histamine by binding to H1 receptors, thus blocking its downstream activity. As a result this agent interferes with mediator release from mast cells either by inhibiting calcium ion influx across mast cell/basophil plasma membrane or by inhibiting intracellular calcium ion release within the cells. In addition, emedastine may also inhibit the late-phase allergic reaction mediated through leukotrienes or prostaglandins, or by producing an anti-platelet activating factor effect. Upon ocular administration, emedastine causes a dose-dependent inhibition of histamine-stimulated vascular permeability in the conjunctiva. Emedastine does not affect adrenergic, dopamine, or serotonin receptors.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

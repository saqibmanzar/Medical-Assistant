When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

After drying, milling and fractionation, yellowish lactose (edible grade) of different particle sizes is obtained. After the washing stage the raw product can be redissolved, treated with activated carbon and recrystallized to refined or pharmaceutical grades of lactose.

The products were said to be similar in taste and consistency. Doses of lactose fed (with a light breakfast) were 1.6 grams (250 mL, lactose- reduced milk), 3.2 grams (500 mL, lactose reduced milk), 11.3 grams (250 mL milk), 22.5 grams (500 mL milk), and 50 grams (lactose tolerance test). The respective median symptom scores for these lactose loads were 0.3, 0.2, 0.5, 1.1, and 6.1, with a maximal score of 12. No significant increase in symptoms was noted between conventional and low lactose milk at the 250 mL dosage, while a significant increase was noted with the 500 mL dosage, although symptoms tended to be slight (score 1.1 out of 12). When the lactose dosage was increased to 50 grams (1,000 mL of milk), symptoms became appreciable (score 6.1 out of 12), although there was no control for this phase of the study. This study demonstrates that 11.3 grams of lactose was tolerated, 22.5 grams yielded mild symptoms, and 50 grams was clearly intolerable.",

The study was carried out with 18 Wistar rats divided in three groups receiving distilled water, lactose or chitosan. A solution of each excipient was administered by inhalation at a dose of 20 mg. The lungs were excised and processed to determine several biochemical parameters used as toxicity biomarkers. Protein and carbonyl group content, lipid peroxidation, reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), myeloperoxidase (MPO), cooper/zinc and manganese superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione peroxidase were determined. Results of myeloperoxidase activity and glutathione disulfide lung concentrations showed a relevant decrease for chitosan group compared to control: 4.67 +/- 2.27 versus 15.10 +/- 7.27 (P = 0.011) for MPO and 0.89 +/- 0.68 versus 2.02 +/- 0.22 (P = 0.014) for GSSG. The other parameters did not vary significantly among groups. Lactose and chitosan administered by inhalation failed to show toxic effects to the pulmonary tissue. A protective effect against oxidative stress might even be attributed to chitosan, since some biomarkers had values significantly lower than those observed in the control group when this product was inhaled. Nevertheless, caution must be taken regarding chemical composition and technological processes applied to incorporate these products during drug formulation, in particular for dry powder inhalators.",

Adult controls had larger ceca than weanlings, but the numbers of bacteria were not significantly different. Expressed in relation to body weight, cecal microbial enzyme activities were significantly lower in adult controls, with the exceptions of beta-glucuronidase and urease. Lactose caused cecal enlargement; this was greatest in weanling animals, which also showed a decreased concentration of bacteria. Lactose increased total nitrate reductase and urease activities in both age groups, but decreased total azoreductase and nitroreductase activities in weanlings. Enzyme activities per 1x10+9 bacteria were decreased for azoreductase, beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and nitroreductase in both age groups, while urease activity increased. Azoreductase and nitroreductase activities were highly correlated but nitrate reductase and urease did not correlate significantly with any other enzyme activity.",

Seventy-five Long-Evans female rats (25-day-old) were randomized to receive one of 3 diets for 7 months: glucose diet (CON); low lactose diet (10.5%, LLD); or a high lactose diet (41.9%, HLD). Necropsy was performed seven months after randomization. HLD animals had significantly lower body weights than controls (P < 0.01). These animals continued to grow, however at a retarded rate compared to the CON group. The HLD group also had significantly lower triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid levels than the CON group (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). Serum glucose concentrations were lower in the HLD group compared to CON animals (P < 0.05), while serum insulin levels were lower than both the LLD and CON animals (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). Leptin exhibited a similar trend. Thyroid studies revealed no difference in /thyroid-stimulating hormone/ between groups. Free /thyroxine/ was significantly higher in HLD rats compared to LLD and CON rats while free /triiodothyronine/ was lower in the HLD group (P < 0.05). This indicates a possible impairment in /thyroxine/ to /triiodothyronine/ conversion. ... data suggests that a long-term high lactose diet is associated with a decrease in insulin and leptin levels, and an increase in the insulin to glucose ratio. However, these changes are seen in the presence of a decreased body mass. A significant effect on thyroid hormone metabolism is also seen, and may be an adaptive mechanism in lactose-fed rats.",

This relationship is hypothesized to be based on altered Ca(2+) homeostasis due to increased intestinal Ca(2+) absorption. Other agents associated with pheochromocytomas in rats in long-term toxicity studies have been shown to increase chromaffin cell proliferation, leading to the suggestion that the tumors occur secondarily to increased chromaffin cell turnover. We have demonstrated marked stimulation of chromaffin cell proliferation by vitamin D3, a potent stimulus to Ca(2+) absorption not previously associated with adrenal medullary toxicity. This effect is detectable during the first week of dietary supplementation and persists throughout a 4-week time course. Lactose and xylitol, representative of sugars and sugar alcohols associated with pheochromocytomas, are also mitogenic but to a lesser extent, with their effects first detectable during Week 4 of dietary supplementation. Vitamin D 3, its active metabolite calcitriol, lactose, and xylitol all fail to stimulate proliferation of rat chromaffin cellsin vitro.The mitogenic effects of these agents may be mediated presynaptically in vivo.The data suggest that altered Ca (2+) homeostasis may increase chromaffin cell proliferation and support the hypothesis that diets containing high concentrations of sugars and sugar alcohols cause pheochromocytomas in rats secondarily by this mechanism.",

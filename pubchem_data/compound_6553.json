When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The following four metabolites were identified in the liver at 12 h after treatment with 1,2-DBP, by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS): M1, 2-hydroxypropylglutathione; M2, 2-oxopropylglutathione; M3, N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxypropyl)-L-cysteine; and M4, N-acetyl-S-(2-oxopropyl)-L-cysteine. Ions of individual conjugates were observed at m/z 366, 364, 222 and 220, respectively. Characteristic product ions at m/z 237, 217, 204 and 202 for the identification of M1, M2, M3 and M4 were observed, respectively. In the sera isolated from the same animals, only mercapturic acids (M3 and M4) were observed by LC-ESI/MS. When female BALB/c mice were treated orally with 1,2-DBP at doses of 150, 300 and 600 mg kg(-1) once for 12 h, the production of glutathione conjugates and mercapturic acids in liver was apparently dose dependent, as were the concentrations of them in sera. When the production of metabolites from 1,2-DBP was investigated in liver following oral treatment with 600 mg kg(-1) 1,2-DBP for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, metabolite concentrations were greatest at the first time point (6 h).",

Mercapturic acid IV was a minor metabolite which could only be measured at doses of 200 mg/kg or higher. In 24 hr, urinary excretion of mercapturic acids amounted to about 36% of the dose (11% I, 21% II, 4% III, 0.2% IV). No dose dependency was found up to the highest dose.",

Four days before necropsy, the mice were immunized intraperitoneally with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). 1,2-DBP reduced the weights of the spleen and thymus and decreased the number of splenic cells. In addition, treatment with 1,2-DBP suppressed the antibody response to SRBCs. The time course effects of 2-BP and 1,2-DBP on the hepatotoxic parameters were compared in female BALB/c mice. When mice were treated orally with either one of these chemicals for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h, the activities of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase elevated significantly only with 1,2-DBP 24 h after the treatment.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 7.84 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2-dibromopropane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2-dibromopropane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 37 days. 1,2-Dibromopropane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,2-dibromopropane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.46X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. 1,2-Dibromopropane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data are not available for 1,2-dibromopropane. If released into water, 1,2-dibromopropane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Using hydrolysis rates measured at elevated temperatures, a hydrolysis half-life of 320 days (rate constant = 2.5X10-8 per second) at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7 was calculated for 1,2-dibromopropane. Occupational exposure to 1,2-dibromopropane is expected to be limited to laboratory researchers who use this chemical. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.46X10-3 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure, 7.84 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 1.43X10+3 mg/L(3). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 10(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Using hydrolysis rates measured at elevated temperatures, a hydrolysis half-life of 320 days (rate constant = 2.5X10-8 per second) at 25 \u00b0C and pH 7 was calculated for 1,2-dibromopropane(7,8).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1,2-dibromopropane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 6 days(SRC). 1,2-Dibromopropane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 1,2-dibromopropane from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon the vapor pressure(1).",

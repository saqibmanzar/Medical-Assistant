It can be produced from the reduction of palmitic acid. Cetyl alcohol is present in a waxy white powder or flake form at room temperature, and is insoluble in water and soluble in alcohols and oils. Discovered by Chevrenl in 1913, cetyl alcohol is one of the oldest known long-chain alcohol. It may be contained in cosmetic and personal care products such as shampoos, creams and lotions. Mainly it is used as an opacifier, emulsifier, and thickening agent that alter the thickness of the liquid, and increase and stabilize the foaming capacity. Due to its water-binding property, cetyl alcohol is commonly used as an emollient that prevents drying and chapping of the skin. According to the FDA Code of Federal Regulations, cetyl alcohol is a safe synthetic fatty acid in food and in the synthesis of food components under the condition that it contain not less than 98 percent of total alcohols and not less than 94 percent of straight chain alcohols. Cetyl alcohol is also listed in the OTC ingredient list as a skin protectant for skin irritations caused by poison ivy, oak, sumac, and insect bites or stings. Cetyl alcohol is reported to be a mild skin or eye irritant.",

With the demise of commercial whaling, cetyl alcohol is no longer primarily produced from whale oil, but instead either as an end-product of the petroleum industry, or produced from vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. Production of cetyl alcohol from palm oil gives rise to one of its alternative names, palmityl alcohol.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The extent to which as alcohol undergoes the second reaction, i.e. direct conjugation to an ether glucuronide, appears to depend upon the speed of the first reaction, for alcohols which are rapidly oxidized from very little ether glucuronide unless given in high doses.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

A theoretical BOD of 0% was observed using the AFNOR (the French norm procedure) screening test and a 5-day incubation period(2). In standard 5-day BOD tests using emulsified 1-hexadecanol, 30-60% of initial 1-hexadecanol was oxidized(3). In studies designed to examine the biodegradability of 1-hexadecanol in thin films (monolayer) on water surfaces, it was found that biological destruction of the monolayer resulted in measurable consumption of the material with all substrates that were tested; substrates included 2% settled domestic sewage in BOD dilution water, 50% Ohio River water + 50% BOD dilution water, water from a stock pond near San Antonio, TX, and other combinations of BOD dilution water and mineral supplements; oxidation rates varied with substrates; oxidation rates varied from 6.2 to 14.3% over incubation periods of 20 to 48 days(3). In Warburg respirometer tests using activated sludge and 500 mg/L of 1-hexadecanol (well above its aqueous solubility), the theoretical oxygen demand was only 0.4% after a 12-hr incubation period(4). In static culture tests examining the disappearance of 1-hexadecanol in seeded media as compared to unseeded control media over a 10-day incubation period, almost none disappeared from the control media while nearly 20% disappeared from the seeded media; in shake flask tests using seeded media and a fine granular form of 1-hexadecanol, the initial 1-hexadecanol concn of 100 mg/L decreased to only 0.25 mg/L after 30 days of incubation; the overall results of the study concluded that given sufficient time in contact with adapted microbial species under conditions otherwise non-limiting, the complete disappearance of 1-hexadecanol as an identifiable molecular species will occur; one limiting condition is the relative insolubility of 1-hexadecanol in water; it was found that microbial growth occurs more rapidly when the 1-hexadecanol substrate is added in dissolved form (eg hexane solution)(5).",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern. Cetyl alcohol is found on List D.

Its use to retard evaporation of water from reservoirs and growing plants will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-hexadecanol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-hexadecanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Particulate-phase 1-hexadecanol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, 1-hexadecanol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 25,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Various biological screening studies have demonstrated that 1-hexadecanol biodegrades both aerobically and anaerobically. If released into water, 1-hexadecanol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 23 hours and 12 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.8 years if adsorption is considered. An observed BCF of 56 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-hexadecanol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-hexadecanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-hexadecanol via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing 1-hexadecanol.

A theoretical BOD of 0% was observed using the AFNOR (the French norm procedure) screening test and a 5-day incubation period(2). In standard 5-day BOD tests using emulsified 1-hexadecanol, 30-60% of initial 1-hexadecanol was oxidized(3). In studies designed to examine the biodegradability of 1-hexadecanol in thin films (monolayer) on water surfaces, it was found that biological destruction of the monolayer resulted in measurable consumption of the material with all substrates that were tested; substrates included 2% settled domestic sewage in BOD dilution water, 50% Ohio River water + 50% BOD dilution water, water from a stock pond near San Antonio, TX, and other combinations of BOD dilution water and mineral supplements; oxidation rates varied with substrates; oxidation rates varied from 6.2 to 14.3% over incubation periods of 20 to 48 days(3). In Warburg respirometer tests using activated sludge and 500 mg/L of 1-hexadecanol (well above its aqueous solubility), the theoretical oxygen demand was only 0.4% after a 12-hr incubation period(4). In static culture tests examining the disappearance of 1-hexadecanol in seeded media as compared to unseeded control media over a 10-day incubation period, almost none disappeared from the control media while nearly 20% disappeared from the seeded media; in shake flask tests using seeded media and a fine granular form of 1-hexadecanol, the initial 1-hexadecanol concn of 100 mg/L decreased to only 0.25 mg/L after 30 days of incubation; the overall results of the study concluded that given sufficient time in contact with adapted microbial species under conditions otherwise non-limiting, the complete disappearance of 1-hexadecanol as an identifiable molecular species will occur; one limiting condition is the relative insolubility of 1-hexadecanol in water; it was found that microbial growth occurs more rapidly when the 1-hexadecanol substrate is added in dissolved form (eg hexane solution)(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 1-hexadecanol is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 23 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 12 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.8 years if adsorption is considered (4). 1-Hexadecanol's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 1-Hexadecanol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

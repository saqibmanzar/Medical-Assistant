ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The current treatments for OA pain such as NSAIDS or opiates are neither sufficiently effective nor devoid of detrimental side effects. Animal models of OA are being developed to improve our understanding of OA-related pain mechanisms and define novel pharmacological targets for therapy. Currently available models of OA in rodents include surgical and chemical interventions into one knee joint. The monoiodoacetate (MIA) model has become a standard for modelling joint disruption in OA in both rats and mice. The model, which is easier to perform in the rat, involves injection of MIA into a knee joint that induces rapid pain-like responses in the ipsilateral limb, the level of which can be controlled by injection of different doses. Intra-articular injection of MIA disrupts chondrocyte glycolysis by inhibiting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatase dehydrogenase and results in chondrocyte death, neovascularization, subchondral bone necrosis and collapse, as well as inflammation. The morphological changes of the articular cartilage and bone disruption are reflective of some aspects of patient pathology. Along with joint damage, MIA injection induces referred mechanical sensitivity in the ipsilateral hind paw and weight bearing deficits that are measurable and quantifiable. These behavioral changes resemble some of the symptoms reported by the patient population, thereby validating the MIA injection in the knee as a useful and relevant pre-clinical model of OA pain. The aim of this article is to describe the methodology of intra-articular injections of MIA and the behavioral recordings of the associated development of hypersensitivity with a mind to highlight the necessary steps to give consistent and reliable recordings.",

A Doehlert experimental design was performed to determine the optimum conditions for the five most significant factors in the derivatization step: namely, the volume and concentration of acidic methanol (optimized values = 15%, 1 mL), the volume and concentration of Na2SO4 solution (129 g/L, 8.5 mL), and the volume of saturated NaHCO3 solution (1 mL). Also, derivatization time and temperature were optimized by a two-variable Doehlert design, resulting in the following optimized parameters: an extraction time of 11 minutes for IF and THM4 and 14 minutes for IAA and HAA9; mass of anhydrous Na2SO4 of 4 g for IF and THM4 and 16 g for IAA and HAA9; derivatization time of 160 min and temperature at 40 \u00b0C. Under optimal conditions, the optimized procedure achieves excellent linearity (R(2) ranges 0.9990-0.9998), low detection limits (0.0008-0.2 ug/L), low quantification limits (0.008-0.4 ug/L), and good recovery (86.6%-106.3%). Intra- and inter-day precision were less than 8.9% and 8.8%, respectively. The method was validated by applying it to the analysis of raw, flocculated, settled, and finished waters collected from a water treatment plant in China.",

HUMAN STUDIES: Iodoacetic acid is toxic to essentially all parts of the eye, when either applied directly or administered systemically. Iodoacetate has been shown to be toxic to the cornea, iris, lens, ciliary body, and retina. Iodoacetic acid did not increase significantly the frequency of micronucleus in binucleated TK6 cells. Stable chromosome aberrations (translocations) were induced in human cells by sodium iodoacetate. ANIMAL STUDIES: Iodoacetate injected intravenously in rabbits or cats causes almost immediate drop in the  electric action potentials of the retina, owing to injury of the visual cells. It also causes proteins and cells to appear in the aqueous humor and induces cellular exudation into the vitreous body in five days. Histologic changes are observable in the corneal endothelium and ciliary epithelium. When applied to eyes from which the corneal epithelium has been removed, or when injected into the corneal stroma, solutions from 0.001 M to 0.1 M cause severe to devastating injury. Addition of iodoacetate to the aqueous humor causes corneal edema. Injection into the anterior chamber caused severe damage to the cornea and iris as well as cataract. Excised or isolated rabbit retina has been shown by several investigators to be directly poisoned by iodoacetate, abolishing the ERG and causing selective destruction of rod cells at low concentrations. Iodoacetate is selectively more injurious to rods than cones. The intra-articular injection of iodoacetate into the knee joint of rats produced changes in the articular cartilage which resembled those of osteoarthritis. Iodoacetic acid transformed NIH3T3 cells in a cell-transformation assay that resulted in aggressive fibrosarcomas after injection into mice. Iodoacetic acid was significantly genotoxic to S. typhimurium.",

In this article, we report the results obtained in the evaluation of the chromosome damage induced by three monohaloacetic acids, namely iodoacetic acid (IAA), bromoacetic acid (BAA) and chloroacetic acid (CAA). To evaluate the induction of chromosome damage, we used the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test that measures the ability of genotoxic agents to induce both clastogenic and/or aneugenic effects. ... We tested five doses of each HAA, in addition to the negative and positive controls. The highest dose tested for each HAA was that immediately lower than the dose producing total cytotoxicity. Our results show that none of the three HAAs tested was able to increase significantly the frequency of micronucleus in binucleated TK6 cells, the rank order in decreasing cytotoxicity was IAA > BAA >> CAA.",

Although increased cancer incidence has been associated with exposure to this complex mixture, the carcinogenic potential of individual DBPs remains not well known; thus, further studies are required. Haloacetic acids (HAAs) constitute an important group among DBPs. In this study, we have assessed the in vitro carcinogenic potential of three HAAs namely chloro-, bromo-, and iodoacetic acids. Using a long-term (8 weeks) and sub-toxic doses exposure scenario, different in vitro transformation markers were evaluated using a human urothelial cell line (T24). Our results indicate that long-term exposure to low doses of HAAs did not reproduce the genotoxic effects observed in acute treatments, where oxidative DNA damage was induced. No changes in the transformation endpoints analyzed were observed, as implied by the absence of significant morphological, cell growth rate and anchorage-independent cell growth pattern modifications. Interestingly, HAA-long-term exposed cells developed resistance to oxidative stress damage, what would explain the observed differences between acute and long-term exposure conditions. Accordingly, data obtained under long-term exposure to sub-toxic doses of HAAs could be more accurate, in terms of risk assessment, than under acute exposure scenarios.",

Some of these are mutagenic, genotoxic, teratogenic, and cytotoxic, as well as potentially carcinogenic both in vivo and in vitro. We investigated the in vitro biological activity of five DBPs: three monohaloacetic acids (monoHAAs) [chloroacetic acid (CAA), bromoacetic acid (BAA), and iodoacetic acid (IAA)] and two novel halobenzoquinones (HBQs) [2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ) and 2,6-dibromo-p-benzoquinone]. We focused particularly on cytotoxicity and induction of two adaptive stress response pathways: the oxidative stress responsive Nrf2/ARE and DNA-damage responsive p53 pathways. All five DBPs were cytotoxic to the Caco-2 cell line after a 4 hr exposure, and all DBPs induced both of the adaptive stress response pathways, Nrf2/ARE and p53, in the micromolar range, as measured by two beta-lactamase-based reporter gene assays. The decreasing order of potency for all three endpoints for the five DBPs was IAA /approximately equal to/ BAA > DCBQ /approximately equal to/ DBBQ > CAA. Induction of oxidative stress was previously proposed to be the molecular initiating event (MIE) for both classes of DBPs. However, comparing the levels of activation of the two pathways uncovered that the Nrf2/ARE pathway was the more sensitive endpoint for HAAs, whereas the p53 pathway was more sensitive in the case of HBQs. Therefore, the DNA damage-responsive p53 pathway may be an important piece of information to fill in a gap in the adverse outcome pathway framework for the assessment of HBQs. Finally, we ... compared the potential risk of the two novel HBQs using a benchmarking approach to that of the well-studied CAA, which suggested that their relative risk may be lower than that of BAA and IAA.",

In a previous study, the authors' group has detected the presence of many brominated DBPs and identified five new aromatic brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline sewage effluents. The presence of brominated DBPs in chlorinated saline effluents may pose adverse implications for marine ecology. In this study, besides the detection and identification of another seven new aromatic halogenated DBPs in a chlorinated saline sewage effluent, their developmental toxicity was evaluated using the marine polychaete Platynereis dumerilii. For comparison, the developmental toxicity of some commonly known halogenated DBPs was also examined. The rank order of the developmental toxicity of 20 halogenated DBPs was 2,5-dibromohydroquinone > 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol >/= 2,4,6-triiodophenol > 4-bromo-2-chlorophenol >/= 4-bromophenol > 2,4-dibromophenol >/= 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol > 2-bromo-4-chlorophenol > 2,6-dichloro-4-nitrophenol > 2,4-dichlorophenol > 2,4,6-tribromophenol > 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde > bromoform >/= 2,4,6-trichlorophenol > 2,6-dibromophenol > 2,6-dichlorophenol > iodoacetic acid ? tribromoacetic acid > bromoacetic acid > chloroacetic acid. On the basis of developmental toxicity data, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) was established. The QSAR involved two physical-chemical property descriptors (log P and pKa) and two electronic descriptors (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and the highest occupied molecular orbital energy) to indicate the transport, biouptake, and biointeraction of these DBPs. It can well predict the developmental toxicity of most of the DBPs tested.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates iodoacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase iodoacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 days. Iodoacetic acid absorbs UV light at wavelength 260 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm. If released to soil, iodoacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.4. The pKa of iodoacetic acid is 3.18, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Iodoacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil were not available; however, iodoacetic acid was susceptible to biodegradation by a Norcadia sp isolated from soil. If released into water, iodoacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation data in water were not available. However, iodoacetic acid was biodegraded 95-100% by Afipia spps isolated from drinking water enrichment cultures developed through acclimation to chloroacetic acids. A pKa of 3.18 indicates iodoacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to iodoacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where iodoacetic acid is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to iodoacetic acid via ingestion of chlorinated drinking water. A segment of the general population may also be exposed via medical imagining procedures using iodinated x-ray contrast media. (SRC)",

Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the compound exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Iodoacetic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 3.2X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2).

According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 0.85(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Iodoacetic acid is degraded in natural water by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in natural water is estimated to be about 41 minutes(SRC), calculated from a measured rate constant of 5.7X10-9 L/mol-sec(5).

Vapor-phase iodoacetic acid is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.9X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Iodoacetic acid absorbs UV light at wavelength 260 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis since sunlight consists of wavelengths above 290 nm(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This white solid is widely used in agriculture and the production of pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. It is also used as an alcohol deterrent drug in Canada, Europe and Japan. The molecule features a nitrile group attached to an amino group. Although it is similar in structure to hydrogen cyanide, it is not as toxic. Derivatives of this compound are also referred to as cyanamides, the most common being calcium cyanamide (CaCN2). Calcium cyanamide or CaCN2 is a calcium compound used as fertilizer, first synthesized in 1898 by Adolph Frank and Nikodem Caro (Frank-Caro process). It is formed when calcium carbide reacts with nitrogen. It is commercially known as Nitrolime. In enzymology, a cyanamide hydratase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

One i.v. administration of 1 mg/kg was performed in order to determine the absolute bioavailability and the main pharmacokinetic parameters. Elimination half life and total plasma clearance values were 51.7 8.8 min and 14.4 2.7 mL/kg/min respectively. After oral administrations of 0.3, 1 and 1.5 mg/kg a rapid absorption rate was estimated with a Tmax values range of 10.5 to 15.5 min. The extent of absorption was not complete, oral bioavailability being 53%, 70% and 81% respectively. The presence of a first pass-effect is suggested. The inhibitory activity of cyanamide on blood ALDH reached the maximum value 4 hr after its administration and decreased progressively throughout six days period. The cyanamide plasma levels time course did not correlated with the pharmacodynamic time course responses.",

An analytical method was developed to determine acetylcyanamide in the urine with a limit of quantification of <10 ug/l (mean recovery 96.1% using spikes of 20 ug/l; relative standard deviation < 4%. This methodology is based upon ion chromatography using column-switch techniques and UV detection. It could be demonstrated that in rats an average of 45.6% of oral applied cyanamide (10 mg/kg) was excreted in the urine as acetylcyanamide. In male human volunteers a mean of 40% of oral admin cyanamide (mean dose 0.25 mg/kg body weight) was excreted via the urine as acetylcyanamide. The same group of volunteers participated in skin absorption study with dermal application of the above cyanamide dose onto a skin surface area of 32 sq cm. Within an application period of 6 hr an average cyanamide quantity of 2.3 mg, was available for skin absorption. A mean portion of 7.7% of this quantity was found as acetylcyanamide in the urine of the participants. Findings from literature state that cyanamide is metabolized in vitro to cyanide. According to examinations performed in vivo, however, such a metabolic pathway seems to be irrelevant for man. In comparisons with the control values there was no significant incr of both the cyanide concn in the blood and the thiocyanate concentrations in the urine of the above volunteers after the described oral cyanamide admin.",

It is used to produce the herbicides Amitrol and Hexazinone and builds up the pyrimidine or 1,3,5-triazine subunit for a vast number of sulfonylurea herbicides like Bensulfuron or Metsulfuron methyl. The benzimidazole fungicides Carbendazim and Benomyl and the pyrimidine fungicides Cyprodinil, Pyrimethanil, and Mepanipyrim are based on cyanamide, as well as the pyrimidine insecticides Bupyrimate and Dimethirimol and neonicotinoids like Acetamiprid. Many fungicidal and biocidal guanidine and biguanide compounds like Dodine, Guazatine and Iminooctadine are based on cyanamide chemistry.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

The substance also inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can produce acetaldehyde syndrome (e.g., vomiting, parasympathetic hyperactivity, dyspnea, hypotension, and confusion) when exposure coincides with alcohol use. After Dormex ... , a pesticide product containing hydrogen cyanamide (49% by weight), was introduced in Italy in 2000, a total of 23 cases of acute illness associated with exposure to this chemical were identified in early 2001. This led to a temporary suspension of sales and usage of Dormex on February 23, 2002, and strengthening of protective measures, as specified on the pesticide label when sales were resumed on June 20, 2003.",

When cyanamide-treated alcoholics relapse into drinking, more severe inflammation develops in the liver. However, it is controversial whether progressive hepatic lesions develop in complete abstainers as a result of long-term cyanamide treatment. Case 1: A 53-year-old male alcoholic received cyanamide treatment for 4.5 months and completely abstained without cyanamide treatment for 6 years. A liver biopsy shortly after abstinence showed extensive pericellular fibrosis, but a biopsy after 6 years showed very mild fibrosis. Case 2: A 43-year-old male alcoholic remained completely abstinent with cyanamide treatment for 5 years and complained of general fatigue. His serum transaminases were slightly elevated and hepatic hyperechogenicity was observed on ultrasonography. Only mild pericellular fibrosis was present in the liver biopsy specimen obtained shortly after abstinence, but after 5 years the second liver biopsy showed that thin septum-like fibrosis that formed portal-to-portal and portal-to-central linkage had developed and ground-glass hepatocytes had emerged extensively. Case 3: A 29-year-old female alcoholic complained of general fatigue and a slight fever after 1.5 years of abstinence with cyanamide treatment. Slight elevation of serum transaminases and hepatic hyperechogenicity were observed. The liver biopsy showed extensive ground-glass hepatocytes and thin septum-like fibrosis that formed portal-to-portal linkage. Case 4: A 61-year-old male alcoholic who remained completely abstinent while taking cyanamide for 3 years showed slight elevation of serum transaminases. Liver biopsy showed extensive ground-glass hepatocytes and extension of thin septum-like fibers from portal tract to the lobule. Ultrasonography revealed hepatic hyperechogenicity. In some abstainers who take cyanamide for several years, thin septum-like liver fibrosis progresses along with the emergence of ground-glass hepatocytes. Hepatic hyperechogenicity on ultrasonography and slight elevation of serum transaminases might erroneously lead to a diagnosis of hepatic steatosis without liver histology.",

A 46-year-old Japanese man is described in whom a generalized eruption developed about 1 month after taking cyanamide, a drug for alcoholism. This was associated with the following manifestations: high fever, lymphadenopathy, facial edema, marked leukocytosis with eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes, lymphocytopenia, liver and renal dysfunction, and low IgG level. He was treated with 8 mg betamethasone daily and his condition improved, but he needed low-dose corticosteroid for almost 1 year because of several episodes of recurrence. Human herpesviris (HHV-6, HHV-7), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific IgG titers showed more than a four-fold rise sequentially. Significant numbers of copies of HHV-6 and HHV-7 DNA were detected in the peripheral white blood cells by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HHV-6 and CMV DNA were detected in the serum by nested PCR. A patch test for cyanamide was positive. The diagnosis of DIHS due to cyanamide, which has never been reported as a causal drug of DIHS, accompanied by reactivation of not only HHV-6, but also HHV-7, CMV, and HSV, was made. Disturbance of the immune system was suggested by the persistent low level of IgG, and consecutive viral reactivation may have participated in the prolonged course in this case.",

It consists of distinctive cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, similar to those observed in Lafora's disease. The inclusion body-bearing liver cells resemble the ground-glass hepatocytes observed in type B viral infections. This hepatocytic lesion is predictable and reproducible in the rat liver. ... In an attempt to discover if the chemical nature of the drug is an important determinant in the development of the lesion, the present study was carried out using groups of Wistar rats. One group received cyanamide and the other one calcium carbimide. The drug was placed in the stomach via a cannula, daily, at a dose of 16 mg/kg body weight, for 25 weeks. The characteristic inclusion bodies were only found in the group receiving plain cyanamide.",

It may also enter the environment in the wastewater effluent from nitroguanidine processes and by the abiotic breakdown of nitrosoguanidine. Cyanamide has been found in nature; hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) produces free cyanamide from inorganic nitrate as an allelochemical to compete against neighboring plants. Cyanamide is regarded as a key intermediate within chemical evolution on earth billions of years ago. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.75X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates cyanamide will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of cyanamide with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals can not be estimated, therefore, the half-life for this reaction in the atmosphere can not be estimated. Cyanamide does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, cyanamide is expected to have very high mobility based upon estimated Koc values of 4.7 and 7.3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.66X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. In soil, cyanamide is converted to nitrogenous compounds which are rapidly taken up. In aqueous soil conditions, cyanamide is expected to decompose by hydrolysis to urea and by dimerization to dicyanamide. If released into water, cyanamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Cyanamide decomposes in water by hydrolysis to urea in acidic conditions and by dimerization to dicyanamide in alkaline conditions. Occupational exposure to cyanamide may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where cyanamide is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization of cyanamide from water surfaces is not expected(4) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.66X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.75X10-3 mm Hg(3), and water solubility, 7.8X10+5 mg/L(3). Cyanamide decomposes in water by hydrolysis to urea in acidic conditions and by dimerization to dicyanamide in alkaline conditions(5,6). Cyanamide does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on sunlit water(SRC).",

Cyanamide is stable to light(3); the UV spectrum of cyanamide shows only weak absorption below 230 nm, with no maximum observable above 208 nm(1), therefore, direct photolysis will not occur in sunlight. The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of cyanamide with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals can not be estimated(4,SRC), therefore, the half-life for this reaction in the atmosphere can not be estimated.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

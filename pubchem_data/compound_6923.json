Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to the atmosphere, 2-t-butylphenol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases based on an experimental vapor pressure of 1.5X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase 2-t-butylphenol should be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 9.5 hours. Particulate-phase 2-t-butylphenol may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. 2-t-Butylphenol is expected to have low mobility in soil based on an estimated Koc value of 1500. An estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-6 suggests that volatilization from moist soil surfaces will be slow. Limited data, mainly derived by analogy to 4-t-butylphenol, indicate that 2-t-butylphenol may be resistant to biodegradation in soil and water environments. 4-t-Butylphenol (at 30 mg/l) was not biodegraded over a 2 week period using an activated sludge inoculum; in river and sea water 11% of the initial concentration of 4-t-butylphenol was biodegraded over 3 days. An estimated BCF value of 190 indicates bioconcentration in aquatic organisms may be an important fate process. This compound was rapidly taken up by zebra fish with a steady state concentration reached within 5 hours; the clearance phase required 6 hours. 2-t-Butylphenol may volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 31 and 230 days, respectively. Exposure to 2-t-butylphenol may occur occupationally during its production or use in the manufacture of other products. (SRC)",

Limited data, mainly derived by analogy to 4-t-butylphenol, indicate that 2-t-butylphenol may be resistant to biodegradation(SRC). 4-t-Butylphenol (at 30 mg/L) was not biodegraded over a 2 week period using an activated sludge inoculum(4); in river and sea water 4-t-butylphenol showed 11% biodegradation over 3 days(5). However, resting cells of a Pseudomonas strain obtained by selective enrichment with 4-hydroxybenzoate as the sole carbon source, were able to biodegrade 2-t-butylphenol (oxygen uptake rate 26 nmol O2/min/mg protein)(6). Volatilization of 2-t-butylphenol from moist soil surfaces would be slow(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(7,SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

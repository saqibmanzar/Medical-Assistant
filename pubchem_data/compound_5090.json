Stilbenes (C6-C2-C6 ) are derived from the common phenylpropene (C6-C3) skeleton building block. The introduction of one or more hydroxyl groups to a phenyl ring lead to stilbenoids. Rofecoxib has a half-life of 17 hours and its mean oral bioavailability at therapeutically recommended doses of 125, 25, and 50 mg is approximately 93%. The proteins that rofecoxib target include elastin and prostaglandin G/H synthase 2. Cytochrome P450 1A2, Cytochrome P450 3A4, Cytochrome P450 2C9, Cytochrome P450 2C8, and Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 are known to metabolize rofecoxib. On September 30, 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

We examined the risk of new onset hypertension in a retrospective case-control study involving 17 844 subjects aged > or =65 years from 2 US states. Multivariable logistic models were examined to assess the relative risk of new onset hypertension requiring treatment in patients who used celecoxib or rofecoxib compared with patients taking either the other COX-2 specific inhibitor, a nonspecific NSAID, or no NSAID. During the 1999 to 2000 study period, 3915 patients were diagnosed and began treatment for hypertension; 4 controls were selected for every case. In no model was celecoxib significantly associated with the development of hypertension. Rofecoxib users were at a significantly increased relative risk of new onset hypertension compared with patients taking celecoxib (odds ratio (OR) 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2 to 2.1), taking a nonspecific NSAID (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.9), or taking no NSAID (OR 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.0). There were no clear dosage or duration effects. In patients with a history of chronic renal disease, liver disease, or congestive heart failure, the relative risk of new onset hypertension was twice as high in those taking rofecoxib compared with celecoxib (OR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 4.3). In this retrospective case-control study of patients aged > or =65 years, rofecoxib use was associated with an increased relative risk of new onset hypertension; this was not seen in patients taking celecoxib.",

Serum CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), P-selectin, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and brachial artery endothelial function were evaluated. In the placebo group, CRP (median) was 3.16 mg/L (25% and 75% quartiles, 1.90 and 5.78 mg/L) at baseline and 4.22 mg/L (25% and 75% quartiles, 2.04 and 6.25 mg/L) at 6 months; in the rofecoxib group, CRP was 3.45 mg/L (25% and 75% quartiles, 2.08 and 5.78 mg/L) at baseline and 1.41 mg/L (25% and 75% quartiles, 1.17 and 4.81 mg/L) at 6 months (P=0.03). Rofecoxib compared with placebo also lowered IL-6 at 6 months (P=0.0002). There was a significant off-drug effect on CRP and IL-6 levels in the rofecoxib group 3 months after treatment (P=0.005 and P=0.009, respectively). Rofecoxib did not significantly affect P-selectin, MMP-9, and brachial artery vasoreactivity. Prolonged COX-2 inhibition attenuates CRP and IL-6, does not modify P-selectin and MMP-9, and has no deleterious effect on endothelial function in stable patients with a history of recurrent acute coronary events and raised CRP. These results strengthen the rationale for evaluating the clinical benefit of COX-2 inhibition in patients with ischemic heart disease.",

Six months after initiation of rofecoxib, linear plaques over the infra-orbital and bitemporal areas of both eyes were observed. Several itchy violaceous papules also developed on her right wrist and dorsum of the left foot. She also had a hyperpigmented macule on her right buccal mucosa. As the skin rash was localized and the patient was initially unwilling to undergo skin biopsy, rofecoxib was continued and a topical steroid was started. One month later, the patient was seen in the dermatology clinic, and the improvement of her skin reaction was significant. A skin biopsy performed during this visit was consistent with LDE. On the next day, her rheumatologist decided to discontinue the offending drug, rofecoxib. Two months later, all skin lesions had completely resolved. No rechallenge with rofecoxib was attempted. LDE is a rare skin reaction that can be associated with several drugs. Rofecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, has never before been reported to cause LDE. An objective causality assessment indicates that rofecoxib was the probable cause of the skin reaction.",

Unlike celecoxib, rofecoxib lacks a sulfonamide chain and does not require CYP450 enzymes for metabolism. Like other NSAIDs, rofecoxib exhibits anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity. NSAIDs appear to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), which are responsible for catalyzing the formation of prostaglandins in the arachidonic acid pathyway. There are at least two isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, that have been identified. Although the exact mechanisms have not been clearly established, NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic primarily through the inhibition of COX-2. The inhibition of COX-1 is principally responsible for the negative effects on the GI mucosa.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

In incubations with S9 fractions, metabolites resulting from both oxidative and reductive pathways were observed. In contrast to microsomes, the oxidation of rofecoxib to 5-hydroxyrofecoxib by S9 fractions followed two pathways, one NADPH-dependent and one NAD+-dependent (non-cytochrome P450), with the latter accounting for about 40% of total activity. The 5-hydroxyrofecoxib thus formed was found to undergo NADPH-dependent reduction (\"back reduction\") to rofecoxib in incubations with liver cytosolic fractions. In incubations with dialyzed liver cytosol, net hydration of rofecoxib to form 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxyrofecoxib was observed, whereas the 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid derivatives were formed when NADPH was present. Although 3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxyrofecoxib could be reduced to the 3,4-dihydrohydroxy acid by cytosol in the presence of NADPH, the former species does not appear to serve as an intermediate in the overall reductive pathway of rofecoxib metabolism. In incubations of greater than 2 h with S9 fractions, net reductive metabolism predominated over oxidative metabolism. These in vitro results are consistent with previous findings on the metabolism of rofecoxib in vivo in human and provide a valuable insight into mechanistic aspects of the complex metabolism of this drug.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Rofecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme, which is important for the mediation of inflammation and pain.

The reaction with trifluorosulfonyl anhydride and diisopropylethylamine in CH2Cl2 affords the corresponding trifluorosulfonate, which by reaction with LiBr in hot acetone yields the bromofuranone. The coupling with 4-(methylsulfanyl)phenylboronic acid with Na2CO3 and Pd[(C6H5)3P]4 as catalysts in hot toluene gives 4-[4-(methylsulfanyl)phenyl]-3-phenylfuran-2(5H)-one, which is finally oxidized with 2KHSO5.KHSO4.K2SO4(oxone)",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

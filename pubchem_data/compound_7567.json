ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.3X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be one hour. Particulate-phase bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane is expected to be immobile based upon a Koc of 9,100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCF values of 423 and 690 suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to bis(p-(dimethylamino)phenyl)methane via dermal contact with contaminated soil at disposal sites from dye manufacturing.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

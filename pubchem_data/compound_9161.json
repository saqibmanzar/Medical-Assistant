The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Subadult fish were exposed to 10 mg of each chemical over 5 days and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels were monitored during the following 25 days. The results indicated that PAHs were not accumulated by trout through dietary exposure because of the combined effects of poor absorption efficiencies and rapid elimination rates. Phenyl naphthalene was more persistent than the other PAHs examined, with a half-life of 25 days.",

Both organisms oxidized acenaphthene to the same spectrum of metabolites, which included 1-acenaphthenol, 1-acenaphtheneone, 1,2-acenaphthenediol, acenaphthenequinone, and a compound that was tentatively identified as 1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthylene. In contrast, acenaphthylene was oxidized to acenaphthenequinone and the compound tentatively identified as 1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthylene was also formed when the organism was incubated with synthetic cis-1,2-acenaphthenediol. A metabolite identified as cis-1,2-acenaphthenediol was formed from acenaphthylene by the mutant Beijerinckia species strain B8/36. Cell extracts prepared from the wild-type Beijerinckia strain contain a constitutive pyridine nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase which can oxidize 1-acenaphthenol and 9-fluorenol. The results indicate that although acenaphthene and acenaphthylene are both oxidized to acenaphthenequinone, the pathways leading to the formation of this end product are different.",

Metabolites produced were analyzed and characterized by TLC, HPLC, and mass spectrometry. Identification of naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid, 1-naphthoic acid, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylate and detection of key enzymes namely 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase, and catechol-1,2-dioxygenase in the cell free extract suggest that acenaphthylene metabolized via 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylate and catechol. The terminal metabolite, catechol was then metabolized by catechol-1,2-dioxygenase to cis,cis-muconic acid, ultimately forming TCA cycle intermediates. Based on these studies, the proposed metabolic pathway in strain RMSK is,acenaphthylene --> naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid --> 1-naphthoic acid --> 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene --> salicylic acid --> catechol --> cis,cis-muconic acid.",

This strain was able to degrade 600 mg/liter acenaphthylene completely within three days. To elucidate the pathway for degradation of acenaphthylene, strain CU-A1 was mutagenized by transposon Tn5 in order to obtain mutant strains deficient in acenaphthylene degradation. Metabolites produced from Tn5-induced mutant strains B1, B5, and A53 were purified by thin-layer chromatography and silica gel column chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry. The results suggested that this strain cleaved the fused five-membered ring of acenaphthylene to form naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid via acenaphthenequinone. One carboxyl group of naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid was removed to form 1-naphthoic acid which was transformed into salicylic acid before metabolization to gentisic acid.",

PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil. They can occur in the air, either attached to dust particles or as solids in soil or sediment. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

The analytical technique utilized reverse phase HPLC for separation of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, with fluorescence detection, which is sensitive and specific. A specific sample cleanup was employed prior to measurement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, designed to provide a fraction enriched in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and free from the biologic matrix. Sample extracts, in 0.5 mL hexane, were applied to a silica gel column (0.8X10 cm, 1.4 g) topped with 0.5 cm sodium sulfate. A 4 mL hexane fraction was discarded, and a second fraction of 13 mL cyclohexane was collected and concentrated under dry nitrogen to about 0.1 mL. In six serum samples, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were below the limit of detection (1-60 pg/mL). /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Blood polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) levels in children, including acenaphthylene, significantly correlated with oxidative stress and altered antioxidant status. It induced cytokine production and reduced nitric oxide formation in human coronary artery endothelial cell cultures. Metabolic activation of PAHs and aryl- and heterocyclic amines to genotoxic products was examined in Salmonella typhimurium, and it was found that P450 2A13 and 2A6 (as well as P450 1B1) were able to activate several of these procarcinogens. Acenaphthylene is oxidized by human P450s 2A6 and 2A13 and other P450s to form several mono- and dioxygenated products. It is not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. ANIMAL STUDIES: No tumors were observed in a lifetime study when 0.25% acenaphthylene was applied to the skin of mice. Survival was 65% at 6 months, and 35% at 1 year. Acenaphthylene is an aromatic hydrocarbon-responsive receptor (AHR)-independent inducer of murine CYP1A2 and CYP1B1 mRNA. Acenaphthylene (1 mM) yielded positive results in a Salmonella typhimurium forward mutation assay, but was not positive in a Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 with metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Acenaphthylene modified the hemolytic alternative complement activity after 4 hr of incubation in peripheral blood of the European sea bass. It was also directly cytotoxic to a cell line from the rainbow trout gill.",

These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates.

Examination of the oral cavity, respiratory tract, bladder, and kidneys should be stressed. The skin should be examined for evidence of chronic disorders, for premalignant and malignant lesions, and evidence of hyperpigmentation or photosensitivity. Urinalysis: ... A urinalysis should be obtained to include at a minimum specific gravity, albumin, glucose, and a microscopic /examination/ on centrifuged sediment, as well as a test for red blood cells. Urinary cytology: ... Employees having 5 or more years of exposure or who are 45 years of age or older should have a urinary cytology examination. Sputum cytology: ...

Surveillance of the lungs is indicated. FVC and FEV (1 sec): Coal tar pitch volatiles are reported to cause an excess of bronchitis. Periodic surveillance is indicated. A complete blood count: Due to the possibility of benzene exposure associated with coal tar pitch volatiles, a complete blood count is considered necessary to search for leukemia and aplastic anemia. The aforementioned medical examinations should be repeated on an annual basis, and semi-annually for employees 45 years of age or older or with 10 or more years' exposure to coal tar pitch volatiles. /Coal tar pitch volatiles/",

They are reported to alter trophoblast proliferation in placenta, in addition to disturbing its endocrine functions, which may be able to increase the risk of preterm delivery in pregnant women. The present study was planned to assess possible involvement of PAHs exposure of pregnant women (measured as placental PAHs concentrations) with preterm delivery cases among women of Lucknow city (India). We performed a case-control study and a total of 60 mothers (n=31 full term and n=29 preterm deliveries) were recruited at a local nursing home of Lucknow, for the period of August 2005-February 2006. Subsequent to parturition, placental tissues from each participant were immediately collected and kept at -20 degrees C until PAHs analyses. Placental tissue PAHs concentrations were determined by HPLC, using a fluorescence detector. Mean+/-SD placental level (61.91+/-12.43 ppb) of benzo(b)fluoranthene, a carcinogenic PAH, was found significantly elevated (p<0.05) among women with preterm delivery when compared with the level (23.84+/-7.01 ppb) in women having full-term deliveries. In the same way, non-carcinogenic fluoranthene level (325.91+/-45.14 ppb) was also detected to be higher in the preterm delivery group compared to 208.6+/-21.93 ppb level from the full-term delivery group of women. Additionally naphthalene, acenaphthylene, phenanthrene, anthracene, benzo(a)pyrene and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene levels in placental tissue were also found to be higher in the preterm delivery group of women but the difference did not reach statistically significant levels. This foremost study from India with modest sample size and limited statistical power does not show a substantial involvement of PAHs with preterm delivery, but higher concentrations of placental PAHs detected among preterm delivery group of women could show some possible association with these environmental toxicants. Further study with large sample size, controlled for confounders and great statistical power, is reasonable to elucidate the association of PAHs exposure with preterm delivery of women in India.",

It is believed that many diseases that have a common origin in oxidative stress begin in childhood. Considering oxidative stress evolved during PAHs metabolism as one main mechanism responsible for health hazards related to PAHs exposure in children, we biomonitored blood PAHs levels in connection with redox status among children of Lucknow (India). The study consisted of children (n=50) who visited to the Pediatrics Department (KGMU) Lucknow for usual health check-up camp over the study period (August 2005-July 2006). Blood samples were drawn and levels of acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, naphthalene, pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene and benzo(a)pyrene were determined by HPLC-FD/UV. Malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were also determined to evaluate redox status. Significantly elevated carcinogenic blood PAHs levels (125.55 +/- 26.99 ppb, p<0.05) were found in rural children compared to children from urban region (23.96 +/- 13.46 ppb). Results revealed that remoteness between residence and highway/traffic, significantly influences the blood levels of carcinogenic PAHs. There were significant correlations between total PAHs and MDA (r=0.82, p<0.001), carcinogenic PAHs and SOD activity (r=0.35, p<0.01), Total PAHs and blood GSH level (r=- 0.49, p<0.01) and carcinogenic PAHs and CAT activity (r=0.42, p<0.01). Blood MDA level was also found correlated with increasing body mass index (BMI) (r=0.29, p<0.05). /These/ results showed blood PAHs levels in children significantly correlated with oxidative stress and altered antioxidant status. It supports our hypothesis that the children exposed to high PAHs level will suffer more to oxidative stress that may lead to possible health risks. Additional studies with large sample size are considered necessary to strengthen the database and also to explore the PAHs associated health risks in children.",

Children are exposed to these compounds through inhalation, dietary ingestion, and, also, soil at the playground. It has been well established that PAHs have carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects. Considering possible health risks due to PAHs exposure among children, the present study was carried out in collaboration with the Pediatrics Department, King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, to determine its exposure in children by estimating blood PAHs levels. Due to the variable composition of PAHs mixtures emitted from different environmental sources, any single compound or metabolite may not be representative of all exposure conditions. For these reasons, the measurement of blood PAHs levels as a possible biomarker, especially of the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency, USA) priority list, has been proposed. Acenaphthylene, anthracene, phenanthrene, fluoranthene, naphthalene, pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, and benzo(a)pyrene were determined by HPLC-FD/UV. On the basis of the individual compound, the median (50th percentile) of naphthalene (19 ppb) was highest; however, benzo(a)pyrene (4.0 ppb) level was found to be lowest among all detected PAHs. The median level of total noncarcinogenic PAHs (113.55 ppb) was higher than the total carcinogenic PAHs (32.35 ppb) in blood samples of children. A significant correlation was found between period of time spent in the surrounding breathing zone of the cooking place and total noncarcinogenic PAHs (p<0.05), while the blood carcinogenic PAHs level in children was found to be associated with lower status of their families /SRP: socioeconomic status/ (p<0.05). It is speculated that there may be chances of health hazards through exposure to PAHs, those not yet declared hazardous and present at higher concentrations in the Indian environment. Further study with a larger sample size and accompanying environmental data is desired to validate the findings of this pilot study and strengthen the database of PAHs exposure in India.",

This study aims to establish methods for assessing total PAH exposure of asthmatic and non-asthmatic children from low-income families; to estimate serum PAH concentrations of these children, and to estimate the relative importance of the environmental pathways for PAH exposure. A total of 75 (61 asthmatic, 14 non-asthmatic) Saudi children 15 years old and below were included to participate in this cross-sectional study. Each participant answered a generalized questionnaire with dietary questions. Serum PAH were measured using HPLC with UV detection. Serum naphthalene and pyrene were significantly elevated among asthmatic children (p-values = 0.007 and 0.01, respectively). Serum acenaphthylene, fluorine and 1,2-benzanthracene, on the other hand, were significantly higher among non-asthmatics (p-values = 0.001, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively). There was a significant correlation between the presence of a smoker in the family and serum concentrations of carbazole, pyrene, 1,2-benzanthracene, and benzacephenanthrylene (R = 0.37, 0.45, 0.43, 0.33; p-values = 0.01, 0.0002, 0.003, and 0.025, respectively). Significant correlations were elicited between daily meat intake and serum levels of acenaphthylene, benzopyrene and 1,2-benzanthracene (R = 0.27, 0.27, 0.33; p-values = 0.02 and < 0.001, respectively). Among the children, serum PAH were significantly correlated to meat intake as well as presence of smokers at home. Public health awareness should be enhanced by educating parents to take certain precautions at home, such as preventing indoor smoking and reducing the intake of grilled and smoked meat by children so as to decrease their exposure to carcinogenic PAH.",

The objectives of this study are to examine particle size and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) effects of particles on coronary artery endothelial cell. We used two micro-orifice uniform deposit impactors to collect 11 sets of particles at a Chinese temple in Yi-Lan, Taiwan. 16 PAHs were determined by a high-resolution gas chomatograph/high-resolution mass spectrometer. Human coronary artery endothelial cells were exposed to particle extracts in three size ranges: PM(0.1) (diameters less than 0.1 um), PM(1.0-0.1) (diameters between 1.0 and 0.1 um), and PM(10-1.0) (diameters between 10 and 1.0 um) at 50 ug/mL for 4 hr, and interleukin-6 (IL-6), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in the medium were measured. We found that PM(1.0-0.1) stimulation resulted in significantly higher IL-6 and ET-1 production than PM(0.1) and PM(10-1.0). PM(1.0-0.1) also significantly reduced HCAEA cells to synthesize NO. Naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, and anthracene of PM(1.0-0.1) were highly correlated with NO reduction. This study found that size and composition of temple particles were both important factors in inducing cytokine production and reducing NO formation in human coronary artery endothelial cell cultures.",

Although acenaphthene and acenaphthylene were non-mutagenic, all the 1,2-ring fused acenaphthene were found to be indirect frameshift mutagens in strain TA1537. The chemical nature of the 1,2-fused ring did not appear to be important for mutagenic activity against TA1537; however, its nature did affect the mutagenesis of strain TA1538. Only acenaphthenes fused with a pyrimidine or pyrazine ring were capable of mutating the hiD 3052 locus of TA1538. Substitution at the 8-position of the ring system with an amino group rendered the molecule inactive against TA1538, whilst substitution at the 10-position only reduced, but did not eliminate the mutagenic effect against TA1538. Methyl substitution at various sites on the molecule modified the mutagenic activity against TA1537, and indicated the formation of an electrophilic species (epoxide) at the 2,3-position of the acenaphthene nucleus. The incorporation of a competitive substrate for ring hydroxylation (naphthalene) reduced the mutagenic effect of acenaphthopyrimidine against TA1537 and confirmed this assumption. However, naphthalene did not reduce the mutagenic effect of the compound against TA1538, indicating the possible formation of a second metabolite by an alternative enzymic pathway. The fusion of a pyridine ring to the system to give a pentacyclic compound resulted in a molecule sufficiently planar to allow for a weak direct mutagenic effect against TA1537.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were responsible for an unquantified portion of the mutagenic activity. In general, the phagocytic activity of pulmonary alveolar macrophages appeared to be the most sensitive function in response to the toxic action of rice straw smoke particulate matter.

Concentrations of summation operator PAHs in livers of sea otters were in the range of 588-17400 ng/g lipid wt (mean: 3880 ng/g, lipid wt). On a wet weight basis, the concentrations ranged from 17 to 1430 ng/g (mean: 146 ng/g). Overall, di- and tri-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, namely, naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene/anthracene, and acenaphthylene, were the predominant compounds found in the livers. Although petroleum-related sources appear to be the major contributors to PAH exposure in sea otters, exposure sources varied by geographical sub-regions. Dibenz[a,h]anthracene was found to comprise a significant proportion of the summation operatorPAH concentrations in sea otters from the northern sub-region of the study area. No significant difference existed in the concentrations of summation operatorPAHs among sea otters that died from infectious diseases, emaciation, and noninfectious causes. Concentrations of summation operatorPAHs in livers of sea otters decreased significantly from 1992 to 2002. Because of the rapid metabolism of PAHs in marine mammals such as sea otters, further studies examining the association of PAHs with health effects should determine hydroxylated metabolites in livers.",

Median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the WSF were found to decrease as a function of exposure time from 690+/-21 (after 24 hr) to 513+/-58 mg/L (after 96 hr). The characteristics of the WSF such as mean acidity (pH 6.6), turbidity (40 NTU), total dissolved solids (TDS; 40 mg/L) and significantly reduced (P<0.05) dissolved-oxygen (DO) values (1.44 mg/l) were not compliant with existing standards set for discharged effluents. The solubility of the detected straight-chain aliphatics ranked as C14>C16>C32>C18>C28; that of the simple aromatics was ortho-xylene>para-xylene; and that of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was acenaphthylene > 9Hfluorene >naphthalene >anthracene >phenanthrene >chrysene >benzo[k]fluoranthene >benzo[a]pyrene >benzo[b]fluoranthene, most of which being serious carcinogens. These oil constituents and the overall physico-chemical properties of the WSF are expected to act synergistically on the test organism (C. gariepinus), eliciting the quantal responses observed. The toxicity of the WSF points to the base constituent, oxidative degradation, and mechano-chemical reactions associated with aged crankcase oils. These oils, therefore, should definitely no longer be disposed into water streams or landscape, not even at sublethal concentrations, because of the inherent toxicity of their soluble fractions and the associated danger of bioaccumulation.",

Peripheral blood from 105 fish was collected, centrifuged at 1200 g, for 10 min, at 4 \u00b0C and three plasma pools, each of 35 fish, were constituted. Two oils (heavy fuel oil and light cycle oil) and 16 pure PAHs, selected on the basis of the American Environmental Protection Agency list (US EPA), were tested in vitro on the two humoral immune parameters. Only three pure PAHs (anthracene, chrysene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene) modulated lysozyme concentration. Acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, anthracene, benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, pyrene, and light cycle oil modified the hemolytic alternative complement activity after 4 hr of incubation. This study investigates the direct effects of several PAHs on fish humoral immune functions and describes the hemolytic complement activity of fish as suitable biomarkers of oil pollution.",

This was achieved by studying their lytic or antilytic effects on fish erythrocytes in critical hypotonic saline media. The interaction of PAHs acute potency divisor concentrations with mudskipper erythrocyte causes dramatic changes in the structure of the membrane. A significant difference (p<0.05) was found between the control and treatment groups of mudskipper erythrocyte exposed to acute potency divisor concentrations. No significant difference (p>0.05) was observed between the control and the treatment groups of mudskipper erythrocyte exposed to field concentrations. The results showed that chronic potency divisor concentrations of PAHs protect mudskipper erythrocyte against osmotic hemolysis. Our results could be extended to the use of Erythrocyte Osmotic Fragility (EOF) test as a biochemical marker of membrane toxicity in marine pollution biomonitoring. However, results showed that membrane stability is not an appropriate biomarker for PAHs pollution after short exposure duration.",

                                                    "String": "Acenaphthylene is a member of a group of chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). It occurs fly ash emissions from municipal incineration. Acenaphthylene is emitted to the environment in effluents from petroleum refining and other industries and in municipal wastewater effluents. Acenaphthylene is emitted in exhaust from gasoline and diesel engine vehicles. It also occurs in emissions from the combustion of scrap tires, coal, biomass and wood. Acenaphthylene occurs in mainstream cigarette smoke. Acenaphthylene is a component of crude oil, shale oil and coal tar. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0048 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acenaphthylene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. However, outdoor monitoring studies have shown that acenaphthylene can exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase acenaphthylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals, with ozone and with night-time nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 3.5 hours, 0.7 hours and 10 minutes respectively. Particulate-phase acenaphthylene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Acenaphthylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, acenaphthylene is expected to have no mobility based upon a Koc range of 5260 to 1.6X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.25X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate the rate of volatilization. Acenaphthylene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The biodegradation half-life of acenaphthylene in soil has been reported to range from 12 to 121 days. The presence of acclimated microbes appears to be an important factor in the degradation rate. Photolysis is expected to occur on surfaces exposed to sunlight. If released into water, acenaphthylene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Acenaphthylene was shown to biodegrade readily using acclimated groundwater inoculum, but not biodegradable using unacclimated inoculum in the Japanese MITI test. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 hours and 7.5 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is on the order of 3 to 20 months if adsorption is considered. A BCF range of 225-545 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. PAHs may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as some fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to acenaphthylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acenaphylthene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to acenaphthylene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing acenaphthylene.

Volatilization of acenaphthylene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.25X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate the rate of volatilization(SRC). Although acenaphthylene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.0048 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5), microcosm tests have shown that volatilization can be more important than biodegradation under various conditions(6,7). The reported biodegradation half-lives for acenaphthylene in aerobic soil range from 12 to 121 days(8). The presence of acclimated microbes appears to be an important factor in the degradation rate(9). Acenaphthylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(10) and is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(11).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.25X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 12 hours and 7.5 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is on the order of 3 to 20 months if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an observed BCF range of 225-545(8,9) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). PAHs may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as some fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(10). Acenaphthylene has been shown to biodegrade readily in groundwater having acclimated microbes (nearly complete degradation in 3 days)(11) and in static-culture flask-screening procedures using domestic wastewater inoculum(12). In contrast, a 0% of theoretical BOD using non-acclimated activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(8) demonstrates that biodegradation can be a slow environmental process(SRC). Acenaphthylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Acenaphthylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(13) and is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis at water surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

However, gas/particle partitioning studies in chambers and outdoor monitoring have shown that similar PAHS, such as acenaphthene, can exist in both the vapor and particulate phases(3). Ambient monitoring has also detected acenaphthylene in both vapor and paticulate phases(4). Vapor-phase acenaphthylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.09X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(5). Vapor-phase acenaphthylene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone and night-time nitrate radicals(SRC); the half-life for these reactions in air is estimated to be 0.7 hours and 10 minutes(SRC), calculated from their rate constants of 3.99X10-16 and 4.42X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C respectively(6).

Acenaphthylene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(2). Flask studies using groundwater from a creosote site and some surface soil found that an initial concentration of 0.6 ug/mL acenaphthylene was reduced to 0.2 ug/mL after 14 days of incubation while in sterile controls, reduction reached 0.4 ug/mL(3). Using a static-culture flask-screening procedure and a settled domestic wastewater inoculum, acenaphthylene (at 5 and 10 mg/L) showed major degradation and adaptation with 91-100% biodegradability after 7 days and three subsequent 7-day subcultures(4).",

The succeeding first order rate constants are 0.0116, 0.0152, 0.0562 and 0.163 day-1, with a second order rate constant of 0.0181 day-1; which correspond to half-lives of 60, 45.6, 12.3, 42.5 and 121.3 days for acenaphthylene(2). Acenaphthylene at a concentration of 1 mg/g disappeared from a Nixon sandy loam soil within 4 months(3); however, acenaphthylene loss from poisoned controls after 16 months of incubation in the dark at 20 \u00b0C suggested volatilization could more important than biodegradation(3). Flooded soil tests conducted in erlenmeyer flasks under aerobic conditions determined acenaphthylene biodegradation and volatilization rates of 0.53 and 1.60 ppm/day respectively using an initial concentration of 100 ppm dry soil(4).",

The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of acenaphthylene with ozone has been measured as 3.99X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 0.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of acenaphthylene with night-time nitrate radicals is 4.42X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 10 minutes at an atmospheric concentration of 2.5X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(3). Acenaphthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Photolytic half-lives of acenaphthylene absorb onto silica gel, alumina and fly ash were 0.7, 2.2 and 44 hours, respectively; when placed in a Pyrex photoreactor and exposed to a 450W medium pressure mercury lamp, which had an irradiance of 17.6 W/sq m between the spectral region of 300 to 410 nm(5). The photolysis of acenaphthylene, sorbed on surfaces of needles of a spruce tree, had a half-life of 27 hours under sunlight irradation(6). Acenaphthylene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(7).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

Using yearling carp (Cyprinus carpio) and OECD Guideline 305, average acenaphthylene BCF values of 271-279 were determined using average acenaphthylene concentrations of 4.34-4.55 mg/L(2). According to a classification scheme(3), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). PAHs may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). Some marine organisms have no detectable aryl hydrocarbons hydroxylase enzyme systems, namely: phytoplankton, certain zooplankton, mussels (Mytilus edulis), scallops (Placopecten sp), and snails (Litternia littorea)(5). Those organisms which lack a metabolic detoxification enzyme system, tend to accumulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that acenaphthylene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 12 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 7.5 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is on the order of 3 to 20 months if adsorption is considered(3). Acenaphthylene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Acenaphthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.0048 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). However, it has been reported that the lower molecular weight PAHs, including acenaphthylene, may volatilize from soil(5). Results of one soil degradation study suggested that volatilization of acenaphthylene could be more important than biodegradation under some conditions(6). Flooded soil tests conducted in Erlenmeyer flasks under aerobic conditions determined acenaphthylene biodegradation and volatilization rates of 0.53 and 1.60 ppm/day respectively using an initial concentration of 100 ppm in dry soil(7).",

Acenaphthylene was detected at 2 of 4 sampling stations along the Mississippi River at an average concentration of 3 ng/L in the summer of 1984(3). Ohio River water contained acenaphthylene at the cities of Wheeling(5). Sampling conducted at four sites of the southern Chesapeake Bay in 1994 found mean acenaphthylene concentrations of 0.291-0.546 and 0.021-0.049 ng/L in the dissolved and particulate phase of the water, respectively(6).",

On-road testing of nine heavy-duty diesel vehicles in California detected acenaphthylene emission rates of approximately 0.01-0.04 mg/mile(4). Dynamometer testing of a gasoline-powered automobile and an automobile powered by liquified petroleum gas found mean acenaphthylene emission factors of 76.9 and 14.6 ug/km respectively(5).

Sediments collected from Hamilton Harbour and Fawn Lake, Ontario in 1987 contained acenaphthylene concentrations ranging from not detectable (not specified) to 0.839 ug/g wet wt(4). Acenaphthylene comprised roughly 0.5% of the total PAHs detected in sediment samples collected from the Pearl River estuary and adjacent northern South China Sea in July 2002(5).

Farm soils from organically-grown vegetable farms in Eygpt were found to contain mean acenaphthylene concentrations of 0.23 to 4.23 ug/kg dry wt(3). Soil samples taken from 23 sites in Switzerland in 2002 by the Swiss Soil Monitoring Network (NABO) had mean and median acenaphthylene concentrations of 0.6 and 0.5 ug/kg dry wt respectively(4). Soils collected from nine vegetable fields of the Pearl River Delta, South China in 2002 had mean acenaphylthene levels of not detectable (not specified) to 1900 ng/kg(5). The mean acenaphthylene concentration found in nearly 200 rural soil samples collected from around Great Britain was 5.91 ng/g dry wt(6). The mean acenaphthylene level of 182 Japanese paddy soils sampled between 1959-2002 was 4.71 ug/kg dry wt(7). Agricultural soils sampled in eastern Poland had a geometric mean acenaphthylene concentration of 1 ug/kg(8).

Combustion of polystyrene was found to emit gaseous acenaphthylene at a yield of 2.136 mg/g of polystyrene(2). Studies involving the combustion of scrap tires determined acenaphthylene emission rates of 3-250 mg/kg scrap tire(3). Average acenaphthylene emission factors of 0.308-22.08 mg/kg were determined for open burning of various agricultural and forest biomass fuels(4). Weathered bottom ash collected from four Swedish municipal solid waste incinerators in 1996 contained acenaphthylene levels 31-355 ug/kg(5). Testing conducted between 1990-1992 determined average acenaphthylene levels of 1.83 ug/cu m were emitted from wood combustion(6). Acenaphthylene occurs as a coal combustion by-product at emission rates of 14.2 to 1914.5 ug/g of coal depending on combustion temperature(7). Residental wood combustion from fireplaces and stoves had acenaphthene emission rates of 4.97-8.67 mg/kg wood(8). Indoor combustion of biomass for heating and cooking (cotton stalk, wheat straw) was found to emit acenaphthylene at roughly 0.06 fraction of all PAH emissions(9).",

The total concentrations of 17 PAHs (summation operator PAHs) in the chamber were 3500 and 1152 ng/cu m in vapor phase and particulate phase, respectively. In vapor phase, the yield of naphthalene (NA) appeared to be the most abundant (2462 ng/cig) followed by fluorene (FLUOR) and acenaphthylene (ACY), while the yield of benzo[ghi]perylene (BP) was the most abundant (259.7 ng/cig) in particulate phase followed by phenanthrene (PHEN) and FLUOR. The proportion of PAHs in particulate phase increased with increasing molecular weight. PAHs with two to six rings accounted for 40.2%, 35.3%, 11.7%, 7.6%, 5.2% of summation operator PAHs, respectively. There was no obvious correlation between PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) concentrations in tobacco smoke and smoking tar contents, nicotine contents. With the source fingerprint of PAHs in tobacco smoke, NA could be regarded as the marker of tobacco smoke source because of its largest contribution to summation operator PAHs (40.2%), followed by FLUOR (12.7%) and ACY (9.8%). Further study indicated that more than 80% of BaP in indoor air of resident homes in Hangzhou was from tobacco smoke. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

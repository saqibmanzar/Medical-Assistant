Safrole is formerly used as a food flavour It is a precursor in the synthesis of the insecticide synergist piperonyl butoxide and the recreational drug MDMA (Ecstacy). Safrole is a natural plant constituent, found in oil of sassafras and certain other essential oils. It is a member of the methylenedioxybenzene group of compounds, many of which (e.g. piperonyl butoxide) are extensively used as insecticide synergists. Safrole is a major source of human exposure to safrole is through consumption of spices, such as nutmeg, cinnamon and black pepper, in which safrole is a constituent. Safrole is also present in root beer, and has been used as an additive in chewing gum, toothpaste, soaps and certain pharmaceutical preparations. Safrole is a weak hepatocarcinogen and it is a matter of considerable interest whether the ally1 moiety or the methylenedioxy group, or both, are involved in the mechanism of its carcinogenesis. Safrole is extensively metabolized, giving rise to a large number of metabolites. Metabolism involves essentially two major routes, oxidation of the ally1 side chain, and oxidation of the methylenedioxy group with subsequent cleavage to form the catechol. Safrole undergoes oxidation of the allylic group to yield the 2, 3-epoxide (safrole epoxide). The dihydrodiol is one of the metabolites of safrole, and presumably arises from the hydration of the 2, 3-epoxide. The principal route of metabolism of safrole is through cleavage of the methylenedioxy group, the major metabolites being allylcatechol and its isomer, propenylcatechol. Eugenol and its isomer I-methoxy- 2-hydroxy-4-allylbenzene have been detected as minor metabolites in the rat, mouse and man. ; Safrole, also known as shikimol, is a colorless or slightly yellow oily liquid. It is typically extracted from the root-bark or the fruit of sassafras plants in the form of sassafras oil, or synthesized from other related methylenedioxy compounds. It is the principal component of brown camphor oil, and is found in small amounts in a wide variety of plants, where it functions as a natural pesticide. The Ocotea cymbarum[verification needed] oil made of the Ocotea pretiosa[verification needed], a plant growing in Brazil, and sassafras oil made of Sassafras albidum, a tree growing in eastern North America, are the main natural sources for safrole. It has a characteristic candy-shop aroma. Safrole has been shown to exhibit antibiotic and anti-angiogenic functions  (A3314, A3315, A3316).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The mice were killed 24 hr after treatment and the fetuses were removed and prepared for tissue isolation. A sensitive (32)P-postlabeling method was used to study the binding of safrole to the DNA of various maternal and fetal tissues. The results showed that safrole bound to the DNA of maternal and fetal liver, lung, kidney, heart, brain, intestine, skin, maternal uterus and placenta, and the quantitative and qualitative differences in binding were organ-specific. The covalent binding index (umol adducted nucleotides per molecule of DNA nucleotides/umol carcinogen administered per g body weight) 24 hr after safrole treatment, ranged from 0.1 to 247 and 0.1 to 5.8 for maternal and fetal DNA, respectively. In both maternal and fetal tissues, safrole exhibited preferential binding to liver DNA, with brain DNA the least affected. Autoradiography fingerprints derived from maternal and fetal organs revealed DNA adduct spots that were identified as several metabolites of safrole. Fetal adduct levels were lower than maternal, exhibiting the greatest difference (42-fold) in liver, but little difference in lung, brain, and intestines.",

Timed pregnant mice or monkeys were given a single dose of carcinogen on different gestation days, sacrificed 1-50 days later, and analyzed for DNA adducts by (32)P post labeling assay. The following results were obtained. The chemical types of carcinogen determine the fetal and fetal/maternal adduct levels and whether there is a gestation stage dependency in DNA binding. ... Safrole preferentially bound to fetal liver (as for adults) with strong gestation stage specificity. ... All carcinogens tested bound ubiquitously to all fetal and possible embryonic DNA with levels exhibiting little relationship to placental levels. Fetal adduct levels varied from 0.05-2 fold of maternal levels depending on the carcinogen tested. Thus, fetal competence in metabolism of a specific carcinogen is a determining factor for transplacental DNA damage. Placental adduct levels are a qualitative, but not a quantitative, indicator of fetal exposure.",

It was postulated that these effects could be attributable to metabolic formation of amphetamine derivatives from the main nutmeg ingredients elemicin (EL), myristicin (MY), and safrole (SA). In a case of a suspected nutmeg abuse, neither such amphetamine derivatives nor the main nutmeg ingredients could be detected in urine. The metabolites of EL, MY, and SA were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in rat urine and their presence in human urine of the nutmeg abuser was confirmed. The identified metabolites indicated that EL, MY, and SA were once and twice hydroxylated at the side chain. In addition, EL was O-demethylated at 2 positions followed by side chain hydroxylation. MY and SA were demethylenated and subsequently methylated. In the human urine sample, the following metabolites could be identified: O-demethyl elemicin, O-demethyl dihydroxy elemicin, demethylenyl myristicin, dihydroxy myristicin, and demethylenyl safrole. As in the human urine sample, neither amphetamine derivatives nor the main nutmeg ingredients could be detected in the rat urine samples. Finally, toxicologic detection of nutmeg abuse was possible by identification of the described metabolites of the EL, MY, and SA in urine applying the authors' systematic toxicologic analysis procedure using full-scan gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after acid hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction of analytes, and microwave-assisted acetylation of extracted analytes.",

The space between primary & secondary container should be filled with absorbent material, which would withstand chem attack from the carcinogen & is sufficient to absorb the entire contents of the primary container in the event of breakage or leakage. Each secondary container should then be enclosed in a strong outer box. The space between the secondary container & the outer box should be filled with an appropriate quantity of shock-absorbent material. Sender should use fastest & most secure form of transport & notify recipient of its departure.

Safrole is a major chemical constituent of aromatic oil present in sassafras root bark. According to FDA, safrole and safrole-containing products cannot be recognized as being safe for human use. Oil of sassafras containing safrole was formerly used as flavoring agent in soft drinks. Safrole is the main precursor for producing the amphetamine-type stimulant drug, N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDMA), also known as ecstasy. HUMAN STUDIES: A maximization test (Kligman) was carried out on 25 volunteers. The material was tested at a concentration of 8% in petrolatum and produced no sensitization reactions. Safrole-DNA adducts were detected in in tissue specimens from esophageal cancer patients with a history of habitual areca chewing. Similarly, the presence of safrole-DNA adduct was demonstrated in two out of 28 hepatic tissues from hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and only these two patients had a history of betel quid chewing lasting more than 10 years. Safrole was a potent inhibitor of human CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and CYP2E1. With relatively less potency, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were also inhibited. ANIMAL STUDIES: Safrole applied at full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was moderately irritating. Applied undiluted to the backs of hairless mice, it was not irritating. In a feeding study in dogs, groups of 2 males and 2 females fed 5 or 20 mg safrole/kg/day for 6 years showed liver enlargement, fatty change, minimal focal necrosis, mild post-necrotic cirrhosis, bile duct and Kupffer cell proliferation, hepatic cell atrophy and leucocytic infiltration. Similar liver changes were seen with higher doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg/day given over much shorter periods of 91-116 and 26-39 days, respectively. Dietary administration of safrole caused hepatocellular carcinoma in male mice and benign or malignant liver tumors (hepatocellular carcinoma or adenoma or cholangiocarcinoma) in rats of both sexes. Hepatocellular carcinoma was also observed in mice of both sexes administered safrole by stomach tube from 7 to 28 days of age, followed by dietary exposure for up to 82 weeks, and in infant male mice administered safrole by sc injection. The incidence of liver tumors (adenoma and carcinoma) was increased in male mice exposed during infancy via milk and in adult female mice administered safrole in the diet. Safrole did not increase sister chromatid exchange frequency in cultured Chinese hamster cells. Safrole was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA 100 at concentration of 10 and 25 ug/mL. Safrole showed positive results in the absence of metabolic activation when its mutagenicity was determined with DNA repair-deficient Escherichia coli rec- strains. Hepatic safrole-DNA adduct were detected in mice that were treated with safrole. In pregnant mice, safrole was bound to the DNA of maternal and fetal liver, lung, kidney, heart, brain, intestine, skin, maternal uterus and placenta. Fetal adduct levels were lower than maternal, exhibiting the greatest difference (42-fold) in liver, but little difference in lung, brain, and intestines.",

However, no studies are available to elucidate the mechanisms of how areca induces carcinogenesis in the esophagus. Since the areca nut in Taiwan contains a high concentration of safrole, a well-known carcinogenic agent, we analyzed safrole-DNA adducts by the (32)P-postlabelling method in tissue specimens from esophageal cancer patients. In total, we evaluated 47 patients with esophageal cancer (16 areca chewers and 31 non-chewers) who underwent esophagectomy at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1996 and 2002. Of the individuals with a history of habitual areca chewing (14 cigarette smokers and two non-smokers), one of the tumor tissue samples and five of the normal esophageal mucosa samples were positive for safrole-DNA adducts. All patients positive for safrole-DNA adducts were also cigarette smokers. Such adducts could not be found in patients who did not chew areca, irrespective of their habits of alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking (p<0.001, comparing the areca chewers with non-chewers). ...",

Safrole's former production and use as a flavoring agent in foods, drugs, and beverages, may have resulted in its release to the environment through various waste streams. Safrole is a constituent of several essential oils such as nutmeg, mace, ginger, cinnamon and black pepper. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0706 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates safrole will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase safrole will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 5 and 23 hrs, respectively. Safrole contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, safrole is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 210. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.1X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Safrole has a vapor pressure of 0.0706 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, safrole may volatilize from dry soil. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, safrole is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 and 42 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 86 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to safrole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where safrole is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to safrole via ingestion of foods naturally containing safrole and dermal contact with consumer products containing safrole and from smoking cigarettes.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The dye soln were analyzed at 30 deg by reversed phase chromatography on an HP:RP-8, 10 um MOS Hypersil column using a mobile phase of MeOH-H2O at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with UV detection. Responses were linear for 0.1-10 ug/ml Rhodamine B and Erio Acid Red, whereas the range was 1.0-10 ug/ml for Automate Red B. The limits of detection were 0.1 ug/ml for Rhodamine B and Erio Acid Red, and 1 ug/ml for Automate Red B. The method was successfully used to quantify Rhodamine B and Erio Acid Red present in two aq formulations of fenitrothion insecticide. However, interference peaks were observed with the oil-based formulation and prevented the quantification of Automate Red B present.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

This includes copious irrigation, mechanical removal of particles, and in the case of imbedded colored pencil may necessitate surgical exploration and careful removal of the particles. Solutions of tannin or tannic acid precipitate cationic dyes and render them essentially noninjurious, but this disposes of only that portion of the dye which has not already reacted with the tissues. /It was/ determined experimentally that a 5% to 10% solution of tannin was effective essentially in a prophylactic sense if applied within three minutes following application of powdered basic dyes to the eyes of rabbits, but that the effectiveness of this treatment rapidly diminished after three minutes. Other forms of chemical treatment have been aimed at removing both combined and excess dye. However, studies of the reaction of cationic dyes with cornea in vitro have shown these dyes to bind very tenaciously and to be very difficult to remove from combination with the tissue. ... /Cationic dyes/",

Chest x-rays demonstrated no acute pulmonary pathology. All of the patients had resolution of their symptoms within 24 hours of exposure, with 63 percent reporting resolution within 4 hours.

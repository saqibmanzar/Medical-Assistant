PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear a full facepiece, self-contained breathing apparatus. While bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane must be preheated before ignition can occur, when heated to decomposition it emits toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid. For fires involving this substance, extinguish with dry chemical or CO2. Also, water fog gently applied to the surface of the liquid will cause a frothing which will extinguish the fire. This substance should be stored in cool, well-ventilated areas, away from direct rays of the sun, fire hazards, moisture, acids, and other oxidizing materials. Bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane is a potential candidate for disposal by fluidized bed, rotary kiln, or liquid injection forms of incineration.",

However, if the victim is conscious and not convulsing and if medical help is not readily available, consider the risk of inducing vomiting because of the high toxicity of the chemical ingested. Ipecac syrup or salt water may be used in such an emergency. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. If the victim is convulsing or unconscious, do not give anything by mouth, ensure that the victim's airway is open and lay the victim on his/her side with the head lower than the body. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. IMMEDIATELY transport the victim to a hospital. (NTP, 1992)",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.132 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.1 days. If released to soil, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 32. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane is not expected to readily biodegrade in the environment; bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane underwent 0% biodegradation using a settled domestic wastewater inoculum and biodegradation remained at 0% through three subcultures. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8.4 and 96 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 4 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The estimated hydrolysis half-life of bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane was reported as 0.5 to 2 years (pH independent), based on analogy to similar beta-chloro ethers. Occupational exposure to bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.132 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 7,800 mg/l(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8.4 and 96 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 4(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The hydrolysis half-life for similar beta-chloro ethers has been estimated at 0.5-2 years, a process which is pH independent(7). Bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane is not expected to readily biodegrade in the environment(SRC); bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane underwent 0% biodegradation using a settled domestic wastewater inoculum and biodegradation remained at 0% through three subcultures(8,9).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

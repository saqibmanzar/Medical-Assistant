Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Chickens were administered monocrotaline after separate groups were pretreated with BHA and 2-chloroethanol. There was an apparent deleterious effect of monocrotaline in 2-chloroethanol-pretreated chickens, similar to that in non-pretreated birds, with respect to growth rates, morbility, mortality, and hepatic histopatholoqy. Monocrotaline pyrrole formation was measured in chickens pretread with BHA and 2-chloroethanol by means of the Erlich reagent reaction spectrophotometric assay. There was a significant difference in pyrrole production between the treatment groups. The 2-chloroethanol plus-monocrotaline (40 mg/kg), BHA (500 mg/kg) plus monocrotaline, nonocrotaline, BHA (100 mg/kg) plus monocrotaline (20 mg/kg), and BHA (500 mg/kg) plus 2-chloroethanol and monocrotaline groups had decreasing amounts of pyrrole metabolite formation respectively.",

Ethylene chlorohydrin (0, 60 or 120 mg/kg/day, intravenous) in 5% dextrose was administered daily in a volume of 1 mL/kg of body weight on gestational days (gd) 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 or 10-12. Plug-positive females were matched by body weight across treatment groups prior to the initiation of dosing and weighed daily during treatment. At sacrifice on gd 17 a total of 34-54 dams (i.e., confirmed-pregnant females) per treatment group from each exposure period were evaluated. The gravid uterus of each dam was weighed and the number of implantation sites and live, dead or resorbed fetuses were recorded. All live fetuses were weighed, sexed and examined for external, visceral and skeletal malformations. Administration of the low dose of ethylene chlorohydrin (60 mg/kg/day) did not result in any statistically significant expression of maternal toxicity, regardless of the period of administration. Evidence of embryotoxicity in the low-dose group was observed only following exposure to ethylene chlorohydrin on gd 8-10, a treatment which significantly decreased the average fetal body weight per litter. No statistically significant change in the incidence of malformed fetuses per litter was observed for any exposure period at the low dose. Administration of the high dose of ethylene chlorohydrin (120 mg/kg/day) resulted in mortality rates of 0%, 8%, 12.3% and 15.6% among plug-positive females treated on estational days 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 and 10-12, respectively. The high-dose group also exhibited a significant dose-related reduction in maternal weight gain during treatment for each of the exposure periods. In addition, dams treated on estational days 8-10 or 10-12 showed decreased gestational weight gain, as well as decreased gravid uterine weight, but no decrease in absolute maternal weight gain. Ethylene chlorohydrin (120 mg/kg/day) produced dose-related signs of embryotoxicity including a significant reduction in average fetal body weight per litter for each exposure period. Litters from females exposed to the high dose on estational days 4-6, 8-10 or 10-12 also exhibited a significant increase in the percentage per litter of resorbed, nonlive and affected fetuses. A significant increase in the percentage of malformed fetuses per litter was observed in only one exposure group (i.e., ethylene chlorohydrin, 120 mg/kg/day on estational days 8-10) which exhibited 2.3% malformed fetuses per litter as compared to 0.2% malformed fetuses per litter for the vehicle control group. Further examination of the data indicated that this effect was statistically significant only for one of four study replicates, in which the mortality rate for treated females was 46.7%. In conclusion, ethylene chlorohydrin (0, 60 or 120 mg/kg/day) administered to timed pregnant CD-l mice on estational days 4-6, 6-8, 8-10 or 10-12 was associated in a dose-related manner with maternal and fetal toxicity (reduced body weight). An increase in the incidence of malformed fetuses was seen only at one exposure period (gd 8-10) and at a dose of ethylene chlorohydrin (120 mg/kg/day) which was associated with increased maternal mortality.",

Ethylene Chlorohydrin in 5% dextrose was administered daily in a volume of 0.3 ml/kg of body weight on gd 6 through 14 at dosages of 0, 9, 18 or 36 mg/kg/day, intravenous. An untreated control group was also included in the study. Females were weighed and observed daily during treatment for clinical signs of toxicity. At sacrifice on gestational day 30, a total of 15 to 21 dams (i.e., confirmed-pregnant females) per treatment group were evaluated. ... Administration of ethylene Chlorohydrin (0, 9, 18 or 36 mg/kg/day, intravenous) on gestational day 6- 14 resulted in mortality rates of 4.3% (1/23), 5.2% (1/19), 13.6% (3/22) and 15.0% (3/20) for the vehicle control through high-dose groups, respectively. No unscheduled deaths occurred among 17 untreated females. Clinical signs observed in the ethylene Chlorohydrin (0, 9, 18 or 36 mg/kg/day) groups included hyperactivity, lacrimation and diarrhea, but no apparent relation to dose was observed. Measures of maternal body weight (gestational day 0, 6, 10, 14 and 30), maternal weight gain (i.e., weight gain during gestation, weight gain during treatment and absolute weight gain), gravid uterine weight and maternal liver weight were not found to differ statistically among treatment groups. Examination of uterine contents on gd 30 revealed no differences among groups in the percentage of resorbed, dead, nonlive (i.e., dead plus resorbed) or affected (i.e., nonlive plus malformed) fetuses per litter. Nor were average live litter size, percentage of males per litter or average fetal body weight per litter altered by ethylene Chlorohydrin treatment. No evidence of a treatment-related teratogenic effect was observed, even at the highest dose. In conclusion, no evidence was observed for a fetotoxic or teratogenic effect of ethylene Chlorohydrin (0, 9, 18 or 36 mg/kg/day, intravenous) administered to NZW rabbits on gd 6-14.",

Formerly 2-chloroethanol was a major industrial precursor for ethylene oxide. However, this process for manufacturing ethylene oxide has been almost entirely supplanted. It is also formed during the fumigation of foodstuffs with ethylene oxide. If released on soil, 2-chloroethanol would be expected to leach because of its estimated very low adsorptivity to soil and may biodegrade. It should not volatilize from moist soil, but may evaporate from dry soil and other surfaces. 2- Chloroethanol's fate in the aquatic environment is not clear. Based on data from screening tests, it may biodegrade. It would not be expected to volatilize from surface waters, adsorb to sediment or bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. 2-Chloroethanol reacts with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere, as a result of which its half-life in the atmosphere will be approximately 11.5 days. 2-Chloroethanol is soluble in water and would be washed out of the air by rain. Occupational exposure to 2- chloroethanol would be via inhalation and dermal contact. The general population may be exposed via ingestion of food containing residues of 2- chloroethanol. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In view of its low Henry's Law constant and low estimated adsorptivity to soil, volatilization from moist soil should be negligible(2). 2-Chloroethanol's vapor pressure is 7.18 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3) and therefore it should readily volatilize from dry soil and other surfaces.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

It was left in the drier after heating had been discontinued (though cooling was not applied) and air had been allowed in, to await discharge the next working day. After 2 hr, a violent explosion occurred. Later investigation of the stability of the compound, notably by accelerating rate calorimetry techniques, showed that the excessively long drying time had probably caused the onset of thermal decomposition while heat was still being applied, and that further storage under virtually adiabatic conditions would have led to the steady acceleration of the exothermic decomposition to the point of explosion. At this point, it was estimated that a temperature in excess of 800 \u00b0C had been attained in the drier at detonation, when the shock wave would generate a pressure approaching 800 bar. Differential scanning calorimetry techniques had shown exotherms at 273 \u00b0C for unheated material, and of 248-259 for material which had been preheated using conditions thought to be present in the drier. The finely powdered amide is also a significant dust explosion hazard, maximum explosion pressures of 10.4 bar and maximum rate of rise above 680 bar/second having been determined."

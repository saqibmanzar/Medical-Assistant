PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The reaction generally starts at elevated temperatures and proceeds exothermically. The second step is the conversion of the monoester to a diester with the formation of water. This is a reversible reaction and proceeds more slowly than the first, thus determining the overall rate of reaction. To shift the equilibrium towards the diester, the water of reaction is removed by distillation. The rate of reaction can be influenced by the choice of catalyst and the reaction temperature. For fast conversion rates, high reaction temperatures are generally used. However, these are influenced by the boiling point of the alcohol and/or the type of catalyst. ... Currently, nearly all major phthalate producers use amphoteric catalysts for the esterification of high boiling alcohols. ... The reaction temperatures for the amphoteric catalysts are about 200 \u00b0C. At this temperature side reactions are minimized, and the alcohol can be recycled without purification. By using this type of catalyst, over 99.5 % conversion to diester can be achieved. /Phthalates/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.9X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates octyl decyl phthalate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase octyl decyl phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Particulate-phase octyl decyl phthalate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Octyl decyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, octyl decyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6.6X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation data were not available; however, biodegradation studies on a series of phthalate esters have demonstrated that phthalate esters in general are readily biodegraded. If released into water, octyl decyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.6 and 47 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 260 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 7.7 years and 280 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to octyl decyl phthalate may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where octyl decyl phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to octyl decyl phthalate via dermal contact with consumer products containing octyl decyl phthalate. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.6 and 47 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column.  The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 260 years if adsorption is considered (5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 9.52(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 47 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 260 years when adsorption is considered(3). Octyl decyl phthalate's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

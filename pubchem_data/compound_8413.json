ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Hemoglobin adducts were hydrolyzed under alkaline conditions, and the arylamines analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. With benzidine, three cleavage products were observed, the major component being monoacetylbenzidine. This indicates that 4-nitroso-4'-N- acetylaminobiphenyl is the major reactive metabolite in erythrocytes. In addition benzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl were identified. With 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine and 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine two cleavage products were observed, the parent diamines being present in excess to or in amounts comparable to the monoacetyl derivative. With 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine a hemoglobin adduct could not be found. When the azo dye direct red 28 was administered to the animals, the three cleavage products typical for benzidine were found, indicating that benzidine became bioavailable after reductive cleavage of the azo compound. In this case the fraction of 4-aminobiphenyl was greater than after benzidine. It is proposed to use the analysis of hemoglobin adducts in human blood to control the exposure of individuals to these carcinogenic chemicals in the course of biochemical effect monitoring.",

A comparison of the amount of deoxyribonucleic acid repair induced in rat and hamster hepatocytes by 7 azo dyes and 17 aromatic amine azo reduction products of the dyes was performed using the primary hepatocyte culture/deoxyribonucleic acid repair assay. Congo Red & its azo reduction product, benzidine, were more potent inducers of deoxyribonucleic acid repair in hamster than in rat hepatocytes, whereas Trypan Blue and its reduction product, o-tolidine, were equipotent in the 2 hepatocyte systems. Evans Blue, another o-Tolidine-based dye, elicited a greater deoxyribonucleic acid repair response in hamster hepatocytes. The absolute potency of these dyes, however, was much less than their reduction products. These findings extend previous observations of the superior metabolic activation capabilities of hamster, relative to rat hepatocytes.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In the current investigation, nine other dyes structurally related to Congo red were examined for developmental testicular toxicity. In this study, the structural component of the dyes responsible for the prenatal induction of germ cell aplasia was identified. /Investigators/ found that only benzidine-based dyes altered testicular development and caused hypospermatogenesis in mice during adulthood. Dimethyl- and dimethoxybenzidine-based dyes were without effect. Pregnant mice were dosed orally on Days 8-12 of gestation with a benzidine-, dimethylbenzidine-, or a dimethoxybenzidine-based dye and the testes of 45- to 50-day-old male offspring were examined. The testes of postpubertal male offspring exposed to the benzidine-based dyes, Congo red, diamine blue, and Chlorazol Black E, were small and contained some tubules completely devoid of germ cells, but the dimethylbenzidine-based dyes, trypan blue, Evans blue, and benzopurpurin 4B, and the dimethoxybenzidine-based dye, Chicago sky blue, did not alter testicular development in this manner. Azoic diazo component 48, a dimethoxybenzidine congener, and two other diazo dyes, naphthol blue black and Sudan III, were also without effect on the germ cells. Experiments with Chlorazol Black E (CBE) indicate that the period of susceptibility in the male fetus is limited to the period of primordial germ cell migration and division. When CBE was administered on Days 8-10 of gestation it reduced testis weight after puberty by 30%, while treatment after Day 13 did not affect testicular function.",

This is accompanied by the induction of activities of individual isoforms of the multifunctional family of glutathione-S-transferases. There was a decrease in the glutathione peroxidase activity after intoxication with benzidine derivatives. It was found that the GSH content in rat liver decreased after benzidine intoxication and sharply increased after effects of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine and 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine. In all cases studied there was a diminution in the level of diene conjugates. It was supposed that the specificity of the catalytic glutathione redox system reaction is due to structural peculiarities of the aminobiphenyls being injected. Analysis of functional pairs of glutathione-dependent enzymes revealed a certain imbalance in the antioxidant system function after aminobiphenyl poisoning.",

These commercially used dyes are metabolically degraded to DMO or DM in the intestinal tract of rodents and subsequently DMO and DM are absorbed into the blood stream. Animals were exposed to DMO, DM, or the dyes in the drinking water. Tumors obtained from control and chemical-treated animals were examined for the presence of activated oncogenes by the NIH 3T3 DNA transfection assay. Activated oncogenes were detected in less than 3% (1/38) of the tumors from control animals whereas 68% (34/50) of the tumors from chemical-treated animals contained detectable oncogenes. Activated oncogenes were detected in both malignant (25/36) and benign (9/14) tumors from the chemically treated animals but only in one of 13 malignant tumors from the control animals. The presence of oncogenes in the chemically induced benign tumors suggests that oncogene activation was an early event in those tumors. Southern blot analysis of transfectant DNA showed that the transforming properties of the chemically induced rat tumor DNAs were due to the transfer of an activated H-ras (31/34) or N-ras (3/34) gene. One spontaneous rat tumor DNA was found to contain an activated H-ras gene. Oligonucleotide hybridization analysis indicated that the H-ras oncogenes from chemical-associated tumors contained mutations at codons 12, 13, or 61 whereas the spontaneously activated H-ras gene contained a point mutation at codon 61. These data suggest that activation of cellular ras genes by point mutation is an important step in the induction of tumors, at least in rats, by this class of benzidine-derived dyes. Moreover, in light of common histogenesis of the normal counterparts of many of the chemically induced neoplasms and histological evidence of varied tissue differentiation in some basal cell neoplasms, it is possible that most or all of the chemically induced neoplasms were derived from a common epidermal progenitor stem cell population.",

This reaction of practical significance for analytical tests was studied by optical and ESR spectroscopy. For the blue dye formed in aqueous solution a meriquinoidic structure was proposed which is in equilibrium with an instable radical compound. This equilibrium is shifted to higher radical concentrations by ethylene glycol. Naphthene derivatives stabilize the meriquinoidic structure by means of non-covalent interactions resulting in a decrease of the radical concentration. In crosslinked gelatin the dye formation runs analogously, so that this system is suitable for providing evidence for H2O2-forming reactions. Naphthene derivatives substituted by sufficiently long aliphatic groups are diffusion stable in crosslinked gelatin. By interacting with the dye they prevent its rapid chemical decomposition and diffusion into the sample solution. It was shown, furthermore, that by means of such systems with a suitable structure of the layers both substrates and enzymes participating in the reaction may be determined analytically. This does provide a basis for developing new analytical test variants.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Negative results were also obtained at dietary level of 0.3%, which was highest tolerated level. Commercial o-Tolidine in olive oil was given as a weekly SC injection, at a dose level of 60 mg/rat/wk (total dose: 5.5 g), to 105 sherman rats. Survived more than 300 days and were kept throughout their lifespan. In contrast to rats given benzidine, no cirrhosis or hepatomas were observed among those receiving o-Tolidine. Rats developed cancer of external auditory canal, all tumors appearing after 354th day. No control group was run at the same time. Out of 56 tumors occurring among 578 untreated rats of the same colony, none was located in the external auditory canal.",

The 14-month exposures were planned as 24-month exposures but were terminated early because of rapidly declining animal survival, due primarily to neoplasia. The average amount of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride consumed per day was approximately 1.8, 4.0, or 11.2 mg/kg for low-, mid-, or high-dose male rats and 3.0, 6.9, or 12.9 mg/kg for low-, mid-, or high-dose female rats. ... Because of extensive neoplasia, many exposed males and females were dying or were sacrificed moribund in the first year, and all high-dose males died by week 55. The studies were terminated at weeks 60 to 61, at which time the group survivals were male; control, 60/60; low dose, 41/45; mid dose, 50/75; high dose, 0/60; female: 59/60; 39/45; 27/75; high dose, 0/60; female: 59/60; 39/45; 32/75; 10/60. ... There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride for male F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant neoplasms of the skin, Zymbal's gland, preputial gland, liver, oral cavity, small and large intestine, lung, and mesothelium. Increased incidences of neoplasms of the brain may have been related to chemical administration.

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.0X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine will exist in both the vapor and particulate in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours. Particulate-phase 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine absorbs at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3200. The pKa values of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine are 4.50 and 3.3, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Stronger adsorption of protonated 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine has been observed in sorption studies. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 3% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine is not readily biodegradable. Benzidine and its derivatives are known to be rapidly oxidized by Fe(III) and other cations which are frequently found in soil and environmental waters. If released into water, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. BCF values in the range of 4.8 to 83, measured in fish, suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate. 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis due to a lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Direct photolysis and photo-oxidation may be important fate processes in natural waters exposed to sunlight. Occupational exposure to 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine is produced or used. (SRC)",

The pKa values of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine are 4.50 and 3.3(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). In sediment studies, sorption measurements over the pH range of 5 to 9 saw an increase in sorption as the pH decreased suggesting that the protonated form of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine was more strongly bound than the neutral form(5). Volatilization of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(2). 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.0X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(2). 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine, present at 100 mg/L, reached 3% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(6), indicating the compound is not readily biodegradable(6). 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine absorbs light >290 nm(7) and may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight on soil surfaces(SRC). Benzidine is rapidly oxidized by Fe(III) and several other cations which are frequently found in environmental soils and clays(8) which suggest that 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine may also be degraded by a similar process(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.3X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values in the range of 4.8 to 83(4), measured in carp (Cyprinus carpio), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to moderate(SRC). 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine, present at 100 mg/L, reached 3% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L and the Japanese MITI test(6), indicating the compound is not readily biodegradable(5). 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine absorbs light >290 nm(6) and may be susceptible to direct photolysis. When aerated solutions of benzidine were exposed to a light from a xenon lamp (300-400 nm) complete degradation of benzidine was observed in 12 hours(7); photodegradation of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine may be similar(SRC). Aromatic amines are susceptible to photooxidation in natural waters via reaction with OH and RO2 radicals with half-lives on the order of a few days or less(8), therefore, photooxidation may be an important fate process for 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine in sunlit natural water(SRC). Benzidine is rapidly oxidized by Fe(III) and several other cations which are frequently found in environmental soils and clays(9) which suggests that 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine may also be degraded by a similar process(SRC). 3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis due to a lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(2), this estimated Koc value suggests that 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine is expected to have slight mobility in soil. The pKa value of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine are 4.50 and 3.3(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). In sorption studies using colloidal sediment collected from the Chesapeake Bay estuary, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine had a colloid Koc value (Kcoll) of 2014(5); sorption measurements over the pH range of 5 to 9 saw a significant increase in sorption as the pH decreased suggesting that the protonated form of 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine was more strongly bound than the neutral form(5).",

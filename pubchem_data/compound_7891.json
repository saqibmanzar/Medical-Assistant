When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 34.6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-bromo-3-methylbutane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-bromo-3-methylbutane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. If released to soil, 1-bromo-3-methylbutane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 240. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.46X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of 1-bromo-3-methylbutane from dry soil surfaces exists based upon its vapor pressure. No biodegradation data were located for 1-bromo-3-methylbutane. If released into water, 1-bromo-3-methylbutane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 5 days, respectively. 1-Bromo-3-methylbutane is an alkyl halide which is susceptible to hydrolysis; however the rate of this reaction has not been measured. The hydrolysis half-life of an analogous compound, 1-bromopropane, is about 26 days at pH 7, which suggests 1-bromo-3-methylbutane may undergo hydrolysis. An estimated BCF of 32 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to 1-bromo-3-methylbutane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-bromo-3-methylbutane is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.46X10-2 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1 hour and 5 days, respectively (SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 32(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). 1-Bromo-3-methylbutane is an alkyl halide which is susceptible to hydrolysis(6). No measured hydrolysis rates were located for this compound. However, the hydrolysis half-life of an analogous compound, 1-bromopropane, is about 26 days at pH 7(7), which suggests 1-bromo-3-methylbutane may undergo hydrolysis(SRC).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 5 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). 1-Bromo-3-methylbutane is not expected to undergo direct photolysis in the environment since it does not contain functional groups that absorb light in the environmental UV spectrum(SRC). Alkyl halides are susceptible to hydrolysis in the environment(2,3); however, no measured hydrolysis rates were located for this compound. The hydrolysis half-life of an analogous compound, 1-bromopropane, is about 26 days at pH 7(4), which suggests 1-bromo-3-methylbutane may also hydrolyze(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

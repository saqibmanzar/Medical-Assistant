When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Parent animals in the test and control vessels had to be pipetted 3 times/wk in freshly prepared test and control media at the corresponding concn level. The no observed effect concn (NOEC) was determined from the parameters of mortality of the parent animals, reproduction rate and appearance of the first offspring during the test period. In preliminary acute Daphnia tests, the 24-hr EC50 was 286 mg/l for ethyl propionate, the EC0 was 173 mg/l. The nominal 21-day no observed effect concn was 6.3 mg/l, with the most sensitive parameter being parental mortality.",

Ethyl propionate is a common volatile found in fresh citrus fruits and juices, some whiskeys, and in Parna ham. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 35.8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl propionate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl propionate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days. If released to soil, ethyl propionate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 12. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation in soil and water is expected to be an important environmental fate process because of the presence of an easily biodegraded ester functional group. Ethyl propionate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, ethyl propionate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hrs and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 1.7 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated aqueous hydrolysis half-lives of 2.5 years and 90 days have been calculated at pH 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ethyl propionate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl propionate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to ethyl propionate via ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other consumer products containing ethyl propionate. Ethyl propionate is a common volatile found in fresh citrus fruits and juices. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The dimers thiram (TMTD), disulfiram (TETD), and tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM) inhibited ADH more than the metal containing dithiocarbamates zineb and maneb or the monomer salts dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDC), diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDC) and ziram using either ethanol or NAD as the main substrate. The /data suggests/ that the risk of a delayed ethanol elimination from mammalian blood by zineb or maneb may be very low since high concentrations of 1 uM/l or 0.1 uM/l showed weak inhibitory actions of ADH. The actions on the aldehyde binding site of the studied compounds were similar to those on the NAD binding site. TMTD, TETD and TMTM inhibited ALDH in both cases when acetaldehyde was the main substrate or when NAD was the main substrate. Zineb and maneb initiated a less pronounced alteration of ALDH activity while the monomers DMDC, DEDC, ziram were ineffective. A comparison of ADH inhibition with that of ALDH showed that ALDH was affected by the dithiocarbamates at a concentration which was about ten fold lower than the concentration affecting ADH. The /data/ suggest that at higher dithiocarbamate concentrations more S-S bridges may be formed which cause aggregation resulting in enzyme inactivation. DMDC or DEDC may abstract the active zinc from the ADH molecule by complex binding and may thus cause enzyme inactivation.",

This effect was enhanced by increasing the dose to 867 mg/kg orally and was associated with a lengthening of the zoxazolamine paralysis time. Both effects were causally related to an inhibition of the microsomal monooxygenases. One reason for this inhibition was the concomitant decrease in the conversion of palmitic acid (incorporation of (14)C radioactivity) into the phospholipids of the microsomal membrane. Other clinicochemical parameters of liver function detectable in the blood remained normal even after oral doses of 26 mg/kg TMTM administered on 5 consecutive days/wk over 4 wk. This treatment caused a decrease in the erythrocyte count and Hb content in the blood together with a reduction of the relative liver weight, body and the intake of food while the consumption of drinking water was increased. Histologically there was evidence of hepatocellular and renal tubular swelling. In female mice given acute oral doses of TMTM, the LD50 was calculated as 818 (583-995) mg/kg. In mutagenicity tests, TMTM caused point mutations in strains TA 100 and TA 1535 (Salmonella typhimurium LT 2). The toxic potential of TMTM was comparable to that of other thiurams. ...",

If released to the atmosphere, bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere based on an estimated vapor pressure of 2.7X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 3 hours. Particulate-phase bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 10 suggests that bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide will have very high mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur because of the moderate Henry's Law constant. Based on data for a similar compound, the disulfide (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide is expected to be resistant to aerobic biodegradation in soil and water; over a 4 week period, tetramethylthiuram disulfide (at 100 mg/L, sewage inoculum) reached 2.8% of the theoretical BOD. Bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide, as a powdered additive placed onto a membrane or resin support and buried in soil, did not support microbial growth over a 3 month period. Bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide will volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 28 days, respectively. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is unlikely based on an estimated BCF value of 2. Exposure to bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide may occur occupationally during its production or use in the manufacture of other products. (SRC)",

Based on data for a similar compound, the disulfide (tetramethylthiuram disulfide), bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide is expected to be resistant to aerobic biodegradation(SRC); over a 4 week period, tetramethylthiuram disulfide (at 100 mg/L, sewage inoculum) reached 2.8% of the theoretical BOD(3). Bis(dimethylthiocarbamoyl) sulfide may volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 28 days, respectively(5,SRC). An estimated BCF value of 2(5,SRC), from an estimated log Kow(6,SRC), suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC), according to a recommended classification scheme(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

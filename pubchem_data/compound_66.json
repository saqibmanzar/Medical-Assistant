ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Exposure to this crystalline substance may occur from its use as a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of dicamba. Toxic by all routes (ie, ingestion, inhalation, skin contact), effects from exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol can include burning of the skin, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, cyanosis, shock, and death from cardiac or respiratory failure. Personnel handling 2,5-dichlorophenol should wear protective clothing, gloves, boots and goggles to prevent skin contact, and an approved dust respirator. In an emergency situations, wear self-contained breathing apparatus and structural firefighter's protective clothing. Remove and isolate contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. In case of contact with 2,5-dichlorophenol, immdeiately flush skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes and wash skin with concentrated soap solution. 2,5-Dichlorophenol does not ignite readily, but it can burn, producing irritating and poisonous gases. For small fires involving 2,5-dichlorophenol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, or standard foam, and for large fires, use water spray, fog, or standard foam. Runoff from fire control water may cause pollution. 2,5-Dichlorophenol may be shipped via air, rail, road, or water in containers bearing the label, \"Keep away from food.\" Small spills of 2,5-dichlorophenol solution may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed in closed containers for later disposal. Large spills of 2,5-dichlorophenol (solution) should be contained in pits, or other holding areas that are sealed with an impermeable flexible membrane liner. Runoff should be controlled by diking. Solids should be covered with a plastic sheet. Spills of 2,5-dichlorophenol in water may be trapped at the bottom with sand bag barriers, activated charcoal applied, and trapped material removed with suction hoses, mechanical dredges, or lifts. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

Prenatal exposures to phthalate and phenol metabolites and their associations with body size measures of the infants at birth /were investigated/. /Investigators/ measured 5 phenol and 10 phthalate urinary metabolites in a multiethnic cohort of 404 women in New York City during  their third trimester of pregnancy and recorded size of infants at birth. Median urinary concentrations were > 10 ug/L for 2 of 5 phenols and 6 of 10 phthalate monoester metabolites. Concentrations of low-molecular-weight phthalate monoesters (low-MWP) were approximately 5-fold greater than those of high-molecular-weight metabolites. Low-MWP metabolites had a positive association with gestational age [0.97 day gestational age per ln-biomarker; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.07-1.9 days, multivariate adjusted] and with head circumference. Higher prenatal exposures to 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5-DCP) predicted lower birth weight in boys (-210 g average birth weight difference between the third tertile and first tertile of 2,5-DCP; 95% CI, 71-348 g). Higher maternal benzophenone-3 (BP3) concentrations were associated with a similar decrease in birth weight among girls but with greater birth weight in boys. ...",

Ocular irritation and discharge in all treatment groups. Salivation in 8 males and 4 females at 0.3 mg/L and in 7 males and 7 females at 1.0 mg/L. Dyspnea in one male and 7 females at 0.3 mg/L. Incidental findings: respiratory distress, skin irritation, cloudy spots on eyes, decreased activity and soaked abdomen. Body weight gain: decreased at 0.3 mg/L during week 2-4 and at 1.0 during week 1-4. Hematology: Hb increased at the high dose group, No. of leucocytes increased in females at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/L. Clinical chemistry: ASAT increased in high dose males and females. Urinalysis: no treatment related effects. Organ weights: Decreased absolute liver and brain weight in males at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/L. Increased relative lung weight in females at 1.0 mg/L. Decreased absolute heart weight in males at 0.3 mg/L. Increased relative kidney weight in all treated males. Gross pathology: Brown cyanotic/discolored areas, foci and atelectasis in the lungs were seen in 1-2 animals/sex/treatment and in controls. At 1.0 mg/L the incidence was slightly increased in females. Other incidental effects included hemorrhagic/hyperemic lymphnodes, effects on stomach mucosa, pale/discolored liver areas/foci and hemorrhagic foci and discoloration of the kidneys. Histopathology: Inflammatory cell and lymphocyte infiltrate, macrophage aggregation and septal fibrosis in the lungs of all treated animals. Inflammation of the nasal cavity (mucosa) in animals at 1.0 mg/L. Lymphocytic infiltrate, inflammation, foci and necrosis of the liver in treated and control animals. The incidence in control animals was slightly lower (9/20) compared to treatd animals (14-16/20). Statistical results: The effects on body weight, organ weight and blood parameters were statistically significant. None of the effects showed a clear concentration-response relationship. Conclusion: LOAEL 0.1 mg/L based on liver effects. Other effects seen were related to a weight decrease (organ weights) or could be attributed to irritant properties of the test substance (effects in the respiratory tract)."

It may naturally occur in soil via direct synthesis by soil fungi or fungi-derived enzymes utilizing humic phenols. Chlorophenols may be released into the environment through burning of biomass during forest fires. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.056 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,5-dichlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,5-dichlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 55 hours. 2,5-Dichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,5-dichlorophenol is expected to have low mobility based upon a Koc of 600. The pKa of 2,5-dichlorophenol is 7.51, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.03X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 2,5-Dichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure of 0.056 mm Hg. A 5% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test suggests that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, 2,5-dichlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc of 600. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 and 61 days, respectively. A BCF range of 4-35 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,5-dichlorophenol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,5-dichlorophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,5-dichlorophenol via ingestion of drinking water, via dermal contact with this compound, and via exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene, which is metabolized to 2,5-dichlorophenol.  2,5-Dichlorophenol has been detected in groundwater, surface waters, sewage effluents and industrial effluents. 2,5-Dichlorophenol has been detected in human urine and amniotic fluid.

Vapor-phase 2,5-dichlorophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 55 hours(SRC), calculated from its estimated rate constant of 6.99X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). 2,5-Dichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

After a lag period of approximately 4-6 weeks, 100% of the 2,5-dichlorophenol initially added to a freshwater pond sediment (which had been contaminated with asphalt) was observed to degrade within 2 weeks(1). The time required for 100% UV disappearance of 2,5-dichlorophenol being incubated in an aerobic silt loam soil suspension was in excess of 72 days(2). A ring degradation rate of 52% was observed over a 4 day incubation period in a mineral salts solution using an acclimated activated sludge(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2,5-dichlorophenol is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as about 8 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 61 days(SRC). 2,5-dichlorophenol's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). 2,5-Dichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This drug is almost completely absorbed after oral administration and converted into its active form, 1-(2',5'-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminoethanol) (DMAE), by the cleavage of a glycine residue. The intestinal H+-coupled peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) transports various peptide-like drugs and has been used as a target molecule for improving the intestinal absorption of poorly absorbed drugs through amino acid modifications. Because midodrine meets these requirements, we examined whether midodrine can be a substrate for PEPT1. The uptake of midodrine, but not DMAE, was markedly increased in PEPT1-expressing oocytes compared with water-injected oocytes. Midodrine uptake by Caco-2 cells was saturable and was inhibited by various PEPT1 substrates. Midodrine absorption from the rat intestine was very rapid and was significantly inhibited by the high-affinity PEPT1 substrate cyclacillin, assessed by the alteration of the area under the blood concentration-time curve for 30 min and the maximal concentration. Some amino acid derivatives of DMAE were transported by PEPT1, and their transport was dependent on the amino acids modified. In contrast to neutral substrates, cationic midodrine was taken up extensively at alkaline pH, and this pH profile was reproduced by a 14-state model of PEPT1, which we recently reported. These findings indicate that PEPT1 can transport midodrine and contributes to the high bioavailability of this drug and that Gly modification of DMAE is desirable for a prodrug of DMAE.",

Recombinant human CYP2D6, 1A2 and 2C19 exhibited appreciable catalytic activity with respect to the 5'-O-demethylation of DMAE. The O-demethylase activity by the recombinant CYP2D6 was much higher than that of other CYP isoforms. Quinidine (a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6) inhibited the O-demethylation of DMAE in pooled human microsomes by 86%, while selective inhibitors for other forms of CYP did not show any appreciable effect. Although the activity of CYP2D6 was almost negligible in the PM microsomes, the O-demethylase activity of DMAE was found to be maintained by about 25% of the pooled microsomes. Furafylline (a selective inhibitor of CYP1A2) inhibited the M-2 formation in the PM microsomes by 57%. The treatment of pooled microsomes with an antibody against CYP2D6 inhibited the formation of M-2 by about 75%, whereas that of the PM microsomes did not show drastic inhibition. In contrast, the antibody against CYP1A2 suppressed the activity by 40 to 50% in the PM microsomes. These findings suggest that CYP2D6 have the highest catalytic activity of DMAE 5'-O-demethylation in human liver microsomes, followed by CYP1A2 to a small extent.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

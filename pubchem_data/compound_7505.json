Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as intermediate for rubber chemicals; solvent for nitrile rubber, specialty lacquers, and many resins and polymers, and for many anhydrous metallic salts. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Benzonitrile was tested at a concentration of 2% in petrolatum on 27 volunteers in a mixed panel, and was found to produce no sensitization reactions after 48 hr close patch test. Extensive reddening and blister formation resulted from accidental exposure of human skin to benzonitrile. Following an occupational accident in which a worker's head and clothing were drenched with benzonitrile, the worker suffered severe respiratory distress and tonic convulsions between periods of unconsciousness which lasted for 75 min. Thereafter he gradually recovered, but several years later he experienced episodes of unconsciousness which might have been related to the benzonitrile exposure. ANIMAL STUDIES: CNS depression signs and changes in blood cholinesterase activity were observed in rats and mice in an inhalation study with benzonitrile. Indication of cumulative effects of benzonitrile were reported. Toxic signs included sluggishness, unsteady gait, a comatose state, convulsions of limb muscles, and death. Benzonitrile produced mild eye irritation and no skin irriation in albino rabbits. Benzonitrile applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was moderately irritating. When benzonitrile was administered orally to rats in a single lethal dose (2 g/kg), cytochrome oxidase activity of the liver, kidneys, and heart was increased by 2-4 times. The nitrile initially increased the hippuric acid and NH3 and decreased the glucuronides of the urine. Rhodanides in the blood remained unchanged. Certain responses of rats following exposure to benzonitrile vapor exhibited age-rated differences. Erythrocyte and leukocyte counts and hemoglobin , albumin and gamma-globulin levels decreased while alpha1-, alpha2- and beta-globulin levels increased earlier and were compensated far more rapidly in adult rats than in juvenile or older animals. Both, nitrobenzene and benzonitrile applied to V79 cells, induced mostly kinetochor (CREST)-positive micronuclei, thus characterising the chromosomal effects as aneugenic. Benzonitrile was tested for anticonvulsant effect in mice and gave protection against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions.",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

All the test nitriles liberated cyanide both in vivo and in vitro, with the exception of benzonitrile, although the extent of liberation and the effect of carbon tetrachloride pretreatment on the mortality of animals differed among nitriles. From these results, test compounds were tentatively divided into 3 groups. In group 1, acute toxicity was greatly reduced by carbon tetrachloride pretreatment, in group 2, toxicity was not significantly changed or was somewhat enhanced, and in group 3, benzonitrile only, toxicity was clearly enhanced. The amount of cyanide was higher at death in the brains of mice given group 1 compounds, the level being comparable to that found in mice killed by dosing with potassium cyanide. The relation between log (1/LD50) and log p for the compounds in group 1 fitted a parabolic plot, while that for compounds in group 2 was linear. For most nitriles, the in vitro metabolism was inhibited when the incubation mixture contained either SKF-525A, carbon monoxide, or microsomes from mice treated with carbon tetrachloride. When mice were dosed with ethyl alcohol, metabolic enhancement of nitriles was seen compared with the control. However, ethyl alcohol, when added to the incubation mixture, inhibited the in vitro metabolism of nitriles. /Nitriles/",

All the test nitriles liberated cyanide ions both in vivo and in vitro, with the exception of benzonitrile , although the extent of liberation and the effect of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) pretreatment on the mortality of animals differed among nitriles. From these results, test compounds were tentatively divided into three groups. In group 1 (13 compounds), acute toxicity was greatly reduced by CCl4 pretreatment, in group 2 (seven compounds), toxicity was not significantly changed or was somewhat enhanced, and in group 3, benzonitrile only, toxicity was clearly enhanced. The amount of cyanide was higher (0.68-0.80 microgram CN/g brain) at death in the brains of mice given group-1 compounds, the level being comparable to that found in mice killed by dosing with potassium cyanide. After oral doses of each nitrile, the time course for cyanide levels in the liver varied among the compounds. The difference between group-1 and -2 compounds lay in the dose-cyanide liberation relationship in liver, and in the kinetics for cyanide liberation in the hepatic microsomal enzyme system. Double-reciprocal plots of enzyme activity showed a linear relationship for nitriles of group 1 and a non-linear one for group 2. The relationship between log (1/LD50) and log P for the compounds in group 1 fitted a parabolic plot, while that for compounds in group 2 was linear.",

However, in rats, benzonitrile vapor inhalation at 900 ppm (3.8 mg/L) for 4 hr was not lethal, although exposure to approximately 950 ppm benzonitrile (4.1 mg/L) for 8 hr was lethal, 8.0 mg/L for 4 hr was lethal to three of ten animals, and 0.8 mg/L for 4 hr was without effect. Both rats and mice showed irritation of the extremities during the first hour of exposure and this was followed by labored breathing poor coordination and prostration. Surviving rats showed a subnormal weight gain. At autopsy, no abnormal lesions were observed, but microscopic examination revealed multifocal areas of lymphoid hyperplasia with foamy macrophage accumulations in the lungs of the rats. Congestion and edema were noted in the mouse lungs. Hepatic congestion and sinusoidal dilation were also seen in mice.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.768 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzonitrile will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase benzonitrile will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 31 days. Benzonitrile absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzonitrile is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 151. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.21X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Benzonitrile is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Benzonitrile achieved 88% degradation after 8, 10, and 12.5 hours in char-amended soil, soil, and washed-char-amended soil slurries, respectively, indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, benzonitrile is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 63% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 20 hours and 9 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 5 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Benzonitrile is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the presence of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzonitrile may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzonitrile is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzonitrile via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.21X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.768 mm Hg(5), and water solubility of 2000 mg/L(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 20 and 9 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 5(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 63% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks(8) indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Other screening studies give similar results (63.4-80.8%) and benzonitrile is confirmed to be biodegradable according to the standard test of the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Trade (MITI) that employs a mixed inoculum obtained from freshwater, soil, and sludge(2-4). The theoretical oxygen demand (ThOD) for benzonitrile in Ohio River Water from Cincinnati and/or aged sewage sludge were 0, 60, 90% and/or 0, 40, 80% after 2, 5, and 12 days, respectively(5). The BOD for benzonitrile in a bench-scale activated sludge unit was measured to be 93-98%(6). The BOD for benzonitrile in river water, present at 50 ppm, was 7%(7). Benzonitrile achieved 100% degradation after 280 minutes in a phosphate buffer solution in the soil and after 500 minutes in a soil slurry(8). Benzonitrile also achieved 20% and 44% in ash and ash-amended soil slurries at 2000 minutes, respectively(8). Benzonitrile achieved 88% degradation after 8, 10, and 12.5 hours in char-amended soil, soil and washed-char-amended soil slurries(9).",

Benzonitrile is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the presence of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Benzonitrile is hydrolyzed to benzoic acid in water, anaerobic river and sediment, and sediment extract at elevated temperatures(3). The first order hydrolysis rate of benzonitrile in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) was 0.045 1/day with a half-life of 15.4 days at 85 degrees C(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

After intraarterial injection of one of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (10 mg/kg) to trout, chemical concentration in the blood was found to decline triphasically with time. The terminal half-lives of elimination from the blood for 2-MN, fluorene and pyrene were 9.6, 10.5 and 12.8 hr, respectively. The toxicokinetics of the PAHs in trout were best described by a three-compartment open model with the central compartment and the deep peripheral compartment representing the blood and fatty tissues of trout, respectively. The PAHs were metabolized by trout mainly to water-soluble metabolites which were excreted into the urine and bile. When trout were exposed to water containing 2-MN, fluorene or pyrene (0.5 mg/L), the chemical was detected almost immediately in the blood. The apparent bioavailabilities of 2-MN, fluorene and pyrene in trout were 20, 36 and 35%, respectively. In contrast, little or no unchanged chemical was detected in the blood of trout following intragastric administration of 2-MN, fluorene or pyrene (50 mg/kg). These results indicate that the PAHs are absorbed systemically by trout via the branchial route at rates much faster than that of the oral route.",

To our knowledge this is the first study on the cometabolic degradation of the three-ring PAHs phenanthrene, anthracene and the four-ring PAH fluoranthene by a fluorene-utilizing species. Metabolism of fluorene was shown to proceed via the 9-fluorenone pathway to form o-phthalic acid and protocatechuic acid. The cometabolic mono-hydroxylation found for phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and anthracene shows similarity with the hydroxylation of fluorene. Several mono- and dihydroxy products and ring-cleavage products were identified for phenanthrene, fluoranthene and anthracene. It appeared that the cometabolism of those three compounds is a non-specific process, in contrast to the metabolism of fluorene. For dibenzothiophene the metabolites dibenzothiophene-5-oxide and dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxide were identified; these compounds appeared to be the products of a dead-end pathway. Since apart from dibenzothiophene no metabolites were found in very high concentrations for any of the other substrates, complete degradation is suggested, even for the cometabolic degradation of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and anthracene.",

Fluorene can be isolated from a greater than or equal to 60% fluorene fraction by continuous countercurrent crystallization. It is possible to refine the technical product further by reaction with sodium or sodium amide. Alternatively, purification is performed with sulfuric acid and subsequent crystallization from methanol. Fluorene is also synthesized from acetylene in a red-hot tube in the presence of hydrogen. It can be distilled from charcoal in the presence of fuming nitric acid or from refluxing 2,2'-dibromodiphenylmethane with hydrazine hydrate in the presence of palladium. Reduction of diphenylene ketone with zinc also forms fluorene.",

There are more than 100 different PAHs. PAHs generally occur as complex mixtures (for example, as part of combustion products such as soot), not as single compounds. PAHs usually occur naturally, but they can be manufactured as individual compounds for research purposes; however, not as the mixtures found in combustion products. ... Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil. They can occur in the air, either attached to dust particles or as solids in soil or sediment. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

A urine sample containing conjugates of OHPAHs was hydrolysed in the presence of beta-glucuronidase/aryl sulfatase and the solution was cleaned up with a solid-phase extraction (C(18) and silica). Eight OHPAHs, namely 1- and 2-hydroxynaphthalenes, 2-hydroxyfluorene, 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyphenanthrenes, 3-hydroxyfluoranthene and 1-hydroxypyrene, were separated and 1- and 9-hydroxyphenanthrenes co-eluted on an alkylamide-type reversed-phase column with fluorimetric detection. The urinary concentrations of OHPAHs were quantified by using deuterated 1-hydoxypyrene as an internal standard. The method showed good repeatability for inter- and intra-day precisions as well as good linearity of calibration curves (r (2) ranged from 0.996 to 0.999). The limits of detection (S/n=3) were in the range from 2.3 fmol to 2.2 pmol per injection. This method was successfully applied to urine samples from non-smoking taxi drivers, traffic policemen, and rural villagers of Chiang Mai, Thailand. The results showed higher urinary concentrations of OHPAHs in rural villagers, consistent with higher respiratory exposure to PAHs.",

The vial was immediately heated to 70 \u00b0C in an aluminium block heater, the needle of the SPME device was inserted through the septum of the vial, and the extraction fiber was exposed to the headspace for 15 min. Afterwards, the compounds extracted by the fiber were desorbed simultaneously by exposing the fiber in the gas chromatograph injection port. No interferences were found, and the time for analysis was about 30 min for one sample. This method was applied to a suicide case in which the victim ingested naphthalene, fluorene, and anthracene.",

The suitability of the method for profile analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites is shown by analyzing an urine of an occupationally exposed person after enzymatic cleavage of the excreted conjugates. Satisfactory separation of all investigated metabolites was achieved without interferences due to matrix peaks.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Derivatives of fluorene show activity as herbicides and growth regulators. It is used as a chemical intermediate. Fluorene occurs ubiquitously in products of incomplete combustion; it also occurs in fossil fuels. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: The agent is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. ANIMAL STUDIES: A single topical application of fluorene at a dose of 1 mg/10 g to neonatal rats resulted in a significant induction of skin and liver aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin o-deethylase activities. Repeated oral administration of fluorene to adult male rats led to a reduction in rat anxiety level at the lowest doses administered (1 and 10 mg/kg/day) regardless of the treatment route, whereas locomotor activity and learning abilities remained unchanged. Significant increases in relative liver weight were also observed in a dose-dependent manner in orally treated rats and only in animal treated i.p. with 100 mg/kg/day. A group of 18 female rats were fed 0.05% fluorene in the diet for 18 months (total average intake, 2553 mg/rat), and surviving animals were killed at 20.1 months. Tumors reported were one uterine carcinosarcoma, one uterine fibrosarcoma, one granulocytic leukemia, and four pituitary adenomas. In a control group of 18 rats fed basal diet for an average of 15.5 months, one uterine adenocarcinoma, two uterine fibro-epithelial polyps, five adrenal cortical adenomas, six pituitary adenomas, and one inguinal region fibroma were reported. Fluorene was not mutagenic to Salmonella typhmurium, and it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat hepatocyte cultures. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Static toxicity tests were conducted with fluorene on daphnids (Daphnia magna), larval midges (Chironomus riparius), amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus), snails (Mudalia potosensis), mayflies (Hexagenia bilineata), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), aquatic macrophytes (Chara sp), and green algae (Selanastrum capricornutum). Daphnia magna was the most sensitive organism tested with a 48 hr median effective concn of 0.43 mg/L. Fathead minnows were the least sensitive species, with no mortality at fluorene concentrations as high as 100 mg/L.",

These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates.

Although rather unsusceptible to the malignancy-inducing action of carcinogens, a single oral dose of various tumorigenic xenobiotics induced an additive mitotic response of adrenocortical cells studied after 48 hr. Presently we report on three different response patterns in rats. First, a selective mitostimulation of the zona glomerulosa occured after reserpine associated with a loss of body weight, thymus and liver weight. These are unspecific stress effects and occur also after exogenous adrenocorticotrhophic hormone (ACTH). Second, hepatomitogenic and liver-enlarging congeners, e.g., fluorene (FEN), fluorenone (FON) and 4-benzoyl-FON, but also the genotoxic 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and 2,4,7-trinitro-FON induced a selective mitotic response of the zona fasciculata (ZF). After the lowest effective dose of FEN or FON the afore-mentioned effects occured simultaneously, but were absent in the high dose group (only studied with fluorene). The 2-benzyl and 2-benzoyl-substituted derivatives were ineffective at all. Third, a bizonal response was found only after phenobarbital (PB) or the lowest effective FEN dose. The preventive action of a low PB dose on the 2-AAF-induced ZF response indicates a modified metabolism. We conclude that the rapid mitotic ZF response is an endogenously mediated net effect of interactions between metabolic and various adaptive mechanisms. The latter are reported to be activated in a stressor-dependent manner and converge in the adrenals. In this way the early mitotic ZF response could reflect indirectly 'specific' proliferation-prone properties of xenobiotics.",

Abeta peptide arises from cleavage of the membrane-associated domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta and gamma secretases. Several lines of evidence point to the soluble Abeta oligomer (AbetaO) as the primary neurotoxic species in the etiology of AD. Recently, we have demonstrated that a class of fluorene molecules specifically disrupts the AbetaO species. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this disruptive ability, we extend the application of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of site-directed spin labels in the Abeta peptide to investigate the binding and influence of fluorene compounds on AbetaO structure and dynamics. In addition, we have synthesized a spin-labeled fluorene (SLF) containing a pyrroline nitroxide group that provides both increased cell protection against AbetaO toxicity and a route to directly observe the binding of the fluoreneto the AbetaO assembly. We also evaluate the ability of fluorenes to target multiple pathological processes involved in the neurodegenerative cascade, such as their ability to block AbetaO toxicity, scavenge free radicals and diminish the formation of intracellular AbetaO species. Fluorene modified with pyrroline nitroxide may be especially useful in counteracting Abeta peptide toxicity, because they possess both antioxidant properties and the ability to disrupt AbetaO species. /Spin-labeled fluorene/",

The reconstituted PAH mixture contained the following 17 congeners: 2-rings (indan, naphthalene, 1-, and 2-methylnaphthalene), 3-rings (acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, dibenzofuran, fluorene, phenanthrene, and anthracene), and >/= 4-rings (pyrene, fluoranthene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene), and resembled mixtures identified as by-products from manufactured gas plants. The reconstituted mixture and the 2-, 3- and >/= 4-ring PAH fractions all caused a dose-dependent decrease in the splenic plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to SRBCs or TNP-LPS, and their ED50 values for the four treatment groups were 86, 354, 145, and 23 or 163, 439, 637, and 31 mg/kg, respectively. The corresponding ED50 values for decreased serum anti-TNP IgM levels for these same mixtures were (TNP-haptenated SRBCs, T-cell-dependent) 144, 231, 42 and 27 units, respectively, and (TNP-LPS, T-cell-independent) 161, 406, 312, and 69 units, respectively. The suppression of anti-TNP IgM titers was similar to the suppression of the PFC response and shows that antigen-specific immunoglobulin titer can be used as a biomarker of PAH exposure. A direct comparison of the immunotoxic responses of the reconstituted PAH mixture and the corresponding dose of the >/= 4-ring PAHs indicated that the latter fraction was primarily responsible for the activity of the reconstituted mixture.",

Demonstrated to be a neurotoxicant through inhalation, it was also identified as a contributive PAH to food contamination. Since no data are available on its oral neurotoxicity, the purpose of the present study was to assess the behavioral and physiological toxicity of repeated oral administration of fluorene to adult Wistar male rats. Animals were daily treated with fluorene at 1, 10 or 100 mg/kg/day for 28 consecutive days. Administration was intraperitoneal (i.p.) or oral (p.o.) to evaluate the influence of the route of exposure on fluorene toxicity. Following this period of treatment, animals in both groups were subjected to similar cognitive evaluations, namely anxiety (elevated-plus maze), locomotor activity (open-field) and learning and memory abilities (eight-arm maze and avoidance test of an aversive light stimulus), as well as physiological measurements. The behavioral testing occurred from the 28th to the 60th day of the experiment during which fluorene treatment continued uninterrupted. At the end of this period, the concentration levels of fluorene and of three of its monohydroxylated metabolites in blood and brain were determined using a GC-MS/MS method. The results demonstrated a reduction in rat anxiety level at the lowest doses administered (1 and 10 mg/kg/day) regardless of the treatment route, whereas locomotor activity and learning abilities remained unchanged. Moreover, a less significant weight gain was noticed in animals i.p.- and p.o.-treated with 100 mg/kg/day during the 28-day period of treatment, which, upon comparison with the three other groups, induced a body weight gap that was maintained throughout the experiment. Significant increases in relative liver weight were also observed in a dose-dependent manner in orally treated rats and only in animal treated i.p. with 100mg/kg/day. According to the dose, higher concentration levels of fluorene and its monohydroxylated metabolites were measured in blood and brain compartments of i.p.-treated rats compared to p.o.-treated animals. In conclusion, fluorene reduced the anxiety level of rats related to dose, treatment route, duration of exposure, and blood concentration levels of metabolites.",

Daphnia magna was the most sensitive organism tested with a 48 hr median effective concn of 0.43 mg/L. Fathead minnows were the least sensitive species, with no mortality at fluorene concentrations as high as 100 mg/L. In a 14 day test, fluorene exposure inhibited algal production at a threshold level of approximately 3.0 mg/L. Complete life cycle chronic toxicity tests were conducted with fluorene on daphnids and larval midges. Daphnid reproduction was significantly reduced at fluorene levels of 0.125 mg/L after 14 days. Emergence of larval midges was delayed at a concentration of 0.6 mg/L. In a 30-day partial life cycle study that was conducted to determined the impact of fluorene on growth, survival, and behavior of fingerling bluegill, survival was reduced at exposures of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L and growth was inhibited at exposures of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/L. Measurements of several behavioral characteristics indicated impairment of swimming and feeding activities at fluorene concentrations as low as 0.12 mg/L.",

The lowest observed (p<0.05) effect level (LOEL) for dark respiration (Rni) was 0.12 mg/L fluorene in three of the four communities during the first 14 days. The LOEL for Rni in the fourth community was 5.0 mg/L. The LOEL of the net productivity/respiration ratio (Pn/Rni) was 0.12 mg/L in all four communities. These results suggest that the responses of these microcosms were not completely independent of their source communities. The sensitivities or LOEL values from these microcosm experiments were as low as those reported for chronic bioassays of the three most sensitive of seven standard test organisms. Comparisons between the responses of these microcosms and those reported for experimental ponds exposed to the same concentrations of fluorene suggest that these microcosms accurately reflect the types of changes and concentrations that cause change in pond ecosystems. However, slight but significant changes in the ecosystem-level variables gave no indication of the almost complete elimination of some zooplankton populations at 5.0 and 10.0 mg/L in the ponds and at 2.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/L in the microcosms. This lack of correspondence between population- and ecosystem-level measurements suggests that test measurements made at one hierarchical level of organization may not always be appropriate for estimating effects at other levels.",

The present study compared the toxic effects of combined mixed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals on growth and antioxidant responses of free and immobilized microalga, Selenastrum capricornutum. Five PAHs-phenanthrene, fluorene, fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene-and four heavy metals at different concentrations-0.05 to 0.1 ug Cd2+/mL, 0.05 to 1 ug Cu2+/mL, 0.05 to 1 ug Zn2+/mL, and 0.5 to 2.5 ug Ni2+/mL-were examined. Results showed that the chlorophyll a content of free and immobilized S. capricornutum was not affected by PAHs but was significantly inhibited by heavy metals. Conversely, the antioxidant parameters, including the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) and the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase, were significantly induced by both PAHs and metals. For the combined toxic effects of PAHs and heavy metals, cell growth and antioxidant responses varied with exposure time and contaminants and differed between free and immobilized cells. The effects of cocontaminants on the GSH content in free cells were mainly synergistic but changed to antagonistic in immobilized cells. The toxic effects of cocontamination on free cells were also more obvious than those on immobilized cells. These findings suggest that immobilization offers some protection to microalgal cells against toxic contaminants causing differences in the interaction and responses to combined toxicants between free and immobilized cells. Immobilized cells might be more suitable for treating wastewater containing toxic contaminants than free cells",

Its release to the environment is wide spread since it is a ubiquitous product of incomplete combustion. It is released to the atmosphere in emissions from the combustion of oil, gasoline, coal, wood and refuse. Fluorene's production and use in the manufacture of resinous products and dyestuffs may also result in its release to the environment in variosu waste streams. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.0X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates fluorene will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase fluorene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days. Particulate-phase fluorene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Fluorene absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. However, particulate phase fluorene can be stable to photo-oxidation which will permit its long range global transport. If released to soil, fluorene is expected to be immobile based upon a log Koc range of 3.70 to 4.21. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.62X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Fluorene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Greater than 92% of initial fluorene was biodegraded using soil contaminated with creosote. No biodegradation occurred using pristine soil suggesting that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in acclimated soil. If released into water, fluorene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Using a river die-away test, little or no fluorene was degraded to CO2 over a 24 hr incubation period, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hrs and 9 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 190 days if adsorption is considered. Measured log BCF values of 3.02-3.35 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to fluorene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where fluorene is inadvertently produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to fluorene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and smoking cigarettes. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(5) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.62X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(6). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hrs and 9 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 190 days if adsorption is considered(7). According to a classification scheme(8), a log BCF range of 3.02-3.35(9) indicates that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Using a river die-away test, little or no fluorene was degraded to CO2 over a 24 hr incubation period(4), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Vapor-phase fluorene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.30X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Particulate-phase fluorene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Ambient air monitoring has shown that relatively small percentages of atmospheric fluorene are associated with particulate-phase material(4,5). Fluorene absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm(6,7) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Photodegradation on particulates is highly dependent on the absorbing substrate(8); substrates containing more than 5% carbon can stabilize photodegradation and permit long range global transport of fluorene(8).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

A review of environmental fate for fluorene has reported a fluorene biotransformation rate constant of 0.0062-0.01/hr(2); this corresponds to a half-life of 2.9-4.6 days(SRC). In a 7 day static incubation study using a sewage seed (followed by three weekly subculture inoculations for a total of 28 days of incubation), 65-82% of initial fluorene (5 and 10 ppm) was degraded after 7 days and 45-77% (of total additions) was degraded after 28 days(3); fluorene was classified as significantly degraded with gradual microbial adaptation(3). In biodegradation screening studies using subsurface soil from a contaminated creosote site, >92% of initial fluorene degraded within 1 week of incubation(4); in autoclaved soil, the degradation rate fell to 3.4% per week(4); using soil from a pristine site, the degradation rate was not statistically different between autoclaved and non-autoclaved soil suggesting that microbial adaptation to fluorene is important in subsurface regions(4).",

The following half-lives were determined for the photolysis (using a rotary photoreactor, 300-410 nm) of fluorene absorbed on various substrates: silica gel, 110 hr; alumina, 62 hr; fly ash, 37 hr; carbon black, >1000 hr(3). Additional photolysis studies with 15 different types of coal fly ash found that half-lives are highly dependent upon substrate; fluorene photolytic half-lives varied from 38 to >1000 hrs. The dominant factor in preventing atmospheric photodegradation is the color of the absorbing substrate. Fly ash samples that stabilize fluorene reaction absorb the most light and prevent light from getting to the fluorene(4). Polyaromatic hydrocarbons are stabilized when the carbon content of the fly ash is greater than 5%(4). Studies involving fluorene adsorbed to coal fly ash have shown that fluorene can be oxidized to 9-fluorenone by non-photochemical means (eg. under dark conditions). The exact pathway for this oxidation was not discussed(SRC) but it was suggested that certain metals that occur in fly ash may have some catalytic effect(5). The photolysis rate constant for 1.2 mg/L fluorene was 0.091/min, corresponding to a half-life of 8.0 minutes, in rainwater collected in Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan and using a solar simulator. The half-life was 26.8 minutes using a pure aqueous solution(6).",

A log BCF of 3.15 (1412) was measured in mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) exposed over a 33 day exposure using an aquatic ecosystem(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that fluorene is expected to be immobile in soil. Log Koc values of 6.52 and 6.45 were reported using sediment from Lake Ketelmeer, The Netherlands(5). In an adsorption study using an estuarine water, 12% of added fluorene was adsorbed by particulate matter in water (organic matter, bacteria, clay particles, etc) over a 3-hour period which indicates that adsorption in natural estuarine water is an important environmental fate process(6).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that fluorene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 15 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9 days(SRC). Fluorene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 190 days if adsorption is considered(3). Fluorene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 6.0X10-4 mm Hg(4). In a bench-scale biotreatability study, surface volatilization losses of fluorene (solid-phase treatment) and other PAHs amounted to less than 0.01% of total additions(5).",

Fluorene concentrations of 1.4-9.3 ng/L were detected in samples collected from the Rainy River (between Ontario and Minnesota) in 1988(2). Water samples collected from the central and eastern regions of Lake Superior in Aug 1986 had an average dissolved fluorene concentration of 0.63 ng/L(3). Mean fluorene concentrations were reported as 567, 206, 274, 249 and 90 pg/L for Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, Lake Ontario and Lake Superior, respectively(4). Water samples taken from the Mackenzie River (Canada) in 1986 contained fluorene levels of 0.04-1.173 ug/L(5). Monitoring conducted in the summer of 1984 found fluorene concentrations of 1-2 ng/L in Mississippi River water collected at the inflow of the Ohio River and at Memphis, TN(6). Fluorene concentrations were 0.05, 0.03 and 0.02 ug/L in river water, waste water and wastewater treatment plant samples, respectively, from the Haihe River System, China. Differences in concentrations were negligible during the heating (December) and non heating (August) seasons in 2011. Concentrations on associated particulates were 0.8, 1.5 and 2.0 ug/g, respectively(7). Surface water samples from Wojin, Chanshu and Binhu located in Jiangsu Province China, contained fluorine concentrations of 4.7, 4.7 and 2.8 ng/L respectively, sampled in October 2010(8). Fluorene was detected at an average concentration of 1.7 ng/L (4.6 ng/L max) in 11 of 11 samples from the Guadalquivir River; 1.1 ng/L (2.7 ng/L max) in 11 of 11 samples from associated wetlands; and average concentrations of 1.0-1.5 ng/L (1.3-6.0 ng/L max; 88.9 to 100% frequency) in 5 reservoirs. Sample region is located in the province of Jaen, South East Spain; samples were collected from April 2009 to November 2010(9).",

Monitoring of a gasoline engine (1983 Honda Civic) and a diesel engine (1982 Volkswagen Rabbit) detected fluorene exhaust concentrations of 4.3-7.5 and 2.7-4.9 ug/cu m respectively(4). Emission tests with a gasoline-fueled automobile (1984 Volvo) measured fluorene emission rates of 11-42 ug/km(5).",

Sediments from the contaminated region of the harbor contained particularly high concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene and benz[a]anthracene), and a variety of nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds (e.g., carbazole and acridine). The composition of the aromatic compounds was characteristic of creosote. Dramatically lower concentrations of aromatic compounds were found in sediments from a reference site in which the bottom-dwelling fish examined were free of detectable neoplastic or 'preneoplastic' hepatic lesions. Food organisms in the stomachs of the English sole from Eagle Harbor contained substantially higher concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons than comparable organisms from the reference site. The concentrations of individual aromatic hydrocarbons in muscle and liver from the Eagle Harbor fish were low; however, high concentrations of metabolites of aromatic compounds were present in the bile. The findings strongly suggest an association between exposure to creosote and the prevalence of hepatic lesions, including neoplasms, in the bottom-dwelling fish, and furthermore support the putative role of aromatic hydrocarbons in liver carcinogenesis in fish",

The total concentrations of 17 PAHs (summation operator PAHs) in the chamber were 3500 and 1152 ng/cu m in vapor phase and particulate phase, respectively. In vapor phase, the yield of naphthalene (NA) appeared to be the most abundant (2462 ng/cig) followed by fluorene (FLUOR) and acenaphthylene (ACY), while the yield of benzo[ghi]perylene (BP) was the most abundant (259.7 ng/cig) in particulate phase followed by phenanthrene (PHEN) and FLUOR. The proportion of PAHs in particulate phase increased with increasing molecular weight. PAHs with two to six rings accounted for 40.2%, 35.3%, 11.7%, 7.6%, 5.2% of summation operator PAHs, respectively. There was no obvious correlation between PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) concentrations in tobacco smoke and smoking tar contents, nicotine contents. With the source fingerprint of PAHs in tobacco smoke, NA could be regarded as the marker of tobacco smoke source because of its largest contribution to summation operator PAHs (40.2%), followed by FLUOR (12.7%) and ACY (9.8%). Further study indicated that more than 80% of BaP in indoor air of resident homes in Hangzhou was from tobacco smoke. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

The average exposure of workers to fluorene in the paving, roofing and steel industries is reported to be about 0.5 ug/cu m(3); avg exposure to workers in the aluminum refinery, silicon carbide and refractory brick industries is reported to be about 20 ug/cu m(3). Fluorene concns of 0.1 to 22 ug/cu m were detected in a Finish plant where creosote was used to impregnate wood(4). In a monitoring study of emissions generated during the pouring, cooling and shakeout of aluminum and iron castings made with the evaporative pattern casting process, fluorene levels of <90 ug/kg (detection limit) to 230 ug/kg were detected(5).

In a Danish survey of smokehouses (facilities for smoke-curing of food), typical fluorene concentrations of 25 and 38 ug/cu m were found in the particulate-phase and gas-phase, respectively, in the areas of the smoking kilns(2). The average exposure of workers to fluorene in the paving, roofing and steel industries is reported to be about 0.5 ug/cu m(3); average exposure to workers in the aluminum refinery, silicon carbide and refractory brick industries is reported to be about 20 ug/cu m(3). Fluorene concentrations of 0.1 to 22 ug/cu m were detected in a Finish plant where creosote was used to impregnate wood(4). In a monitoring study of emissions generated during the pouring, cooling and shakeout of aluminum and iron castings made with the evaporative pattern casting process, fluorene levels of <90 ug/kg (detection limit) to 230 ug/kg were detected(5). Typical fluorene levels of 9.24 ug/cu m were detected in workplace air in an aluminum manufacturing facility(6).",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct population-specific probabilistic health risk assessments based on consumption of locally harvested white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus) among Vietnamese Americans in southeast Louisiana. METHODS: We conducted a survey of Vietnamese Americans in southeast Louisiana to evaluate shrimp consumption, preparation methods, and body weight among shrimp consumers in the disaster-impacted region. We also collected and chemically analyzed locally harvested white shrimp for 81 individual PAHs. We combined the PAH levels (with accepted reference doses) found in the shrimp with the survey data to conduct Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic noncancer health risk assessments. We also conducted probabilistic cancer risk assessments using relative potency factors (RPFs) to estimate cancer risks from the intake of PAHs from white shrimp. RESULTS: Monte Carlo simulations were used to generate hazard quotient distributions for noncancer health risks, reported as mean, for naphthalene (1.8X10-4), fluorene (2.4X10-5), anthracene (3.9X10-6), pyrene (3.2X10-5), and fluoranthene (1.8X10-4). A cancer risk distribution, based on RPF-adjusted PAH intake, was also generated (2.4X10-7). CONCLUSIONS: The risk assessment results show no acute health risks or excess cancer risk associated with consumption of shrimp containing the levels of PAHs detected in our study, even among frequent shrimp consumers.",

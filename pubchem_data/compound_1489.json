When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Lee) and cocklebur (Xanthium sp.) contained beta-oxidase enzymes that were capable of degrading 2,4-DB to 2,4-D. An intermediate metabolite was identified as 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) crotonic acid. Another metabolite pathway was indicated by synthesis of 10-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)decanoic acid. 2,4-DB(14)C was applied to curly dock (Rumex crispus L.) and buckhorn plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.). The main pathway of metabolism was beta-oxidation and 2,4-D was identified as the major metabolite. Other unidentified metabolites appeared bound to polar lipids. 2,4-DB methyl ester was administered in soybean oil to a guinea pig. Urine was collected and GLC-MS analysis indicated the presence of the methyl ester of 2,4-D after treatment of the extract with diazomethane. Phytophthora megasprma var. sojae and cell suspensions of white clover (Trifolium repens) were not able to metabolize 2,4-D but did degrade 2,4-DB by a path not including beta- oxidation. Over a 21-day period, the fungus Phytophthora megasperma degraded about 45% of the 2,4-DB present. Since no 2,4-D was found in the nutrient medium, or fungus myceluim, it was concluded that degradation did not include beta-oxidation of 2,4-DB. The fungus did degrade 2,4-D. In Saskatchewan soils, hydrolysis of n-butyl 2,4-DB ester was rapid but products were not identified.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The process of preparing the samples includes acid hydrolysis, extaction with benzene, derivatization with diazoethane, and column chromatograhic cleanup. The more volatile cmpd were quantified by using capillary column GC/pos chemical ionization/MS/MS. Less volatile cmpd were quantified by using electron capture neg chemical ionization in a single stage mass spectrometry mode. Quality control samples were included in each analytical run. Pos values for the target analytes were determined on the basis of appropriate relative retention time, a signal-to-noise ratio >3:1, and a calculated concn >1 ppb. The chlorine isotope ratios were determined for each cmpd to assess the presence or absence of interferences. This analytical method was applied in a case control study of 199 individuals to examine exposure to the 12 target analytes.",

For severe, acute oral poisoning by 2,4-DB or 2,4-D, forced alkaline diuresis appears to be most effective (A7734). Forced alkaline diuresis is often used to increase the excretion of acidic drugs like salicylates and phenobarbitone. For forced alkaline diuresis, a diuretic like furosemide is given intravenously and sodium bicarbonate is added to the infusion fluid to make blood and, in turn, urine alkaline. Potassium replacement becomes of utmost importance during the process because potassium is usually lost in urine. If blood levels of potassium are depleted below normal levels, then hypokalemia occurs, which promotes bicarbonate ion retention and prevents bicarbonate excretion, thus interfering with the alkalinization of the urine.",

If vigorous emesis has not occurred, measures should be taken to empty the stomach and limit GI absorption by gastric intubation, aspiration, and lavage, following placement of a cuffed endotracheal tube. Repeated administration of charcoal at half or more the original dosage every 2-4 hr may be beneficial. If gastric aspiration and lavage is not performed due to delay in treatment, and if the patient is fully alert, administer charcoal and laxative orally. Administer intravenous fluids to accelerate excretion of the chlorophenoxy compound, and to limit concentration of the toxicant in the kidney. A urine flow of 4-6 ml/min is desirable. Iv saline/dextrose has sufficed to rescue comatose patients who drank 2,4-D and mecoprop several hours before hospital admission. Caution: Monitor urine protein and cells, BUN, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes, and fluid intake/output carefully to insure that renal function remains unimpaired and that fluid overload dose not occur. Forced alkaline diuresis has been used successfully in management of suicidal ingestions of chlorophenoxy compounds. Alkalinizing the urine by including sodium bicarbonate (44-88 mEq/l) in the iv solution apparently accelerates excretion of 2,4-D dramatically and mecoprop excretion substantially. Urine pH should be maintained in the 7.5-8.8 range. Include potassium chloride as needed to offset increased potassium losses: add 20-40 mEq of potassium chloride to each liter of iv solution. Monitor serum electrolytes carefully. There may possibly be some hazard to the kidneys when urine concentrations of toxicant are very high, so integrity of renal function and fluid balance should be monitored carefully as the chlorophenoxy compound is excreted. Hemodialysis is not likely to be of significant benefit in poisonings by chlorophenoxy compounds because of the extensive protein binding of these chemicals. Follow-up clinical examinations should include electromyographic and nerve conduction studies to detect any neuropathic changes and neuromuscular junction defects. /Chlorophenoxy cmpd/",

All persons were followed up in the cancer environment register during the period 1961-79. A total of 331 cases of soft tissue sarcomas was observed in the study cohort and there were 1,508 cases in the reference group (relative risk 0.9; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.0). No subcohort of agricultural or forestry workers showed any significantly increased relative risk, nor was there any significant difference in relative risk between the subcohorts. Despite the greatly increased use of phenoxy acid herbicides from 1947 to 1970, no time related increase in the relative risk of soft tissue sarcoma was found in the total cohort or in any of the subcohorts. /Phenoxy acid herbicides/"

Male Wistar rats were given 0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg of 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxypropionic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyric acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropionic acid, or 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid intragastrically for 3 days. They were killed 24 hr after the last dose and weighed. The livers were removed and weighed. The livers were assayed for total cytochrome p450, cytochrome p450-IVA1, cytochrome p450b, cytochrome p450, lauric-acid-12-hydroxylase, and lauric-acid-11-hydroxylase. Benzphetamine-N-demethylase and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase were used as marker enzymes for cytochrome p450b and cytochrome p450, respectively. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxypropionic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid increased body weight gain and relative liver weights. All seven compounds increased total hepatic cytochrome p450 content in a dose dependent manner. Cytochrome p450 was significantly induced by all compounds except 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid. 2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid was the most potent inducer. p450IVA1 was significantly induced by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and 4-chloro-2methylphenoxyacetic acid. None of the compounds significantly affected cytochrome p450b. All compounds except 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid induced lauric-acid-12-hydroxylase activity, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid being the most potent. lauric-acid-12-hydroxylase activity was only slightly stimulated by the compounds. Induction of lauric-acid-12-hydroxylase activity was correlated with an increase in cytochrome p450-IVA1 content. It was concluded that chlorophenoxy herbicides are relatively specific inducers of the cytochrome p450-IVA1 dependent lauric-acid-12-hydroxylase isozyme. Induction of lauric-acid-12-hydroxylase appears to increase with increasing chlorination of the aromatic ring.",

If released to soil or water, microbial degradation will be the major environmental degradation process. Microbial degradation occurs through a beta-oxidation mechanism that yields (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid (2,4-D). In laboratory persistence studies, 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid has exhibited a soil half-life of less than 7 days. At normal herbicide application rates, 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid has a residual activity of about 6 weeks in soil. If released to the atmosphere, 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid can exist in both the vapor and particulate-phases; vapor-phase 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid degrades readily by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 27 hours). Physical removal from the atmosphere may occur through wet and dry deposition. Occupational exposure to 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid occurs through dermal contact and inhalation of dust. The predominant route of occupational exposure has been by the absorption of spills or aerosol droplets through the skin. (SRC)",

The microbial degradation occurs through a beta-oxidation mechanism to form (2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid (2,4-D)(2-3). In moist soils at 21 \u00b0C, the beta-oxidation half-life is about 3-4 days(3). In laboratory persistence studies using three different soil types (heavy clay, clay loam, sandy loam), half-lives of less than 7 days were observed(4). At normal herbicide application rates, 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid has a residual activity of about 6 weeks in soil(2). An experimentally measured Koc value of 370(5) suggests that 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid will be moderately mobile in soil and could therefore leach(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

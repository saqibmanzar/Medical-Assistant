The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

With usual maternal dosage, the amount excreted into breastmilk is much less than the dose that has been given to newborn infants for analgesia and is unlikely to adversely affect nursing infants. Studies in breastfed newborn infants found no adverse effects attributable to tramadol. However, a death occurred in the 8-month-old breastfed infant of a woman addicted to tramadol, but breastfeeding exposure alone might not have accounted for the death. Maternal use of oral opioids during breastfeeding can cause infant drowsiness, which may progress to rare but\u00a0severe central nervous system depression. Newborn infants seem to be particularly sensitive to the effects of even small dosages of narcotic analgesics.\u00a0If the mother of a newborn requires tramadol, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding; however,\u00a0once the mother's milk comes in, it is best to provide pain control with a nonnarcotic analgesic and limit maternal intake of oral tramadol to 2 to 3 days at a low dosage with close infant monitoring. The US Food and Drug Administration and the manufacturer recommend against the use of tramadol during breastfeeding. If tramadol is used, monitor infants for increased sleepiness (more than usual), difficulty breastfeeding, breathing difficulties or limpness, and contact a physician immediately if any of these occur.",

In the ICU, the infant had a positive urine drug screen for tramadol and a negative urine test for cannabinoids and opiates. Two doses of naloxone improved her blood gases and 2 days later her mental status had improved. The infant\u2019s parents stated that they were addicted to tramadol and the mother was breastfeeding the infant. The infant was discharged on day 3 after admission. Thirty-six hours later, the infant again presented to the ED with cardiopulmonary arrest, with a 4 on the Glasgow coma scale and generalized clonic-tonic seizures. The infant died from cardiac arrest 3 days after admission. The mother stated that she had breastfed the infant after the initial discharge from the hospital. The author speculates that mother or infant might be an ultra-rapid CYP2D6 metabolizer leading to high levels of the active metabolite, because this variant is relatively prevalent in those of Mediterranean origin. However, neither genetic testing nor measurement of tramadol in milk or the infant were performed. This case cannot definitely be attributed to breastmilk exposure alone, because the sudden onset of the symptoms at 8-months of age seems implausible. It is somewhat more likely that the baby ingested the tramadol directly.",

Spinal anesthesia consisted of hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg and fentanyl 0.01 mg; epidural anesthesia consisted of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% (0.5 mg per 10 cm height) and fentanyl 0.05 mg. General anesthesia consisted of propofol 2.3 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg for induction and intubation, followed by an anesthetic gas mixture and oxygen. Reportedly, nitric oxide (possibly nitrous oxide) was 50% of the gas before delivery and 67% after delivery. Sevoflurane was also used in some cases. After delivery and cord clamping, mothers received fentanyl 3 mcg/kg and rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg intravenously for placental delivery. After surgery, neuromuscular block reversal was performed with neostigmine and atropine. All patients received 1 mg/kg of diclofenac every 8 h for 24 hours after delivery and 98% of general anesthesia patients also received 100 mg of tramadol and 78.5% received acetaminophen 1 gram. No regional anesthesia patients received tramadol or acetaminophen. Patients receiving one of the regional anesthetic protocols established lactation sooner (56% and 29% after 18 and 24 hours, respectively), while 86% of women receiving general anesthesia did not establish lactation until 36 to 48 hours after surgery.",

The time to initiate breastfeeding was significantly shorter among mothers who received tramadol than a placebo, 1.7 vs 4.1 hours with breastfeeding support and 3.7 vs 6.2 hours without support.

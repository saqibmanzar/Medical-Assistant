Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

Heptanol inhibited both pressure generation and electrical conduction. These effects were completely reversible ... Low concentrations of heptanol (less than 0.3 mM) caused small but significant increases in the delay between the stimulus (delivered to the basal septum) artifact and local activation of the left ventricle, as measured from bipolar electrogram (BEG) recordings. There was a steep increase in the latency between stimulus and left-ventricular activation at concentrations of heptanol above 0.3 mM ... Heptanol decreased repolarization duration, measured from the activation recovery interval (ARI) of BEGs, and monophasic action potential duration at 70% repolarization (MAPD70). Heptanol also reduced left-ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), and the maximum rates of contraction and relaxation of the left ventricle; these effects were concentration dependent and reversible. Changes in ARIs, LVDP and the maximum rates of change of pressure lacked the steep response to 0.3 to 1.0 mM heptanol shown by the latency ... During premature stimulation protocols arrhythmias could be induced in hearts perfused with 0.1 to 0.3 mM heptanol but not at higher concentrations.",

The relationship of the hydroxylating process to protein concentration and to the formation of the three main alcoholic products, namely 1-heptanol (111706), 2-heptanol (543497), and 3-heptanol (589822), were linear up to 1mg/4 minutes. Treatment of rats with phenobarbitol (50066) for 2 days enhanced hydroxylation and formation of 2-heptanol, 3-heptanol and 4-heptanol about 4 fold, but 1-heptanol was increased only 60 percent. In contrast, 3,4-benzpyrene depressed the formation of 1-heptanol to about 70 percent and increased the formation of 3-heptanol and 4-heptanol slightly. Carbon-monoxide inhibited formation of 1-heptanol. Similar results were obtained with metyrapone.",

It is also a natural product found in plants, meats, fruits, vegetables and even in the expired air of healthy, unexposed people. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.216 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-heptanol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-heptanol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 28 hours. If released to soil, 1-heptanol is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 74. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.88X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Heptanol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data show theoretical 5 day BODs of 30% and 56.3% and 1 day theoretical BOD of 28.9%. If released into water, 1-heptanol is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Biodegradation half-lives of 0.2 days and 1.14 days where observed using activated sludge inoculum. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.2 days and 20 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 21 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1-heptanol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-heptanol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-heptanol via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing 1-heptanol.

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

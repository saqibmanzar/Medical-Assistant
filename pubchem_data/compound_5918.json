It was first discovered in Scotland in the 1970s and its clinical effectiveness for neuromuscular disorders, including Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), has been investigated in the 1980s. Amifampridine phosphate is a more stable salt that serves as an active ingredient of EMA-approved Firdapse, which was previously marketed as Zenas. It is currently used as the first-line symptomatic treatment for LEMS in adult patients and is ideally given as oral tablets in divided doses, three or four times a day. Firdapse (amifampridine) was formally approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adults with LEMS as recently as November of 2018.  LEMS is a rare auto-immune disorder of the neuromuscular junction that is characterized by proximal muscle weakness, depressed tendon reflexes, and posttetanic potentiation in addition to autonomic dysfunction. About 50-60% of the patients develop more rapidly progressive LEMS and small cell lung cancer, which influences the prognosis. Patients with LEMS develop serum antibodies against presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels, leading to decreased presynaptic calcium levels and reduced quantal release of acetylcholine, which is mainly responsible for causing symptoms of LEMS. Reduced acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction leads to decreased frequency of miniature endplate potentials of normal amplitude, and insufficient acetylcholine levels for the activation of postsynaptic muscle fibers following a single nerve impulse. This leads to the reduction of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP). Treatment for LEMS include immunotherapy such as conventional immunosuppression or intravenous immunoglobulins, however such treatments are recommended in patients in whom symptomatic treatment would not suffice. Amifampridine is the nonimmune treatment options for LEMS.   In phase III clinical trials of adult patients with LEMS, treatment of amifampridine significantly improved symptoms of LEMS compared to placebo with good tolerance. It was demonstrated in clinical studies involving healthy volunteers that the pharmacokinetics and systemic exposure to amifampridine is affected by the genetic differences in N-acetyl-transferase (NAT) enzymes (acetylator phenotype) and NAT2 genotype, which is subject to genetic variation. Slow acetylators were at higher risk for experiencing drug-associated adverse reactions, such as paresthesias, nausea, and headache.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In addition, it stimulated potassium-evoked dopamine and noradrenaline release in rat hippocampal slices and upregulate acetylcholine release in the brain. It may also potentiate adrenergic and cholinergic neuromuscular transmission in the gatrointestinal tract. In a single pharmacokinetic study, no effect was observed of amifampridine phosphate on cardiac repolarization as assessed using the QTc interval. There were no changes in heart rate, atrioventricular conduction or cardiac depolarization as measured by the heart rate, PR and QRS interval durations.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

A single oral dose of 20 mg amifampridine in fasted individuals resulted in mean peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) ranging from 16 to 137 ng/mL. Bioavailability is approximately 93-100% based on recoveries of unmetabolised amifampridine and a major 3-N-acetylated amifampridine metabolite in urine. Food consumption decreases amifampridine absorption and exposure with a decrease in the time to reach maximum concentrations (Tmax). It is approximated that food consumption lowers the Cmax on average by ~44% and lowers AUC by ~20%. based on geometric mean ratios.   Systemic exposure to amifampridine is affected by the overall metabolic acetylation activity of NAT enzymes and NAT2 genotype. The NAT enzymes are highly polymorphic that results in variable slow acetylator (SA) and rapid acetylator (RA) phenotypes. Slow acetylators are more prone to increased systemic exposure to amifampridine, and may require higher doses for therapeutic efficacy.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It selectively blocks presynaptic fast voltage-gated potassium channels, thereby prolonging cell membrane depolarization and action potential, and augmenting calcium transport into the nerve endings.

Amifampridine improves muscle strength and resting compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes with an overall weighted mean difference of 1.69 mV.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

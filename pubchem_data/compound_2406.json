This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Interference of these reactions perhaps deprives the fluke of the necessary quantity of energy for maintenance of life.",

(a) Bithionol has been used to some extent as an antibacterial agent in cosmetic preparations such as detergent bars, shampoos, creams, lotions, and bases used to hide blemishes. New evidence of clinical experience and photopatch tests indicate that bithionol is capable of causing photosensitivity in man when used topically and that in some instances the photosensitization may persist for prolonged periods as severe reactions without further contact with sensitizing articles. Also, there is evidence to indicate that bithionol may produce cross-sensitization with other commonly used chemicals such as certain halogenated salicylanilides and hexachlorophene. It is, therefore, the view of the Food and Drug Administration that bithionol is a deleterious substance which may render any cosmetic product that contains it injurious to users. Accordingly, any cosmetic containing bithionol is deemed to be adulterated under section 601(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  (b) Regulatory proceedings may be initiated with respect to any cosmetic preparation containing bithionol shipped within the jurisdiction of the act after March 15, 1968.",

Patch and photopatch tests were performed. As expected, ... positive photopatch tests to Ketum gel and ketoprofen 2.5% in petrolatum /were observed/ in all patients (100%). However, it was remarkable to note positive photopatch tests to other unexpected and non-relevant allergens, including fentichlor (67%), tetrachlorosalicylanilide (28%), triclosan (17%), tribromsalan (11%) and bithionol (11%) ... . these agents belong to the family of halogenated salicylanilides and related compounds, which have been forbidden in Europe since the 1970s. /The/ results raise the question of hyper-photosusceptibility to non-relevant allergens induced by photosensitivity to ketoprofen. The mechanism may involve the high photoreactivity induced by the association of a benzene ring with an oxygen group.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.1X10-9 mm Hg at 37 \u00b0C indicates bithionol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase bithionol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, bithionol is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2,000. The pKas of bithionol are 4.82 and 10.50, indicating it will exist primarily as an anion under environmental conditions and anions tend to have greater mobility in soils than neutral species. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not an important environmental fate process since anions do not volatilize. Bithionol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, bithionol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. However, adsorption to sediment may be lower than expected since bithionol exists primarily as an anion in water and anions may not adsorb as strongly to sediment as neutral species. Volatilization from water surfaces is not an important environmental fate process since anions do not volatilize. An estimated BCF of 284 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Bithionol is not expected to undergo hydrolysis due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions, but may be susceptible to direct photolysis in sunlit surface water since it absorbs light greater than 290 nm. Occupational exposure to bithionol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where bithionol is produced or used. Exposure to the general population may result due to biothionol's regulated use as an anthelmintic agent. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

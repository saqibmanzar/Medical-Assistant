Pyridostigmine bromide binds reversibly to acetylcholinesterase active sites in the peripheral nervous system, thereby preventing the breakdown of acetylcholine. This leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses and facilitates transmission of impulses across the neuromuscular junction. Mediated through muscarinic receptors, this agent increases contraction of bronchial and intestinal smooth muscle and the exocrine glands secretions, while it causes paralysis of the skeletal muscles mediated through nicotinic receptors. In addition, pyridostigmine is used as a reversible blocking agent to prevent organophosphates from binding to the acetylcholinesterase receptors and thereby protect the nervous system from the effects of nerve agents such as Soman.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

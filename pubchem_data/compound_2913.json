It is used (particularly as the hydrochloride sesquihydrate) for the relief of allergic conditions including rhinitis, conjunctivitis due to inhalant allergens and foods, urticaria and angioedema, and in pruritic skin disorders. Unlike other antihistamines, it is also a seratonin receptor antagonist, making it useful in conditions such as vascular headache and anorexia. It has a role as a H1-receptor antagonist, a serotonergic antagonist, an antipruritic drug, an anti-allergic agent and a gastrointestinal drug. It is a member of piperidines and a tertiary amine.",

It is a serotonin antagonist and a histamine H1 blocker used as antipruritic, appetite stimulant, antiallergic, and for the post-gastrectomy dumping syndrome, etc. Cyproheptadine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding. Cyproheptadine also competes with serotonin at receptor sites in smooth muscle in the intestines and other locations. Antagonism of serotonin on the appetite center of the hypothalamus may account for Cyproheptadine's ability to stimulate appetite.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The plasma CPH concn time course was subjected to biexponential calculation following the iv admin of CPH, producing the temporal and low plasma concn of desmethylcyproheptadine (DMCPH) and the sustained plasma concn of desmethylcyproheptadine epoxide (DMCPHepo). DMCPH was also eliminated according to the biexponential equation, after iv admin of performed DMCPH, forming DMCPHepo in plasma. On the other hand, no detectable DMCPHepo was found in plasma after the iv admin of cyproheptadine epoxide (CPHepo). All cmpd administered had large distribution volumes and were most entirely excreted as DMCPHepo in urine; this excretion continued for a long time. However, the urinary excretion pattern of DMCPHepo after CPHepo was different from those after CPH and MCPH. The mean residence times of the epoxidized metabolites estimated from the urinary data were much longer than those from the plasma concn data, suggesting either a gradual reflux of the metabolites from a tissue depot into systemic circulation under those plasma concn close of detection limit, or one interaction which delays excretion into the urine. This study suggests that both metabolic pathways of CPH, through DMCPH nd CPHepo, to DMCPHepo are possible, but that the demethylation largely occurs prior to epoxidation; also that the extensive and persistent distribution of DMCPHepo to tissues may relate to the toxicity of CPH reported in rats.",

The uptake of mepyramine was inhibited by various H1-antagonists. Ketotifen competitively inhibited mepyramine uptake, and lipophilic basic drugs significantly inhibited mepyramine uptake. The results indicated that H1-antagonists are transported across the blood brain barrier via a carrier mediated transport system common to lipophilic basic drugs.",

A full length cDNA encoding human UGTl.4 (the so-called minor human bilirubin UGT) was inserted into the expression vector pREP9 and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and stable transfectants were obtained after geneticin selection. As expected, the expressed protein had low catalytic activity toward bilirubin. However, expressed human UGTl.4 protein exhibited glucuronidation activity toward tertiary amine substrates, such as imipramine, cyproheptadine, tripelennamine, and chlorpromazine, which form quaternary ammonium linked glucuronides. Carcinogenic primary amines (beta-naphthylamine, benzidine, and 4-aminobiphenyl) also reacted with the expressed UGTl.4 protein at rates approximately 10-fold higher than the rates for quaternary ammonium glucuronide formation. Although a number of other UGT gene products are capable of catalyzing the glucuronidation of primary amine substrates, expressed human UGTl.4 protein is the only UGT isoform that has been shown to conjugate tertiary amine substrates, forming quaternary ammonium linked glucuronides.",

Stimulating effect of propranolol from the 9th to the 19th day of incubation and inhibitory effect of cyproheptadine from the 5th to the 19th day of incubation were revealed. These results indicate the existence of serotonin and noradrenaline in the amniotic fluid of chick embryo. High performance liquid chromatography directly confirmed this conclusion.",

Treatment with 10 ug CPH and selected structural analogs under culture conditions produced a progressive loss of cellular insulin which reached 30% of control within 24 hours. Comparison of the activities of the analogs 4-diphenylmethylpiperidine (4-DPMP) and 2-diphenylmethylpiperidine (2-DPMP) to produce cellular insulin depletion showed that 4-DPMP was as active as CPH but 2-DPMP had no activity at the highest concn employed (10 microM). The CPH metabolite desmethyl CPH-epoxide was five times more active than the parent compound in producing loss of insulin in RINm5F cells. These results are consistent with previously published results of CPH actions in vivo. An inhibition of insulin biosynthesis with no loss of preproinsulin mRNA occurred in RINm5F cells treated with CPH or DMCPH-epoxide. This suggests that an effect on transcription may not be the primary action by which CPH and its analogs inhibit insulin synthesis in vivo.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Previous efforts to validate this assay have used too few \"nonteratogens.\" The purpose of this study was to examine additional compounds, most of which, based on the literature were perceived to have low potential for developmental toxicity in vivo. In addition a method of data analysis was sought that would identify selective developmental toxins in the micromass assay i.e. those that are effective at dosages not maternally toxic. The concentration of each of 23 compounds that produced a 50% inhibition of radiolabeled thymidine and sulfate incorporation was determined and used to calculate a thymidine/sulfate ratio. The thymidine/sulfate ratio may be a useful measure of developmental hazard since thymidine incorporation measures toxicity toward a general cell function (DNA synthesis) and sulfate incorporation measures mainly toxicity toward a developmentally specific cell activity (chondroitin sulfate synthesis). All compounds tested produced thymidine/sulfate ratios of less than 2.0. Since 22 of these 23 compounds are classified as nonteratogens or nonselective developmental toxins in vivo a low thymidine/sulfate ratio in this in vitro assay system nay be capable of discriminating potential for developmental hazard in vivo.",

The endpoints selected in assessing the teratogenic potential of any agent (physical or chemical) involves detection of interference with normal muscle and/or neuron differentiation, induction of heat shock (stress) proteins, and inhibition of normal neurotransmitter levels. Current studies involve use of reporter gene technology (protein fusions) to identify teratogenicity. Results so far suggest that the Drosophila assay is capable of accurately establishing if a particular agent tested can act as a teratogen by a variety of appropriate endpoints (morphological, biochemical, molecular). Furthermore, this assay can be used not only as a teratogen screen, but also in mechanistic studies of abnormal development, gene involvement in teratogenic resistance, and the possible role of heat shock proteins in preventing birth defects."

We have investigated whether poly(ADP-ribose) may be Involved In glutamate neurotoxicity in vitro. Cerebellar granule cells at 12 days in culture when treated with a toxic dose of glutamate (100 uM) showed a rapid and transient increase of polyADP-ribose immunoreactivity. Cellular immunostaining was heterogeneous and returned to control levels after washout of glutamate. In the same cell preparations glutamate elicited a marked increase in enzyme protein immunoreactivity which persisted at later times. Non-toxic doses of glutamate did not affect immunostaining. In another set of experiments, poly(ADP-ribose) mRNA was increased 30 min after glutamate. In order to investigate the role of poly(ADP-ribose) in glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity structurally different inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) (3-aminobenzamide, benzamide, 3-aminophthalhydrazide) and their inactive analogues benzoic acid and phthalimide) were tested in this model. Addition of the inhibitors to cultures 60 min before and during the 30 min of glutamate treatment prevented neuronal death by 60-100%, assessed 24 hr later. Glutamate-induced calcium(2+) influx was not affected. Inactive analogues failed to afford neuroprotection. These data indicate that not only is poly(ADP-ribose) activated by the early possib1y calcium(2+)-mediated mechanisms initiated by glutamate but that it might also actively contribute to the subsequent neuronal death.",

Mortality, changes in body weight, or abnormal behavioral reactions were not observed in any animal at any dose level during the treatment period. Phthalimide did not induce changes in the following parameters at any dose level when treated animals were compared to controls: erythrocyte and leukocyte counts; hemoglobin; hematocrit; corpuscular volume; hemoglobin concentration; blood levels of urea nitrogen, alkaline phosphatase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase, and glucose; urine levels of glucose, albumin, and microscopic elements; urine pH. Lung weights were statistically significantly (test not specified, p < 0.05) lower in females in the 51 and 154 mg/m3 dose groups, while decreases were observed in lung weights (p < 0.01) and lung to body weight ratios (p < 0.05) in the 523 mg/m3 dose group females. The weights of the brain, gonads, heart, kidneys, liver, and spleen were not statistically significantly (p > 0.05) changed in any animal at any dose level compared to controls. Gross necropsy with histopathological examination of brain, gonads, heart, kidneys, liver, lung, spleen, lymph node, pituitary gland, and urinary bladder did not reveal any pathology in the 523 mg/m3 dose group; a single renal cortical adenoma observed in one male in the 523 mg/m3 dose group was not attributed to the effect of the test article.",

Further studies in which diamine oxidase iso1ated from wheat root tissues was incubated with the herbicides produced a good correlation between phytotoxic injury and degree of DAO inhibition.

Phthalimide has been detected in advanced treatment water. If released to soil, that phthalimide should have high mobility. The adsorptivity of phthalimide is expected to be sensitive to pH since phthalimide has a pKa of 8.3. Volatilization of phthalimide should not be important from moist or dry soil surfaces. Phthalimide may not be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces based on its lack of absorption of light at wavelengths >290 nm. According to two activated sludge biodegradation studies, phthalimide will biodegrade rapidly in soil and water. If released to water, phthalimide should not adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Phthalimide will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces. An estimated BCF value of 4.4 suggests that phthalimide will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. The half-lives for the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of phthalimide have been determined to be 1.6 days at a pH of 7, and 4 hours at a pH of 8. If released to the atmosphere, phthalimide will exist primarily in the particulate phase. Vapor-phase phthalimide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2.6 days. Particulate-phase phthalimide may be physically removed from the air by wet and dry deposition. (SRC)",

The adsorptivity of phthalimide is expected to be sensitive to pH since phthalimide has a pKa of 8.3(9). Volatilization of phthalimide should not be important from moist soil surfaces(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(4,SRC), or from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based on an estimated vapor pressure of 1X10-8 mm Hg(5,SRC).

The adsorptivity of phthalimide is expected to be sensitive to pH since phthalimide has a pKa of 8.3(8). Phthalimide will be essentially non-volatile from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(3). An estimated BCF value of 4.4(2,SRC), from an experimental log Kow(1), suggests that phthalimide will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a recommended classification scheme(4). The half-lives for the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of phthalimide have been determined to be 1.6 days at a pH of 7, and 4 hours at a pH of 8(5,SRC). According to two activated sludge biodegradation studies, phthalimide will biodegrade rapidly in water(6,7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

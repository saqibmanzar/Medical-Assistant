PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

These normal findings persisted after simultaneous adjustment for the effects of smoking, occupation, age, diabetes mellitus and a number of other potentially confounding factors. They are substantiated by the failure of the relative risk of bladder cancer to increase with increasing exposure to artificial sweeteners. Neither saccharin nor cyclamate is likely to be carcinogenic in man, at least at the moderate dietary ingestion levels reported by the patient sample.",

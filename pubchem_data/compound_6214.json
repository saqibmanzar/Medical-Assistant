It is also called HCE, perchloroethane, and carbon hexachloride. Its vapors smell like camphor. In the United States, about half of the hexachloroethane is used by the military for smoke-producing devices. It is also used to remove air bubbles in melted aluminum. Hexachloroethane may be present as an ingredient in some fungicides, insecticides, lubricants, and plastics. Hexachloroethane does not occur naturally in the environment. It is no longer made in the United States, but it is formed as a by-product in the production of some chemicals. Some hexachloroethane can be formed by incinerators when materials containing chlorinated hydrocarbons are burned. Hexachloroethane itself does not catch fire easily. Some hexachloroethane can also be formed when chlorine reacts with carbon compounds in drinking water.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The kidney concentration of HCE increased proportionately with dose in the males, but there were disproportionately small increases with dose in females. A group of male rats was given 62 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks to estimate tissue clearance. Clearance of HCE from fat, liver, kidney and blood occurred in an apparent first-order manner with a half-life of approximately 2.5 days. The apparent first-order elimination suggests that HCE metabolism and excretion were not saturated in rats given up to 62 mg/kg/day and suggests that, in the range of doses given, toxicity should be proportional to exposure concentration.",

A previously reported correlation between electronic parameters and dechlorination rate was not confirmed but rather a separate relationship between these parameters for each of three structural classes (RCH2Cl, RCHCl2, and RCCl3) was observed. On the basis of these observations, possible reaction mechanisms and their toxicological implications are discussed.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Hexachloroethane acts primarily as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant in humans acutely (short-term) exposed to it. Hexachloroethane is also moderately irritating to the skin, mucous membranes, and liver in humans. Neurological, liver, and kidney effects have been observed in animals exposed to hexachloroethane. No information is available on the chronic (long-term), reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of hexachloroethane in humans. Hepatocellular carcinomas (liver tumors) were observed in mice following oral exposure to hexachloroethane. EPA has classified hexachloroethane as a Group C, possible human carcinogen.",

Toxic by all routes (ie, inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this colorless crystalline substance may occur from its use as an inhibitor in explosives and pyrotechnics, as a vulcanizing agent, as a polymer additive, in the manufacture of smoke candles and grenades, and in metal refining. Effects from exposure may irritation of the mucous membranes, skin, lung and cornea, liver and kidney damage, and CNS depression. Also, it should be noted that the EPA Integrated Risk Assessment Information System (IRIS) has placed hexachloroethane on a list of substances that it considers possibly carcinogenic to humans. Both the OSHA PEL and the ACGIH TLV for hexachloroethane have been set at a TWA of 1 ppm. In activities or situations where over exposure may occur, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus, face shield, and impervious clothing. If contact should occur. immediately flush affected skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes, and remove contaminated clothing and shoes at the site. While hexachloroethane does not ignite easily, it may burn with the production of irritating and poisonous gases carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloroethylene. Fires involving hexachloroethane may be extinguished with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam. Hexachloroethane should be stored in cool, dark areas, away from alkalies and metals. Note this substance will attack some forms of plastics, rubber, and coatings. Shipping regulations and other DOT regulatory requirements should be consulted before transport. Small spills of hexachloroethane may be taken up with vermiculite, dry sand, earth, or other noncombustible absorbent, and placed into containers for later disposal. Hexachloroethane is a potential candidate for rotary kiln and fluidized bed forms of incineration. Before implementing land disposal of waste hexachloroethane, consult with regulatory agencies for guidance.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

This smoke was irritating to the animals and minor, acute inflammatory changes were seen in lung tissue. In contrast, Zn-HC smoke was very toxic and caused lethal injuries to the experimental animals, even at relatively low concentrations. Pulmonary injuries were extensive and death was due to blood congestion with pulmonary edema.

The testing was completed 5 weeks after production at a smoke munitions plant resumed following a 5-week break. Plasma hexachloroethane levels were 0.08 +/- 0.14 ug/L before production resumed and 7.3 +/-6.04 ug/L 5 weeks later indicating that despite protective equipment, low-level exposure occurred. Mild skin and mucous membrane irritation were reported in the exposed group, suggesting that exposure may have been through either the inhalation or dermal routes of exposure.",

For each species, 20 animals of each sex were placed on test as vehicle controls. ... Twenty animals of each sex were placed on test as untreated controls for each species. These animals were not intubated. ... /Under the conditions of this bioassay, no evidence was provided for the carcinogenicity of the cmpd in Osborne-Mendel rats. ... Hexachloroethane was carcinogenic in B6C3F1 mice, inducing hepatocellular carcinomas in both sexes. Levels of Evidence of Carcinogenicity: Male Rats: Negative; Female Rats: Negative; Male Mice: Positive; Female Mice: Positive.",

Three to four animals were sacrificed 0, 3, 6, 13, 22 and 33 days after the last day of treatment. Fat, liver, kidney and whole blood were taken for analysis. The highest concentration of HCE was found in the fat (303 +/- 50 ug/g). The concentration of HCE in the fat was approximately three times the concentration found in the kidney, and over 100 times that found in the liver and blood. HCE cleared from the fat, liver, kidney and blood in an apparent first order manner, with half-lives between 2-3 days. A second experiment evaluated the concentration of HCE in the tissues of male and female rats (4/sex/group) after receiving the test material for 111 days in the diet at a estimated concentration of 3, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day. The concentration of HCE in the male kidneys was higher than the female kidneys and the difference was most noticeable at the high dose level. As the dose rate increased, the relative increases in the levels of HCE was greater in the fat and less in the liver for both sexes.",

The three species tested yielded comparable acute EC50 values for Dalphnia magna, Dalphnia pulex and Ceriodaphnia reticulata varied twofold for hexachloroethane. Chronic EC50 values for the three species were within one order to magnitude for 2-chloroethanol, 2,4-pentanedione, cadmium, chromium and silver. Differences in the sensitivities of these three popular cladoceran test species were within one order of magnitude.

Its use as a military screening smoke will result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.4 mm Hg at 20 \u00b0C indicates hexachloroethane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase hexachloroethane does not contain functional groups that react with atmospheric oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals, nitrate radicals and ozone. Hexachloroethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, hexachloroethane is expected to have low to slight mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 1380 to 2360. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.89X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Hexachloroethane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The biodegradation half-life of hexachloroethane in a non-adapted aerobic sandy soil was reported as 25-48 days. If released into water, hexachloroethane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the range of Koc values. Hexachloroethane injected into a shallow sand aquifer was degraded with a half-life of 40 days in 10 \u00b0C groundwater under anaerobic conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 6 days, respectively. BCF values ranging from 1.0 to 708 suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to high. Hexachloroehtane was not hydrolyzed at pH 3, 7, and 11 at 85 \u00b0C, indicating hydrolysis will be a slow process in the environment under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to hexachloroethane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where hexachloroethane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to hexachloroethane via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

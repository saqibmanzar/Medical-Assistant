When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The mechanisms of fluoride toxicity on an immortalized cell line /was investigated/. Cells were cultured for 2, 6 or 24 hr in the presence of fluoride. Toxicity evaluation was based on: cell numbers, protein content, leucine-incorporation, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG) releases, Na-K-ATPase and Na-K-2Cl activities, electron microscope studies. ...  At 5 mmol after 24 hr, fluoride decreased cell numbers (-14%, *P < 0.05), protein content (-16%*), leucine incorporation (-54%*), Na-K-2Cl activity (-84%*), increased LDH (+145%*) and NAG release (+190%*). Na-K-ATPase was more sensitive and impaired from 1 mmol for 24hr and after 2 hr at 5 mmol. Crystal formation in mitochondria occurred after 6 hr at 5 mmol. Infra-red analysis and fluoride microdetermination established that crystals contained sodium, phosphate and fluoride. The results suggest that the Na-K-ATPase pump is a major target for fluoride toxicity in Henle's loop.",

Inhaled anesthetics act at many areas in the CNS. The Meyer-Overton theory suggests that the site of action of inhalation anesthetics may be the lipid matrix of neuronal membranes or other lipophilic sites. Anesthetics may cause changes in membrane thickness, which in turn affect the gating properties of ion channels in neurons. Interference with the hydrophobic portion of neuronal ion channel membrane proteins may be an important mechanism. /Inhalation anesthetics/"

Pituitary (PIT) and central nervous system (CNS) substance P (SP)-like and beta-endorphin (beta-end)-like immunoreactivities were evaluated immediately after anesthetic exposure (2 hr), after righting reflex (4 hr) or 24 hr postexposure (24 hr). Only halothane significantly reduced SP-like immunoreactivity in olfactory bulbs in both the 2-hr and 4-hr groups. Halothane elevated SP-like immunoreactivity of hippocampus at all three time periods, and in the hypothalamus at 2 hr. Both anesthetics significantly depleted thalamic concentrations of SP-like immunoreactivity. Methoxyflurane anesthesia resulted in a drastic decrease in SP-like immunoreactivity in PIT at all three time periods. ... Both anesthetics significantly decreased beta-end-like immunoreactivity in the olfactory bulbs and thalami at 2, 4, and 24 hr. ... Halothane significantly elevated PIT beta-end-like immunoreactivity at 2 and 24 hr, while methoxyflurane significantly lowered it in the 4-hr group, but elevated the levels of the same in the 24-hr group. Brain stem beta-end immunoreactivity were significantly reduced at 2 h by both anesthetics, and at 4 hr by methoxyflurane. Results indicate that halothane and methoxyflurane may differ significantly in their actions on SP and beta-end secreting neurons in the CNS.",

At the end of this period, half of the rats in each group were killed; the remainder breathed air only for a further four weeks (recovery period) before being killed. During the exposure period, growth of the methoxyflurane-exposed rats was markedly depressed, though food consumption was similar in the two groups. Both water consumption and urine volume were increased by methoxyflurane, possibly due to the nephrotoxic effect of fluoride, the concentration of which exceeded 50 micromolar in the sera of all exposed rats. At the end of the exposure period, livers of all exposed rats, but no controls, showed focal hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, and evidence of liver cell regeneration. Fatty change was prominent. During the recovery period, water consumption and urine volumes returned to near-normal levels. At the end of the recovery period, focal necrosis was still observed in the livers, although fatty change was no longer present. No histological abnormalities were observed in the kidneys of any rats.",

Methoxyflurane may still be produced in low quantities and used as a research chemical. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 49 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methoxyflurane will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methoxyflurane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 498 days. If released to soil, methoxyflurane is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 380. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-3 atm-cu m/mole. Methoxyflurane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. If released into water, methoxyflurane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 1.5 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Methoxyflurane contains functional groups that may be susceptible to hydrolysis; however, the rate of this potential reaction is not known. Occupational exposure to methoxyflurane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methoxyflurane is still produced or used. The general population is not expected to be exposed to this compound since it was primarily used as an anesthetic and this use has been discontinued. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

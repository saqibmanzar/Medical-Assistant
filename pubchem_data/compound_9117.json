When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Using recently developed metabolic toxicity screening arrays and a biocolloid reactor-LC-MS/MS approach, both featuring films of DNA and human metabolic enzymes, we demonstrated the relatively low reactivity of metabolically activated benzo[ghi]perylene (B[ghi]P) toward DNA. Electro-optical toxicity screening arrays showed that B[ghi]P metabolites damage DNA at a 3-fold lower rate than benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), whose metabolites have a strong and well-understood propensity for DNA damage. Metabolic studies using magnetic bead biocolloid reactors coated with microsomal enzymes in 96-well plates showed that cyt P450s 1A1 and 1B1 provide high activity for B[ghi]P and B[a]P conversion. Consistent with published results, the major metabolism of B[ghi]P involved oxidations at 3,4 and 11,12 positions, leading to the formation of B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide and B[ghi]P 3,4,11,12-bisoxide. B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide was synthesized and reacted with deoxyadenosine at N6 and N7 positions and with deoxyguanosine at the N2 position. B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide is hydrolytically unstable and transforms into the 3,4-diol or converts to 3- or 4-hydroxy B[ghi]P. LC-MS/MS of reaction products from the magnetic biocolloid reactor particles coated with DNA and human enzymes revealed for the first time that a major DNA adduct results from the reaction between B[ghi]P 3,4,11,12-bisoxide and deoxyguanosine. Results also demonstrated 5-fold lower formation rates of the major DNA adduct for B[ghi]P metabolites compared to B[a]P. Overall, results from both the electro-optical array and biocolloid reactor-LC-MS/MS consistently suggest a lower human genotoxicity profile of B[ghi]P than B[a]P.",

Benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP) represents the group of PAHs lacking such a \"classic\" bay region and hence cannot be metabolically converted like BaP to bay region dihydrodiol epoxides considered as ultimate mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolites of PAH. BghiP exhibits bacterial mutagenicity in strains TA98 (1.3 his(+)-revertant colonies/nmol) and TA100 (4.3 his(+)-revertant colonies/nmol) of Salmonella typhimurium after metabolic activation by the postmitochondrial hepatic fraction of CD rats treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. Inhibition of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) with 1,1,1-trichloro-2-propene oxide raised the bacterial mutagenicity of BghiP in TA98 almost 4-fold indicating arene oxides as ultimate mutagens. To confirm this assumption, the biotransformation of BghiP was elucidated. Incubation of BghiP with liver microsomes of CD rats treated with Aroclor 1254 yielded 17 ethyl acetate extractable metabolic products. Twelve metabolites were identified by a combination of chromatographic, spectroscopic, and biochemical methods. The microsomal biotransformation of BghiP proceeds by two pathways: Pathway I starts with the monooxygenase attack at the 7-position leading to the 7-phenol, which is transformed to the 7,8- and 7,10-diphenols followed by oxidation to the 7,8- and 7,10-quinones. On pathway II, the K regions of BghiP are successively converted to arene oxides yielding the indirectly identified 3,4-oxide and the 3,4,11,12-bisoxides. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the 3,4-oxide leads to the trans-3,4-dihydrodiol, which is oxidized to the 3,4-quinone. Similarly, the trans-3,4-trans-11,12-bisdihydrodiols and the trans-3,4-dihydrodiol 11,12-quinone are generated from the 3,4,11,12-bisoxides. The trans-3,4-dihydrodiol and the trans-3,4-trans-11,12-bisdihydrodiols are preferentially formed as R,R and R,R,R,R enantiomers, respectively. The intrinsic bacterial mutagenicity of the 3,4,11,12-bisoxides is rather low and hardly explains the strong increase in bacterial mutagenicity of BghiP after inhibition of mEH. Thus, we believe that the 3,4-oxide plays a more important role as the ultimate mutagenic metabolite of BghiP.",

These cells lack the enzymes necessary to convert PAHs to DNA-binding metabolites. ... 11 PAHs, i.e., benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), benz[a]anthracene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 3-methylcholanthrene, fluoranthene, anthanthrene, 11H-benzo[b]fluorene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, pyrene, benzo[ghi]perylene and benzo[e]pyrene caused DNA strand breaks even without external metabolic activation, while naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and naphthacene were inactive. When the comet assay was performed in the dark or when yellow fluorescent lamps were used for illumination the DNA-damaging effect of the 11 PAHs disappeared. White fluorescent lamps exhibit emission maxima at 334.1, 365.0, 404.7, and 435.8 nm representing spectral lines of mercury. In the case of yellow fluorescent lamps these emissions were absent. Obviously, under standard laboratory illumination many PAHs are photo-activated, resulting in DNA-damaging species. This feature of PAHs should be taken into account when these compounds are employed for the initiation of skin cancer. ...",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: In human cells BghiP can activate the overexpression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and cytochrome CYP4B1, and the effects are abated by the AhR receptor antagonist. BghiP represents the group of PAHs lacking a \"classic\" bay region and hence it cannot be metabolically converted to bay region dihydrodiol epoxides considered as ultimate mutagenic and carcinogenic metabolites of PAH. Experimental results demonstrate lower human genotoxicity profile of B[ghi]P than for benzo[a]pyrene. ANIMAL STUDIES: Benzo(ghi)perylene showed no tumorigenic effect in the respiratory tracts of rats when given at doses of 5 mg. BghiP was analyzed for induction effect on skin and liver aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and 7-ethoxycoumarin o-deethylase activities in neonatal rats. A single topical application caused induction of liver enzymes without producing effects on skin enzymes. BghiP exhibits bacterial mutagenicity in strains TA98 and TA100 of Salmonella typhimurium after metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: BghiP was responsible for retardation of growth and increases in adrenal and nasal gland weight in nestling herring gulls (Larus argentatus).",

In this study, human hepatoma HepG2 cells cotreated with benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and benzo[g,h,i]perylene (BghiP) were used as a model to investigate the cocarcinogenic mechanism of BghiP in BaP-induced carcinogenesis. DNA adduct formation is thought to initiate carcinogenesis, so the effect of BghiP on BaP-DNA adduct formation was evaluated using a (32)P-postlabeling assay. The BaP-DNA adduct levels increased following the addition of BghiP, in a dose-dependent manner. However, no adducts were formed with BghiP alone. /A/ previous report showed that cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is responsible for the metabolic activation of BaP and the formation of B[a]P adduct in HepG2 cells. Western blot and Northern blot analyses were used to evaluate whether BaP-induced CYP1A1 protein and mRNA levels increased following the addition of BghiP. Our data showed that BghiP enhanced BaP-induced CYP1A1 protein and its mRNA levels. To understand whether BghiP enhances BaP-induced CYP1A1 gene expression through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway, a gel retardation assay was performed to elucidate the synergistic mechanism of BghiP in BaP-induced CYP1A1 gene expression. The results showed that BghiP causes an increase in the nuclear accumulation of AhR in cells and/or activation of AhR to a DNA-binding form. There was a concordant increase in the transcription activation of CYP1A1 gene and the induction of AhR signal pathway. Our findings demonstrated that BghiP enhances BaP-induced CYP1A1 transcription by AhR activation and suggested that the induction mechanism of CYP1A1 contributes to the cocarcinogenic potential of BghiP in BaP-induced carcinogenesis.",

When MNNG was added to logarithmically growing cultures and TPA was added 2, 24, or 48 hr later, no changes in SCE frequency relative to MNNG alone occurred. Similar results were obtained with TPA in cells that had been exposed to MNNG in stationary growth phase. Whereas no transformation occurred with TPA alone and pretreatment with TPA did not affect MNNG transformation, its addition 2 hr after MNNG reduced transformation frequency but addition 24-72 hr after MNNG increased the transformation frequency up to 6-fold. TPA had a minimal effect on increasing the transformation frequency (2-fold) induced by MNNG at 0.25 ug/mL, a high concentration. Of three polycyclic hydrocarbons, perylene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, and benz[a]anthracene, known as weak or noncarcinogens, only benz[a]anthracene induced a very low transformation frequency; however, after TPA, transformation occurred with all three. Because the number of cells whose transformation was initiated by low doses of carcinogen is much larger than the number of cells giving rise to transformed colonies in the absence of TPA, the frequency of the initial event is greater than can be expected from point mutations. Furthermore, the promotional aspect of transformation is not accompanied by a parallel increase in SCE.",

These cells lack the enzymes necessary to convert PAHs to DNA-binding metabolites. ... 11 PAHs, i.e., benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), benz[a]anthracene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, 3-methylcholanthrene, fluoranthene, anthanthrene, 11H-benzo[b]fluorene, dibenz[a,h]anthracene, pyrene, benzo[ghi]perylene and benzo[e]pyrene caused DNA strand breaks even without external metabolic activation, while naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and naphthacene were inactive. When the comet assay was performed in the dark or when yellow fluorescent lamps were used for illumination the DNA-damaging effect of the 11 PAHs disappeared. White fluorescent lamps exhibit emission maxima at 334.1, 365.0, 404.7, and 435.8 nm representing spectral lines of mercury. In the case of yellow fluorescent lamps these emissions were absent. Obviously, under standard laboratory illumination many PAHs are photo-activated, resulting in DNA-damaging species. This feature of PAHs should be taken into account when these compounds are employed for the initiation of skin cancer. ...",

Urine and semen samples were collected from a total of 65 healthy coke oven workers. Sperm quality parameters (concentration, motility, vitality, and morphology) and semen integrity (DNA fragmentation, 8-oxodGuo, bulky DNA adducts) were analyzed. Sixteen (16) targeted PAHs at the personal breathing zone area were monitored and quantified. Results showed that urinary 1-OHP positively correlated with measured levels of 16 targeted PAHs. Urinary 1-OHP did not significantly correlate with semen quality; however, PAHs with heavy molecular weight, e.g., benzo(g,h,i)perylene and benzo(k)fluoranthene, negatively correlated with morphology and motility of sperms (p = 0.02 and 0.002, p = 0.04 and 0.04, respectively). Urinary 1-OHP positively correlated with the level of 8-oxodGuo and bulky DNA adducts, but not DNA fragmentation. Urinary 1-OHP was a suitable biomarker for an estimate of biologically effective doses of PAH exposure. However, urinary 1-OHP may not be sufficient as a biomarker to assess both cellular and molecular changes of sperm induced by PAHs.",

Using recently developed metabolic toxicity screening arrays and a biocolloid reactor-LC-MS/MS approach, both featuring films of DNA and human metabolic enzymes, we demonstrated the relatively low reactivity of metabolically activated benzo[ghi]perylene (B[ghi]P) toward DNA. Electro-optical toxicity screening arrays showed that B[ghi]P metabolites damage DNA at a 3-fold lower rate than benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), whose metabolites have a strong and well-understood propensity for DNA damage. Metabolic studies using magnetic bead biocolloid reactors coated with microsomal enzymes in 96-well plates showed that cyt P450s 1A1 and 1B1 provide high activity for B[ghi]P and B[a]P conversion. Consistent with published results, the major metabolism of B[ghi]P involved oxidations at 3,4 and 11,12 positions, leading to the formation of B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide and B[ghi]P 3,4,11,12-bisoxide. B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide was synthesized and reacted with deoxyadenosine at N6 and N7 positions and with deoxyguanosine at the N2 position. B[ghi]P 3,4-oxide is hydrolytically unstable and transforms into the 3,4-diol or converts to 3- or 4-hydroxy B[ghi]P. LC-MS/MS of reaction products from the magnetic biocolloid reactor particles coated with DNA and human enzymes revealed for the first time that a major DNA adduct results from the reaction between B[ghi]P 3,4,11,12-bisoxide and deoxyguanosine. Results also demonstrated 5-fold lower formation rates of the major DNA adduct for B[ghi]P metabolites compared to B[a]P. Overall, results from both the electro-optical array and biocolloid reactor-LC-MS/MS consistently suggest a lower human genotoxicity profile of B[ghi]P than B[a]P.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects in vitro of benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP) on the NL-20 cell line. Results showed that BghiP induced the formation of small vesicles throughout the cytoplasm, with absence of nuclear fragmentation. At 48hr exposition, damage in cell membrane increased significantly at 1.24 ug/mL of BghiP (p<0.05). Immunocytochemistry revealed that BghiP provokes nuclear translocation of AhR receptor, which indicates that this compound can induce transcription of genes via receptor binding (AhR pathway activation). BghiP induced a two-fold increase (p<0.05) in the expression of AhR and CYP4B1 (a lung-specific pathway effector). In the presence of the receptor antagonist CH-223191, the loss of viability, the nuclear translocation and the overexpression of genes decreased, though this did not prevent the formation of vesicles. BghiP induced oxidative stress and in presence of the receptor antagonist this increased significantly. In conclusion, BghiP can activate the overexpression of AhR and CYP4B1, and the effects are abated by the AhR receptor antagonist. ...",

Benzo(ghi)perylene has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke, sidestream cigarette smoke, mainstream of marijuana cigarettes, emissions from burning various types of coal, fresh and used motor oils, gasolines, charcoal-broiled steaks, and smoked and cooked food. Benzo(ghi)perylene is released to the environment in incinerator stack emission, industrial wastewaters, exhaust from gasoline and diesel engines and emissions from the burning of wood, biofuels, coal and tires. There is no commercial production or known use for benzo(ghi)perylene. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.0X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates benzo(ghi)perylene will exist primarily in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. However, a small percentage will exist is the vapor phase. Both vapor-phase and particulate-phase benzo(ghi)perylene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for each of these reactions in air is estimated to be 4.4-4.5 hours. Particulate-phase benzo(ghi)perylene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Benzo(ghi)perylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, benzo(ghi)perylene is expected to have no mobility based upon Koc values of 6.3X10+6 and 4.1X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.31X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Benzo(ghi)perylene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Soil degradation studies have found that benzo(ghi)perylene degrades slowly with half-lives ranging from 173 to 863 days. If released into water, benzo(ghi)perylene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 11,000 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to benzo(ghi)perylene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where benzo(ghi)perylene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzo(ghi)perylene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing benzo(ghi)perylene. Since benzo(ghi)perylene is a product of incomplete combustion, occupational situations involving heating organic material may potentially result in exposure to this compound through inhalation of air particulate matter and dermal contact with combustion products.

Volatilization of benzo(ghi)perylene from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 3.31X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(4). Benzo(ghi)perylene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 1X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). In general, PAHs with five or more benzene rings do not biodegrade readily(6). Biodegradation of PAHs having five or more rings, including benzo(ghi)perylene, was slight to non-existent in three soils under field conditions(7). Soil degradation studies have found that benzo(ghi)perylene degrades slowly with half-lives ranging from 173 to 863 days(8-10). Benzo(ghi)perylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(11) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 3.31X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 11,000(SRC), from its log Kow of 6.63(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(9). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.1 days has been reported for the analogous compound benzo(a)pyrene(10). In general, PAHs with five or more benzene rings do not biodegrade readily(11). Biodegradation of PAHs having five or more rings, including benzo(ghi)perylene, was slight to non-existent in three soils under field conditions(12). A laboratory study using acclimated water and sediment from the Yellow River found that water high in sediment content could biodegrade benzo(ghi)perylene(13).",

Based on an estimated super-cooled vapor pressure of 3.2X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3), a small percentage of benzo(ghi)perylene is expected to exist in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere(1). Ambient monitoring studies have detected benzo(ghi)perylene in both the particulate and vapor phases(4,5). Vapor-phase benzo(ghi)perylene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.4 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 8.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase benzo(ghi)perylene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.5 hours(SRC), calculated from a measured rate constant of 8.5X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(6). Particulate-phase benzo(ghi)perylene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Benzo(ghi)perylene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

After 5 weeks of incubation, benzo(ghi)perylene was approximately 18% degraded from a soil sample collected at a former manufactured gas plant site(2). A study in which polyaromatic hydrocarbon contaminated sludge was applied to 4 soil samples collected in Lancaster, England resulted in biodegradation half-lives of 460, 365, 460, and 535 days for benzo(ghi)perylene(3). A long term field study in which polyaromatic hydrocarbon contaminated sludge was applied to agricultural plots in England resulted in average biodegradation half-lives of 9.1 and 9.5 years for benzo(ghi)perylene(4). Eighty-one and 76% of an initial concentration of 9.96 ug/g benzo(ghi)perylene remained after 240 days in an unacclimated agricultural sandy loam soil incubated at 10 and 20 \u00b0C, respectively; corresponding half-lives were estimated to be about 650 and 600 days(5). After 1,280 days, 78.3% of an initial concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene at 3.1 ug/g remained in a soil treated with oil sludge at a concentration of 17.0 ug/g(6). Biodegradation of PAHs having five or more rings, including benzo(ghi)perylene, was slight to non-existent in three soils under field conditions(7). Laboratory studies using sediment and water from the Yellow River, China, known to be contaminated with PAHs, found that biodegradation rates of benzo(ghi)perylene increased as the suspended sediment content of the water was increased(8); the bacteria population on the sediment was found to be far greater than in the water phase alone(8); a biodegradation rate approaching 50% was reached over a 30-day incubation period using the highest sediment contents(8).",

However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.1 days has been reported for the analogous compound benzo(a)pyrene(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The Koc of benzo(ghi)perylene in 16 historically contaminated sediments ranged from 2.7X10+5 to 8.1X10+8 with a median of 1.3X10+7(3). According to a classification scheme(4), these Koc values suggest that benzo(ghi)perylene is expected to be immobile in soil. The log Kdoc (partition coefficient for sorption to dissolved organic carbon) of benzo(ghi)perylene was reported to range from 6.93 to 7.08; the log Kpoc (partition coefficient for sorption to particulate organic material was reported to be 6.8(5). The partition coefficient for sorption to dissolved organic carbon, Kdoc, of benzo(ghi)perylene to water-soluble soil organic matter in loam sand (from Newmarkt, Germany agriculture), clay loam (from Allersdorf, Germany forest), and humic acid (Aldrich) were determined to be 85710, 109570, and 614900, respectively(6).",

The average concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in the surface water and bottom water of samples collected from October 1990 to August 1992 in the Chesapeake Bay was determined to be 0.88 and 1.50 ng/L, respectively(2). Benzo(ghi)perylene was identified as having a concentration <0.008 ug/L in the surface waters of Alessandria District, southeastern Piedmont, Italy during the winter 1989-1990(3). A 15 year study of about 70 lakes, 30 rivers, and 15 gulfs and bays of the Baltic Sea of the Estonian SSR was found to contain an average benzo(ghi)perylene concentration of 0.0102 ug/L (42.7%) in water(4). Benzo(ghi)perylene is listed as a contaminant of Great Lakes Ontario, Erie, Michigan and Superior including Lake St Clair(5). As of 1985, benzo(ghi)perylene had a median concentration less than 10 ug/L and tested positive in 1.0% of 914 ambient waters in surface waters from EPA's STORET database(6). Benzo(ghi)perylene was detected at 2 of 4 sampling stations along the Mississippi River at an average concentration of 7 ng/L(7). Water sampled from the Menderes River, Turkey in 2003 contained benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations of below detection limits to (0.92 ng/L) 0.7 ug/L(8). Sampling of water from the Coral Reef of southern Taiwan between 2006-2007 detected benzo(ghi)perylene in both the dissolved phase and in the particulate phase of the water(9). Benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 ng/L in six stations located in the Guanabara Bay Basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, sampled from September 2011 to August 2012(10).",

The concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in precipitation collected 50 km north of Minneapolis, MN in 1986 was determined to range from 1.4 to 2.2 ng/L(2). The average concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in snow, winter rain, spring rain, summer rain, and fog samples collected in Dubendorf, Switzerland in 1986 was 34, 13, 4.1, 3.7, and 1860 ng/L(3). The concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in ice samples taken during the summer of 1991 at the center of Greenland was determined to range from 8 to 117 pg/g(4). Benzo(ghi)perylene was identified in cloud/rain water samples collected spring 1991 in the Vosges mountains, France in concentrations ranging from 3 to 475 ng/L(5). Benzo(ghi)perylene (31%) was identified in the total rain collected on August 11, 1992 in Chesapeake Bay, MD(6). Rain water in Witteveen, de Bilt, Vlissingen and Biest-houtakker, Netherlands contained benzo(ghi)perylene at concentrations up to 125, 145, 142 and 241 ng/L with average concentrations of 39, 68, 61 and 55 ng/L, respectively(7). Rainwater collected in Singapore between 2007-2008 had benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations of 2.2 and 18.8 ng/L in the particle and dissolved phases respectively(8).",

A power plant in Boston, MA emitted benzo(ghi)perylene to the ambient air at an estimated concentration of 5.2X10-7 ug/cu m(3). The benzo(ghi)perylene concentration in the emission from furnaces fueled with cereal straw or wood chips was determined to range from 0.005 to 63.2 ug/cu m(4). Weathered bottom ash collected from four municipal waste incinerators in Sweden in 1996 had benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations of 3.6-49 ug/kg(5).

Benzo(ghi)perylene was identified in sediment collected near various industrial emission sources on the Swedish Baltic Coast, concentration not reported(2). Bed sediments collected in 1993 at 16 sites along the Lauritzen Canal and Richmond Harbor, California were found to contain benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations ranging from 160 to 1250 ng/g(3). Sediment samples of various parts of Lake Lagoda, Russia collected in June 1993 were found to contain benzo(ghi)perylene ranging in concentrations from 1.9 to 230 ng/g(4). Sediment samples collected from four sites in Lake Superior during 1984-1985 were found to contain average benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations of 106.8 ng/g in surficial sediments, 61 ng/g in unstratified sediment, and 104 ng/g in surface water suspended solids(5). The concentrations of benzo(ghi)perylene in 30 sediment samples collected at 15 different sites from the Gulf of Lion, France ranged from not detected to 314.5 ng/g(6). The level of benzo(ghi)perylene contained in 213 sediment samples from 58 sediment cores collected throughout the Newark Bay Estuary, New Jersey from December 1991 to March 1993 ranged from 0.33 to 57 mg/kg(7). Benzo(ghi)perylene was identified in 81 sediment cores collected from the Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario from April to July 1989 with concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 60.6 ug/g(8).",

A sample of sandy loam soil contaminated 40 years previously was collected at a site in southern New Jersey and was found to contain 31.4 ug/g benzo(ghi)perylene(2). The average concentration of pyrene detected in soil samples collected from July 21-23, 1992 from 3 northeastern US cities was 0.89 mg/kg(3). Various sites at the Los Alamos National Laboratory were sampled; soil analysis revealed that the level of benzo(ghi)perylene ranged from 0.37 to 81.9 mg/kg(4). The level of benzo(ghi)perylene in soil samples collected from the Rothamsted Experimental Station in southeast England since the mid-1800s up to 1988 show a concentration trend of 22, 8.3, 6.1, 55, and 66 ng/g in the years 1846, 1881, 1914, 1956, and 1980, respectively(5). The average concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in soil samples collected at 49 sites in Wales was determined to be 137 ug/kg(6). Soil samples collected from a variety of vegetable field areas of the Pearl River Delta, South China in 2002 contained benzo(ghi)perylene levels ranging from not detectable to 43 ug/kg(7).

The average concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in the atmosphere of a street, a park, and a bus street in Copenhagen, Denmark was measured at 8.0, 1.5, and 0.55 ng/cu m, respectively, during 1992-1994 monitoring(2). Early 1990s seasonal sampling at an urban site in Birmingham, England contained 1.97 ng/cu m benzo(ghi)perylene in winter and 0.76 ng/cu m in summer; seasonal sampling at a rural site in South Kensington, England contained 0.21 ng/cu-m benzo(ghi)perylene in summer(3); benzo(ghi)perylene in summer was primarily detected in the particulate phase, but small amounts were detected in the vapor phase(3). 70 samples of airborne particulates were sampled from two sites in Thessaloniki, Greece during a 1 year period starting in July 1987; the average benzo(ghi)perylene concentration was determined to be 8.0 ng/cu-m at both sites(4). Aerosol samples collected at six sites in Hong Kong during the winter months of 1993 were found to contain benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations ranging from 193 to 4742 pg/cu m(5). The 1989-1990 seasonal concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in the atmosphere of Barcelona, Spain was determined to be 8.79, 4.73, 5.93, and 5.97 ng/cu-m in spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively(6). In a long-term air monitoring study of four urban United Kingdom areas sampled throughout 1991, the concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene ranged from 0.6 to 2.3 ng/cu m(7). Air monitoring conducted at two stations in Hong Kong between 1998-2005 detected average benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations ranging from 0.14-1.08 ng/cu m(8). Air monitoring conducted at 9 stations in Hanoi, Vietnam in the early 2000s found average benzo(ghi)perylene particulate phase and gas phase concentrations of 8.3 and 0.40 ng/cu m respectively(9). Air monitoring conducted at 17 sites in the United Kingdom between 1999 to 2007 detected benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations ranging from 0.034 to 2.5 ng/cu m(10). Quarterly air monitoring conducted at 8 sites in the United Kingdom during 2009 detected benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations ranging from 0.0068 to 1.4 ng/cu m(10).",

The average concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in ten different homes in Columbus, OH ranged from 0.36 to 2.26 ng/cu m(2). The level of benzo(ghi)perylene in 250 homes in Kenya using open fires to cook was determined to be a minimum of 30 ng/cu m and a maximum of 770 ng/cu m(3). Benzo(ghi)perylene was detected in the air of homes in China at concentration of 0.08-24 ug/cu m(4). The concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in house dust samples collected from homes in Columbus, OH during the 1992-1993 heating season ranged from 6.89 ppm to 7.49 ppm(5). The concentration of benzo(ghi)perylene in indoor air from unvented kerosene heater emissions in mobile homes was determined to be 0.22 ng/cu m with the heater off and 3.7 ng/m with the heater on(6). The level of benzo(ghi)perylene in the homes of Ahmedabad, India using cattle dung, cattle dung+wood, and wood as cooking fuel was determined to be 263, 259, and 194 ng/cu m, respectively(7). Indoor air samples collected in homes in Kuwait in 2004 detected benzo(ghi)perylene in 29% of all samples at amounts ranging from below detection limits to 623 ug/cu m(8). Monitoring of indoor air in wood-burning Swedish homes in 2003 found a mean benzo(ghi)perylene level of 0.49 ng/cu m(9).",

Monitoring at the Venice Lagoon, Italy in 2005 identified a mean dry deposition flux of benzo(ghi)perylene of 5.9 ng/sq m/day(4). House dust samples collected from homes in Ottawa, Canada during 2002-2003 sampling detected median and mean benzo(ghi)perylene concentrations of 0.793 and 2.79 ug/g respectively(5).",

The total concentrations of 17 PAHs (summation operator PAHs) in the chamber were 3500 and 1152 ng/cu m in vapor phase and particulate phase, respectively. In vapor phase, the yield of naphthalene (NA) appeared to be the most abundant (2462 ng/cig) followed by fluorene (FLUOR) and acenaphthylene (ACY), while the yield of benzo[ghi]perylene (BP) was the most abundant (259.7 ng/cig) in particulate phase followed by phenanthrene (PHEN) and FLUOR. The proportion of PAHs in particulate phase increased with increasing molecular weight. PAHs with two to six rings accounted for 40.2%, 35.3%, 11.7%, 7.6%, 5.2% of summation operator PAHs, respectively. There was no obvious correlation between PAHs, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) concentrations in tobacco smoke and smoking tar contents, nicotine contents. With the source fingerprint of PAHs in tobacco smoke, NA could be regarded as the marker of tobacco smoke source because of its largest contribution to summation operator PAHs (40.2%), followed by FLUOR (12.7%) and ACY (9.8%). Further study indicated that more than 80% of BaP in indoor air of resident homes in Hangzhou was from tobacco smoke. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

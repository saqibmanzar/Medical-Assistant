When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The systemic availability of methysergide was only 13%, most probably due to a high degree of first-pass metabolism to methylergometrine. We also found evidence of extrahepatic clearance of methysergide. After oral administration the plasma concentrations of the metabolite were considerably higher than those of the parent drug and the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) for methylergometrine was more than ten times greater than for methysergide. /These/ findings may be relevant to the treatment of migraine if methylergometrine contributes to the effect of methysergide. Methylergometrine had a significantly longer elimination half-life than methysergide (223 +/- 43 min vs 62.0 +/- 8.3 min and 174 +/- 35 min vs 44.8 +/- 8.1 min in the oral and intravenous studies respectively).",

MS was administered iv in doses of 0.71 (0.25 mg/kg) or 2.8 mumol/kg (1.0 mg/kg). The metabolite MEM was administered as iv doses of 0.74 (0.25 mg/kg) or 2.9 mumol/kg (1.0 mg/kg). The steady state characteristics of these compounds were also studied after constant rate iv infusion of MS at two different rates, 0.70 and 14.0 nmol/min per kg. Plasma protein binding and blood/plasma partitioning for MS were determined over a range of concentrations. Plasma and blood concentrations of MS and MEM were measured by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The plasma clearance of MS was high and ranged from 74.2-102 mL/min per kg. The two iv doses of MS were not equivalent after dose correction; clearance, volume of distribution at steady-state and terminal half-life were significantly greater for the higher dose. Plasma clearance from the two iv infusions of MS were in accordance with that from the lower iv dose. Protein binding as well as the plasma/blood partitioning, of MS was constant over the range of concentrations observed in the disposition studies, averaging 84.2% and 1.67%, respectively. The metabolite MEM had a plasma clearance five to six times lower than that of the parent drug but a similar volume of distribution at steady state. The formation of MEM after MS administration was relatively low and appeared to be saturable since the formation clearance of MEM decreased significantly from 3.5 to 1.9 mL/min per kg for the low and the high rate of iv infusion of MS, respectively.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Here /investigators/ asked whether systemic (i.p.) and intrathecal (i.t.) administrations of a nonselective serotonergic antagonist, methysergide, might produce paradoxical antinociception similar to naloxone in the mouse formalin test. A diluted formalin solution was injected into the mouse plantar region of the hind paw and the duration of licking responses was measured at periods of 0-5 min (1st phase) and 20-40 min (2nd phase) after formalin injection. Methysergide administered i.p. and i.t. showed an attenuated licking duration only in the 2nd phase. The effect observed in the 2nd phase was reversed in the 5,7-dihydroxytriptamine, but not N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine pretreated group of mice, suggesting that descending serotonergic, but not noradrenergic, systems are involved in the methysergide antinociception. To further investigate the mechanism by which methysergide inhibited the nociceptive behaviors induced by formalin, the antinociceptive effect of methysergide was also tested in substance P (i.t.) and excitatory amino acids (i.t.), such as glutamate, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid, and kainic acid, which are major components in the formalin-induced nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord pain models. The duration of nociceptive behaviors shown in these models was significantly shortened by i.p. and i.t. administration of methysergide. These results suggest that methysergide also produces a paradoxical antinociception in various pain models including the formalin test, similar to the results of naloxone.",

So far there is no means of preventing these CGRP-induced ocular effects. In the present study, the effect of intravenous methysergide (1-10 mg kg-1, b.w.) on CGRP-induced changes in the IOP, blood-aqueous barrier and cyclic AMP content in the aqueous humour was studied in vivo. The effect of methysergide on CGRP-induced vasodilatation both in vivo and in vitro was also investigated. Methysergide decreased intraocular pressure but had only a transient effect on blood pressure. Methysergide decreased the regional blood flow in ocular tissues by 53-65%, but did not have such a vasoconstrictor effect in most extra-ocular tissues studied. Methysergide inhibited CGRP-induced vasodilatation, increase in the IOP, breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier and increase in the cyclic AMP content in the aqueous humour in vivo. In vitro, methysergide alone did not have effects on the vascular tone in isolated ophthalmic artery of rabbit. However, it potentiated noradrenaline (NA)-induced contraction. There were no differences in the IC50 values for CGRP on the NA-induced contraction in the presence and absence of methysergide, indicating that methysergide has no direct effect on the vasorelaxant effect of CGRP in vitro. The present study demonstrates that in the rabbit eye methysergide inhibits CGRP-induced changes. One inhibitory mechanism of methysergide may be to enhance the effect of a vasoconstrictor (NA) to antagonize the vasodilator effect of CGRP. The present findings suggest that a methysergide-sensitive mechanism may be used to limit some pathophysiological conditions in the eye that involve neurogenic inflammation and the release of CGRP.",

The enhancement produced by 5-HTP, 5-MeODMT and PCA, was not antagonized by the prior administration of a dose of LSD or methysergide, although the enhancement produced by 5-MeODMT, LSD and methysergide, but not that produced by 5-HTP and PCA, was antagonized by cyproheptadine. In rats treated with 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine (intracisternal administration, 2 weeks previously) supersensitivity was observed to the effects of 5-HTP, a precursor of 5-HT, while subsensitivity was observed for the effects of PCA, a releaser of 5-HT. However, no supersensitivity was observed for the effects of 5-MeODMT, LSD and methysergide. These results suggest that methysergide may have an agonistic action on the 5-HT receptors in spinal cord and that supersensitivity to 5-HTP in rats treated with 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine was due to the lack of uptake of 5-HT into terminals of descending 5-HT fibres or to the change in 5-HT receptors which were not sensitive to 5-MeODMT, LSD, methysergide or cyproheptadine.",

Her hands were also cold but of normal colour. Her carotid, axillary, and femoral pulses were the only palpable peripheral pulses. She had suffered from migraine and duodenal ulceration for some years and had taken numerous drugs including propoxyphene, benzodiazepine derivatives, diclofenac, cimetidine, chlordiazepoxide, raubasine, sucralfate, ergotamine tartrate, and oxprenolol. The precise dosages and duration of these treatments could not be established, but we ascertained that she had been taking oxprenolol and ergotamine tartrate tablets for a considerable time before admission. Arteriography showed severe spasm of most parts of the femoral arteries, the distal parts of the brachial arteries, and the radial arteries. Intravenous infusion of heparin (500 units/hour) and dopamine (150-300 4g/min) resulted in moderate improvement in the circulation except in the left foot, which remained painful and developed a mottled appearance. A cannula was placed in the left femoral artery, and nitroglycerin (1 mg/hour) and heparin (500 units/hour) were infused. This caused a dramatic improvement. After 24 hours the peripheral pulses were palpable and the cannula was removed. Intravenous treatment was reduced over the next two days, and she made a satisfactory recovery.",

He had suffered from migraine for 10 years and had been taking methysergide (3 mg) and propranolol (120 mg) daily for two weeks. On examination his feet were pale, cold, and poorly perfused and only the femoral pulses were palpable in his legs. Aortography disclosed extreme bilateral narrowing of the superficial femoral arteries consistent with severe spasm. Intravenous infusions of 10% dextran 40 in saline (Rheomacrodex) and heparin (500 units/hour) and a lumbar epidural block with 1 % lignocaine failed to afford any improvement. Infusion of isoprenaline (1-2 ug/min) the next day resulted in mild improvement. Nevertheless, both feet gradually became gangrenous, and bilateral below knee amputations were performed six days after admission.",

The third case was treated at a late stage by continuous peridural anesthesia and various vasodilators without success and led to very severe mutilations in two young women. The third case was treated by continuous infusions of sodium nitropruside (SNP) under hemodynamic control, and recovery was rapid and complete. The value of SNP as an antidote for severe ergotism is discussed, together with its mode of administration, and precautions necessary when prescribing this extremely powerful vasodilator treatment for this indication.",

Methysergide significantly increased basal and submaximal pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion, and metergoline significantly inhibited gastric acidity in all experiments. Basal and stimulated serum gastrin concentrations were not modified by either drug. The effect of methysergide on gastric acid secretion was opposed to that of serotonin and was probably dependent on its antiserotoninergic action...",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

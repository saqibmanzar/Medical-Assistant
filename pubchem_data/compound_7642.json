PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.8X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates di-2-ethylhexyl azelate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase di-2-ethylhexyl azelate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 13 hours. Particulate-phase di-2-ethylhexyl azelate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Di-2-ethylhexyl azelate may undergo direct photolysis in the environment, since this compound contains a functional group that can absorb light >290 nm. If released to soil, di-2-ethylhexyl azelate is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 300,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole, however this process is expected to be attenuated by adsorption. If released into water, di-2-ethylhexyl azelate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 22 hours and 17 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 27 years, if adsorption is considered. Di-2-ethylhexyl azelate is expected to undergo hydrolysis producing 2-ethylhexanol and nonanedioic acid. An estimated hydrolysis rate constant of 0.07 L/mole-sec corresponds to half-lives of 3.2 years and 120 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to di-2-ethylhexyl azelate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where di-2-ethylhexyl azelate is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.2X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 22 hours and 17 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 27 years, if adsorption is considered(8). Di-2-ethylhexyl azelate is expected to undergo hydrolysis producing 2-ethylhexanol and nonanedioic acid(SRC). An estimated hydrolysis rate constant of 0.07 L/mole-sec corresponds to half-lives of 3.2 years and 120 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(9). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 9.6(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that di-2-ethylhexyl azelate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 22 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 17 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 27 years, if adsorption is considered(4). Di-2-ethylhexylazelate's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC), however this process is expected to be attenuated by adsorption. Di-2-ethylhexyl azelate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 3.8X10-6 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

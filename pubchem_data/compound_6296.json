PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

L-glutamic acid was either incorporated into the diet, from gestation day 2 to day 20, or suspended in sesame oil and administered by gavage, from gestation day 6 to day 10. A teratogenic dose of trypan blue was injected at day 8 of pregnancy, either intraperitoneally (14 mg/kg maternal body weight) or subcutaneously (160 mg/kg). The amount of glutamic acid consumed, after the injection of trypan blue, ranged from 600 to 1,500 mg/rat/day. At day 20, the fetuses were examined. Glutamic acid failed consistently to protect the rat embryo against the lethal and teratogenic action of trypan blue. These results are in contrast to those obtained in mice. The administration of sesame oil alone was found to cause embryonic death but not malformations.",

(1) cultured human corneal fibroblasts /were exposed/ to trypan blue (0.0001% to 0.1%) in Eagle modified minimum essential medium (EMEM) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes to 24 hours. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by Mosmann's colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MMT) assay. (2) human corneas /were exposed/ in EMEM for 24 hours to trypan blue (0.001% to 0.1%). Fellow donor corneas served as controls. Endothelial survival was evaluated morphologically and by cell density assessment. (3) the endothelial viability of human donor corneas /was morphologically compared/ after exposure to 0.1% trypan blue for 5 to 30 minutes with control corneas. RESULTS: In experiment 1, trypan blue in EMEM was not significantly toxic at concentrations of 0.005% or lower. Higher concentrations were toxic only after exposure to trypan blue for at least 6 hours. In PBS, significant toxicity was found after exposure to 0.1% trypan blue for 30 minutes or longer. Lower concentrations were toxic after longer exposures. In experiment 2, exposure to 0.01% and 0.1% trypan blue for 24 hours resulted in significant loss in cell density. At lower concentrations, the endothelium was affected only morphologically. In experiment 3, endothelial morphology changed in control corneas and after exposure to 0.1% trypan blue for as little as 5 minutes. After 30-minute exposure, morphologic deterioration was more pronounced. CONCLUSIONS: Trypan blue was toxic in vitro to corneal endothelium and corneal fibroblasts at higher concentrations and notably longer exposure times. Toxicity was less in EMEM than in PBS. Clinical Relevance: At commonly used concentrations, both during cataract surgery and in the cornea bank, trypan blue is safe for corneal cells. At higher concentrations or longer exposures, however, caution is warranted.",

Three concentrations (0.06 mg/mL, 0.6 mg/mL, and 4 mg/mL) of trypan blue were applied to human ARPE19 cells for 1 minute. Cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. RPE cells were sampled daily for 6 consecutive days to assess the effects of trypan blue on cell viability. The effects of trypan blue on the expression of apoptosis related and cell cycle arrest gene expressions including c-fos, c-jun, p53, and p21 were performed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining. RESULTS: The MTT assay showed a concentration dependent suppression effect of trypan blue on cell viability, with higher reduction in the 0.6 mg/ml and 4 mg/mL trypan blue treated groups. No significant change in the expression of c-fos and c-jun was found with all three concentrations of trypan blue. An increase in p53 expression was found in the 4 mg/mL trypan blue treated group at 10-30 minutes after trypan blue application. Immunostaining showed a mild, albeit insignificant, increase of p53 expression in the RPE cells. No significant increase in p21 expression was observed in the 0.06 mg/mL trypan blue treated group but there were significant increases in p21 expression in both the 0.6 mg/mL (p = 0.032) and the 4 mg/mL (p = 0.025) treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Trypan blue may lead to toxicity on cultured RPE cells as indicated by the reduction in cell viability and changes in the expression of apoptosis related and cell cycle arrest genes at higher concentrations. The application of 0.06 mg/mL trypan blue for 1 minute appeared to have no significant effect on cultured RPE.",

But they may have toxic effects on the retina. ... The acute and chronic toxicities of these stains on cultured human retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells /were compared/ using clinically relevant concentrations and an identical experimental setup for each agent. METHODS: Monolayers of RPE cells were incubated with various concentrations of indocyanine green, infracyanine green (each at 0.005%, 0.05%, and 0.5%) or trypan blue (0.05%, 0.06%, 0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.5%) for 5 min (acute exposure) or 6 days (chronic exposure). Using the propidium iodide assay, acute cytotoxicity was monitored at 15-min intervals for up to 3 hr. Chronic cytotoxicity was assessed by monitoring cell calcein esterase activity, cell proliferation, and cell morphology (viability) after 6 days of exposure. RESULTS: Indocyanine and infracyanine green induced acute and chronic toxicities at a concentration above 0.05%. Trypan blue evoked no acute toxicity, but it was chronically cytotoxic at all tested concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite thorough rinsing after application, significant amounts of the not sufficiently water soluble indocyanine and infracyanine green are retained after surgery by the eye. Trypan blue, being more water-soluble than ICG, is probably retained to the least degree. This circumstance is fortunate given that trypan blue exhibits a chronic cytotoxicity comparable to ICG at all clinically relevant concentrations. During vitrectomy, surgeons should aim to expose retinal tissue to only low concentrations of these stains and for as short a period as possible.",

Dutch belted rabbits (n=8) were vitrectomized followed by subretinal injection of 2.4 mg/mL PB (285 mOsm) and 1.5 mg/mL TB (312 mOsm); balanced salt solution (BSS) (300 mOsm) served as the control. Animals were examined 6, 12, and 24 hr and 14 days after the procedure by fluorescein angiography (FA) and indirect ophthalmoscopy; for retinal toxicity, histologic evaluation studies were performed by light and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: FA examination demonstrated window defects suggestive of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy in positions of subretinal TB injection, but this was not observed after subretinal injection of PB or BSS. Histologic evaluation disclosed only minimal abnormalities on the photoreceptor outer segment (POS) after subretinal injection of BSS during all follow-up. Subretinal injection of PB caused POS and photoreceptor inner segment (PIS) abnormalities 12 and 24 hr after surgery as well as outer nuclear layer (ONL) damage 14 days after surgery. Subretinal TB injection resulted in POS and PIS damage at 12 hr follow-up. The ONL damage was observed 24 hr after surgery; additionally, POS, PIS, ONL, and RPE abnormalities were observed 14 days after surgery after TB injection. CONCLUSIONS: Subretinal injection of TB induced more significant clinical and histologic damage of neurosensory retina/RPE than did PB or BSS.",

DESIGN: Experimental study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty Dutch-belted rabbits. METHODS: Ten animals underwent vitrectomy and subretinal injection of 0.02 mL of either 0.05% ICG (279 milliosmoles [mOsm]), 0.15% trypan blue (312 mOsm), 5% GL (280 mOsm), or BSS (300 mOsm), which was tested as a control. Ten additional animals underwent subretinal injection of 0.02 mL of 0.046% ICG (251 mOsm), 0.13% trypan blue (260 mOsm), 4.6% GL (253 mOsm), or BSS (300 mOsm). Animals were examined 6, 12, and 24 hours and 14 days after the procedure by fluorescein angiography and fundus evaluation; histologic studies were performed by light and transmission electron microscopy. ... RESULTS: All subretinal blebs were flat 24 hours after the procedure. Fluorescein angiography showed window defects where ICG and trypan blue had been injected. Subretinal BSS and GL resulted in minimal abnormalities of the photoreceptor outer segments (POS) during follow-up. Hypo-osmolar GL caused edema in all retinal layers; pyknosis of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) was observed 24 hours after injection. Subretinal injection of trypan blue resulted in histologic abnormalities 24 hours and 14 days after surgery. Hypo-osmolar trypan blue caused edema of the POS and the photoreceptor inner segments and pyknosis of the ONL 6 and 12 hours after surgery; the retinal pigment epithelium also was affected 24 hours and 14 days after surgery. Subretinal injection of iso-osmolar and hypo-osmolar ICG caused severe damage of all retinal layers during the entire follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Subretinal injection of 0.05% ICG results in more substantial retinal damage than that associated with the 0.15% trypan blue subretinal injection. The damage induced by hypo-osmolar solutions was more important than that caused by the iso-osmolar solutions.",

Trypan Blue's former use as a diagnostic agent for ocular diseases and in the treatment of sleeping sickness may have resulted in its release to the environment. Trypan Blue is an ionic compound that will be essentially non-volatile in the environment. Particulate-phase Trypan Blue will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Trypan Blue absorbs light at 607 nm and therefore will be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Trypan Blue may be mobile in soils and sediments based on its solubility in water; however, biodegradation studies have observed adsorption to activated sludge indicating that Trypan Blue may be immobile in certain environmental conditions. Volatilization from moist soil, dry soil, or water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since it is an ionic compound. Trypan Blue was 75% removed from the aerobic activated sludge inoculum based on DOC and 87% removed based on color removal after 48 days, although adsorption may have been the main process of removal. It degraded 90% after 7 days in anaerobic sludge, indicating Trypan Blue may biodegrade in anaerobic environments. Based on its solubility in water, Trypan Blue may have low potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to Trypan Blue may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where Trypan Blue is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to Trypan Blue via dermal contact with this compound or other consumer products containing Trypan Blue. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

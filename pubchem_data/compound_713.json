When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

                                "Description": "In general, the occupational exposure limit (OEL) indicates the level of admissible exposure, for a length of time (usually 8 hours), to a chemical or physical hazard that is not likely to affect the health of a worker. The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Male & female mice were exposed to FORM in drinking water at doses of 0, 100, 350, & 750 ppm (/about/ 20-200 mg/kg/day). A Max Tolerated Dose (MTD) of FORM, based on indices of generalized toxicity, was not reached for F0 animals. However, reproductive toxicity, including reduced fertility & litter size, was observed at 750 ppm FORM. F0 females at 750 ppm FORM exhibited an incr in the avg days to litter, & tended to spend more time in diestrus than in another stage of the cycle. FORM caused no detectable change in the histopathology of kidney, liver, or reproductive organs. Estimated exposure for the F0 generation was 24, 80, & 195 mg/kg/day for the 100, 350, & 750 ppm FORM groups, respectively. Females tended to have higher relative exposure (mg/kg/day) compared to males. F1 postnatal survival was unaffected by treatment. The MTD for the F1 generation was 750 ppm FORM, based on reduced body weight. Mild reproductive toxicity, observed as reduction in litter size & increased days to litter, occurred at 750 ppm. No significant histopathologic changes were observed in either males or females. Estimated exposure to FORM was 26, 87, & 190 mg/kg/day for F1 animals. In summary, the MTD for generalized toxicity was not reached for the F0 generation, but was established at 750 ppm for the F1 generation. The No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for generalized toxicity was 750 ppm for the F0 generation & 350 ppm for the generation. Reproductive toxicity was observed at 750 ppm in both generations.",

Dose selection was based on a screening study in which CD rats were treated by gavage with 0, 62, 125, 250, 500, or 1000 millgrams formamide per kilogram body weight per day on gestational days (gd) 6-19 ... . Maternal toxicity was noted at greater than or equal to 250 mg/kg/day, including morbidity, and reductions in water/food intake, body weight, and weight gain. Fetal body weight was reduced at greater than or equal to 125 mg/kg/day ... . In this study, female Sprague-Dawley-derived (CD\u00ae ) rats were dosed by gavage with formamide (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle (deionized/distilled water) on gestational days 6-19. The dose volume was 5 ml/kg. Twenty-five timed-mated rats were assigned to each group. Dams were monitored at regular intervals throughout gestation for clinical signs, food and water intake, and body weight. At necropsy on gestational days 20, the following were recorded: maternal clinical condition; body, liver, and gravid uterine weights; pregnancy status; and number of corpora lutea. In the gravid uterus, the numbers of resorbed, dead, or live fetuses were recorded. All live fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for external morphological anomalies. Approximately, one-half of the fetuses were examined for visceral anomalies, including internal head structures, and the remaining fetuses were examined for skeletal anomalies. Pregnancy was confirmed in 88-92% of females/group. No maternal deaths occurred, and there were no dose-related clinical signs. Maternal body weight exhibited significant decreasing trends (gestational days 15-20), with significant reductions at 200 mg/kg/day on gestational days 18, 19, and 20. Maternal body weight gain was also reduced at 200 mg/kg/day from gestational days 6 to 9, from gestational days 15 to 18, for the treatment period as a whole (gestational days 6 to 20), and for the gestational period as a whole (gestational days 0 to 20). However, maternal gestational weight gain, corrected for gravid uterine weight, was not affected. Maternal food and water intake were also unaffected Maternal liver weight (absolute or relative) was not affected by formamide exposure. Gravid uterine weight exhibited a significant decreasing trend (100, 94, and 87% of control weight), and the reduction was significant at 200 mg/kg/day. Prenatal mortality (resorptions and late fetal deaths), live litter size, and percent males/litter were not affected by formamide exposure. Average fetal body weight/litter exhibited a decreasing trend (98, 97, and 85% of average control weight), with significant reductions at greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day. No statistically significant differences were observed in the incidences of fetal morphological anomalies (malformations or variations). In summary, CD\u00ae rats were dosed by gavage with formamide (0, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) on gestational days 6-19. Minimal evidence of maternal toxicity was found at 200 mg/kg/day. Gravid uterine weight was reduced at 200 mg/kg/day, and fetal body weight was reduced at greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg/day. Thus, the maternal toxicity NOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day, and the LOAEL was 200 mg/kg/day. The developmental toxicity NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day, and the LOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day.",

Dose selection was based on a developmental toxicity screen in New Zealand White rabbits ... . Naturally-mated female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were dosed by gavage with formamide (10, 20, 40, 80 or 120 mg/kg body weight/day) or its vehicle (deionized/distilled water) on gestational days (gd) 6 through 29. Mild maternal toxicity and abortion or early delivery in 3 out of 7 pregnancies were found at 120 mg/kg/day. Although not statistically significant, the reduction in average fetal body weight at the high dose (83% of control weight) was considered to be a biologically relevant response to FORM exposure. In this study, female New Zealand White rabbits were dosed by gavage with formamide (35, 70, or 140 mg/kg/day) or its vehicle (deionized/distilled water) on gestational days 6 through 29. The dose volume was 1 ml/kg. The study was conducted in a two-replicate design. Twenty-four timed naturally-mated female rabbits (12 per replicate) were assigned to each group. Does were monitored at regular intervals throughout gestation for clinical signs, food intake, and body weight. At necropsy on gestational days 30, the following were recorded: maternal clinical condition; body, liver and gravid uterine weights; pregnancy status; and number of corpora lutea. In the gravid uterus, the numbers of resorbed, dead, or live fetuses were recorded. All live fetuses were weighed, sexed, and examined for morphological anomalies (external, visceral, and skeletal). Approximately one-half of the fetuses were examined for anomalies of the internal head structures. Abortions or early deliveries were noted in 0, 2, 2, and 8 females in the 0, 35, 70, and 140 mg/kg/day dose groups, respectively. At necropsy, confirmed pregnancy rates were 86-100% per group. One maternal death and four maternal deaths occurred in the low and high dose groups, respectively. Clinical signs associated with formamide exposure were minimal. Reduced or absent fecal output was more often recorded at the high dose (2-13 animals per day), presumably related to reduced feed consumption. A significant decreasing trend was noted for maternal body weight on gestational days 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 29, and 30, maternal body weight change for gestational days 12 to 15, 15 to 18, 18 to 21 and 21 to 24, but not for weight change during treatment (gestational days 6 to 29) or gestation (0 to 30). Maternal body weight was significantly depressed in the high dose group on gestational days 21, 24, and 27. Maternal body weight change was significantly depressed at the high dose for gestational days 12 to 15, 18 to 21, and 21 to 24. In addition, maternal body weight change was depressed at the mid dose for gestational days 18 to 21. No significant treatment-related effects were observed for corrected maternal weight gain. Relative maternal food intake (g/kg/day) exhibited a decreasing trend during most of the treatment period treatment (gestational days 9 to 24), and was 34-59% of control intake in the high dose group from gestational days 12 through gestational days 24. Thereafter, no significant differences were noted among treatment groups for maternal relative feed consumption. Maternal liver weight (absolute and relative to body weight) was equivalent among groups. Gravid uterine weight exhibited a dose-related decreasing trend and was 71% of the control value at the high dose (significant). Formamide exposure decreased average litter size at 140 mg/kg/day that was 66% of the control mean. Mean fetal body weight per litter (males, females, and sexes combined) exhibited a decreasing trend. Mean fetal body weight per litter for males and the sexes combined was significantly decreased at the high dose. There was no effect of treatment on the incidence of external, visceral, or skeletal malformations or variations. In summary, maternal mortality and other indices of maternal toxicity were noted in this study at the high dose, and the maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for formamide was 70 mg/kg/day. Formamide caused significant treatment-related developmental toxicity at 140 mg/kg/day, consisting of reduced mean live litter size and fetal body weight per litter. Thus, the developmental toxicity NOAEL was also 70 mg/kg/day.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 6.1X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates formamide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase formamide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.0 days. If released to soil, formamide is expected to have very high mobility based upon a Koc of 3.6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. If released into water, formamide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Several biodegradation screening studies have observed significant biodegradation of formamide which suggests that biodegradation may be important. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be slow. Occupational exposure to formamide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where formamide is produced or used. (SRC)",

According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from a log Kow of -1.51(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Formamide is hydrolyzed very slowly at room temperature; the rate of hydrolysis increases rapidly in the presence of acid or bases and is further accelerated at elevated temperature(9). Biodegradation is an important fate process in water based on its biodegradability in aqueous screening tests(10-13).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

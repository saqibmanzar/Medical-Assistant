PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Through alterations in intracellular thiol status, mercury can promote oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and changes in heme metabolism. Mercury is known to bind to microsomal and mitochondrial enzymes, resulting in cell injury and death. For example, mercury is known to inhibit aquaporins, halting water flow across the cell membrane. It also inhibits the protein LCK, which causes decreased T-cell signalling and immune system depression. Mercury is also believed to inhibit neuronal excitability by acting on the postsynaptic neuronal membrane. It also affects the nervous system by inhibiting protein kinase C and alkaline phosphatase, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Organic mercury exerts developmental effects by binding to tubulin, preventing microtubule assembly and causing mitotic inhibition. Mercury also produces an autoimmune response, likely by modification of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, self peptides, T-cell receptors, or cell-surface adhesion molecules.

Minimal single embryotoxic doses of Agronal Super were estimated in 24-day old chick embryos using the CHEST method and compared with the minimal embryotoxic doses of other 8 seed mordants without mercury. Minimal embryotoxic doses (the beginning of the embryotoxicity range) of Agronal Super were between 0.1-1.0 ug/embryo. The seed mordants without mercury appeared to be less toxic: The minimal embryotoxic doses of Baytan Combi, Baytan Universal, Fundasol, Quinolate and Wolfen Thiuram were between 1-10 ug/embryo. Novozir and Sibutol had minimal embryotoxic doses within the range 10-100 ug/embryo. The least dangerous appeared the seed mordant Vincit, which produced no embryotoxic effect, even after administration of the highest doses (100 ug/embryo). Our results demonstrated the difference of several orders of magnitude between embryotoxic doses of Agronal Super and other 8 seed mordants. Replacement of seed mordants containing organic mercury (e.g. Agronal Super) by new ones with minimal or no embryotoxic effect (e.g. Vincit) is advisable.",

Mercury was administered via the feed at dosages of 5 ppm, 30 ppm, and 30 ppm Hg + 4 ppm Se, for 56 days. After two months, egg production decreased by 8.18% and 7.74% in hens fed 30 ppm Hg, and 30 ppm Hg + 4 ppm Se, respectively. Egg weight decreased in all experimental groups. In comparison to the controls, these results were highly significant (P < 0.01) in hens fed 30 ppm Hg and 30 ppm Hg + 4 ppm Se and significant (P < 0.05) between hens fed 5 ppm Hg and 30 ppm Hg. Fertility rate and hatchability were not affected. Mercury exposure did not affect egg shape, egg-white height, egg-shell hardness or yolk colour. Both egg-shell thickness and weight decreased in all experimental groups. In the group supplemented with selenium there was a nonsignificant improvement in egg production, hatchability and all qualitative properties of eggs in comparison with the group without selenium supplementation. Residual mercury levels in egg yolk greatly surpassed the level found in the egg white: the highest values were measured in the group fed 30 ppm Hg. The addition of selenium had a protective effect upon residual Hg deposits in the yolk, but not in the egg-white.",

Two experimental gilts (P) were administered an experimental feed mixture containing phenylmercury chloride (40 mg/kg). Two control gilts (K) were fed the same mixture but without phenylmercury chloride. P gilts began to lag behind in their growth from day 60 of the experiment, they manifested nonphysiological postures (dog's sitting posture), paresis of hind limbs and uncoordinated movements. P gilts had cloudy, orange-brown urine from day 70 and from day 75 they began to suffer from diarrhoea. Mercury (Hg) contents in urine and blood serum of P gilts were irregularly variable: urine 0.58-2.15 mg/l, blood serum 0.02-0.37 mg/l. Hg content in excrements of P gilts fluctuated from 23 to 26 mg/kg. Vitamin A concentrations in blood serum and liver decreased in P gilts. Phenylmercury chloride feeding caused mutagenic changes in peripheral lymphocytes of P gilts (an increase in the number of aberrant cells from 2-3% to 8-9%) and reduced IgA, IgM and IgG immunoglobulin levels in blood serum. Pathological lesions were observed in the colon, kidneys and liver. None of the above-mentioned changes were observed in K gilts. Increased resistance to the negative effects of Hg was found in one experimental gilt. In comparison with K gilts, Hg concentrations in P gilts after 130 days of the experiment increased as follows: 427 times in kidneys, 333 times in liver, 106 times in guts, 71 times in pancreas, 53 times in ovaries, 50 times in muscles, 47 times in bristles and 16 times in the brain.",

The use of phenylmercury resulted in the exposure of house painters and residents to mercury vapors in the homes where interior and exterior latex paint was applied(1).

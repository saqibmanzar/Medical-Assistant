PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Salmeterol's benzene moiety resembles the structure of catecholamines, and occupies the active site of beta-2 adrenergic receptor, while the long, lipophilic side chain of salmeterol, binds to the so called 'exosite' near the beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The binding at the exosite allows the active portion of the molecule to remain at the receptor site and continually engage and disengage with the receptor, therefore providing a long duration of action. This agent stimulates intracellular adenyl cyclase to catalyze the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels result in relaxation of bronchiolar smooth muscle, bronchodilation and increased bronchial airflow.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Data from this study, called the Salmeterol Multi-center Asthma Research Trial (SMART), further suggest that the risk might be greater in African American patients. These results led to stopping the study prematurely. The data from the SMART study are not adequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids provides protection from this risk. Given the similar basic mechanisms of action of beta2-agonists, it is possible that the findings seen in the SMART study may be consistent with a class effect. Findings similar to the SMART study findings were reported in a prior 16-week clinical study performed in the United Kingdom, the Salmeterol Nationwide Surveillance (SNS) study. In the SNS study, the incidence of asthma-related death was numerically, though not statistically, greater in patients with asthma treated with salmeterol (42 ug twice daily) versus albuterol (180 ug 4 times daily) added to usual asthma therapy.",

Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, have been reported when salmeterol oral inhalation therapy has been initiated in such situations. In most cases, these adverse events have occurred in patients with severe asthma (e.g., those with a history of corticosteroid dependence, low pulmonary function, intubation, mechanical ventilation, frequent hospitalizations, or previous life-threatening acute asthma exacerbations) and/or in some patients in whom asthma has been acutely deteriorating (e.g., unresponsive to usual medications, increasing need for inhaled short-acting beta-agonists, marked increase in symptoms, recent emergency room visits, sudden or progressive deterioration in pulmonary function). However, such events also have occurred in patients with less severe asthma. Although it has not been determined whether salmeterol oral inhalation therapy contributed to these events or simply failed to relieve the deteriorating asthma, the manufacturer states that use of salmeterol oral inhalation in patients with substantially worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma is inappropriate.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

The hydrophilic tail of salmeterol binds to leucine residues in the exo-site of the beta-2 adrenoceptor almost irreversibly, allowing salmeterol to persist in the active site, which is responsible for it's long duration of action.

In vitro studies show salmeterol to be at least 50 times more selective for beta2-adrenoceptors than albuterol. Although beta2-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors in bronchial smooth muscle and beta1-adrenoceptors are the predominant receptors in the heart, there are also beta2-adrenoceptors in the human heart comprising 10% to 50% of the total beta-adrenoceptors. The precise function of these is not yet established, but they raise the possibility that even highly selective beta2-agonists may have cardiac effects.",

Despite this, salmeterol does not accumulate in tissues. Its mechanism of action can be explained by binding to a specific exo-site domain of the beta 2-receptor protein to produce continuous stimulation of the active site of the receptor, which gives salmeterol a profile of pharmacological activity unlike that of other beta 2-agonists. Due to its potent and prolonged activation of beta 2-adrenoceptors in airway smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, mast cells and epithelial cells, salmeterol induces prolonged bronchodilatation, reduced vascular permeability, inhibition of inflammatory mediators, stimulation of ciliary function and modulation of ion and water transport across the bronchial mucosa.",

It is in a class of medications called beta2-agonists. Beta2-agonists help to open the airways in the lungs (bronchodilators). Salmeterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist taken by breathing it into the lungs (inhalation). It is used together with an inhaled corticosteroid to treat asthma. For information on inhaled corticosteroids, see the MotherToBaby fact sheet at https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/inhaled-corticosteroids-icss-pregnancy/.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

These results led to stopping the study prematurely. The data from the SMART study are not adequate to determine whether concurrent use of inhaled corticosteroids provides protection from this risk. Given the similar basic mechanisms of action of beta2-agonists, it is possible that the findings seen in the SMART study may be consistent with a class effect. Findings similar to the SMART study findings were reported in a prior 16-week clinical study performed in the United Kingdom, the Salmeterol Nationwide Surveillance (SNS) study. In the SNS study, the incidence of asthma-related death was numerically, though not statistically, greater in patients with asthma treated with salmeterol (42 ug twice daily) versus albuterol (180 ug 4 times daily) added to usual asthma therapy.",

The information may include data from toxicity tests performed on aquatic and/or terrestrial organisms, where available (e.g., acute or chronic aquatic toxicity data for fish, algae, and crustaceans; toxicity data on birds, bees, and plants).  This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.9X10-15 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates salmeterol will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere. Particulate-phase salmeterol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Salmeterol does not contain chromophores that absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, salmeterol is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 7,800. The estimated pKa of salmeterol is 11.2, indicating that this compound will primarily exist as a cation in the environment. Cations adsorb strongly to organic carbon and clay and do not volatilize from water or moist soil surfaces. Salmeterol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, salmeterol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 7.0 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to salmeterol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where salmeterol is produced or used. Exposure to the drug among the general population may be limited to those being administered the drug salmeterol (a bronchodilator). (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

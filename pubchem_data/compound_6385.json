If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 372 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tert-butylamine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tert-butylamine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 33 hours. tert-Butylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tert-butylamine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 40. The pKa of tert-butylamine is 10.68 indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon its cation state. tert-Butylamine may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. tert-Butylamine was biodegraded by aniline-acclimated activated sludge, suggesting that biodegradation may be rapid in the environment. If released into water, tert-butylamine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 10.68 indicates tert-butylamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to tert-butylamine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tert-butylamine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tert-butylamine via the use of tobacco products, and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing tert-butylamine.

A pKa of 10.68(4) indicates tert-butylamine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). tert-Butylamine was biodegraded by aniline-acclimated activated sludge(8).",

Vapor-phase tert-butylamine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 33 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.18X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). tert-Butylamine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

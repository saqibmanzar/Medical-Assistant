When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Seven /UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)/ isoforms (UGT1A3, UGT1A4, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT2B13, UGT2B14, and UGT2B16) have been identified from rabbit liver, but these UGTs have not been investigated using DL as a substrate. In this work, the identities of UGT isoforms catalyzing the formation of DL glucuronide were investigated using rabbit liver microsomes (RabLM) and cloned/expressed as rabbit UGT isoforms. DL-N-glucuronide (DNG) production was determined quantitatively in RabLM and homogenates of COS-7 cells expressing each UGT isoform by using electrospray liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Analysis of DNG formation using RabLM, by Eadie-Hofstee plot, gave a Vmax of 0.911 nM/min/mg protein and the Km of 1.66 mM. DNG formation was catalyzed only by cloned expressed rabbit UGT1A7 and UGT2B16 (Vmax of 3.98 and 1.16 pmol/min/mg protein and a Km of 1.23 and 1.69 mM, respectively). Substrate inhibition of UGT1A7 by octylgallate confirmed the significant contribution of UGT1A7 to the formation of DNG. Octylgallate was further shown to competitively inhibit DNG production by RabLM (Ki = 0.149 mM). These results demonstrate that UGT1A7 is the major isoform catalyzing the N-glucuronidation of DL in RabLM.",

Dulcin (DL) possesses an ureido group that is metabolized by direct glucuronidation in rabbit liver microsomes. ...The glucuronidation of DL was studied using human liver microsomes (HLM) and expressed human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes. The average K (m) and V (max) values from nine HLM samples were 2.10 mM and 0.156 nmol/mg/min, respectively. Of the six human UGT isoforms screened for their ability to glucuronidate DL, only UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 showed activity. The apparent K (m) values using UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 were 5.06 and 6.99 mM, and the apparent V (max) values were 0.0461 and 0.106 nmol/min/mg, respectively. Phenolphthalein, a substrate for UGT1A9, inhibited DL glucuronidation in HLM competitively (K (i) = 0.356 mM), but bilirubin, a substrate for UGT1A1, did not.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Neural and behavioral responses to bitter-sweet mixtures, however, complicate the ostensible bitter and sweet labeled lines. In the golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, quinine hydrochloride, the bitter prototype, suppresses chorda tympani (CT) nerve responses to the sweet prototype: sucrose. This bitter-sweet inhibition was tested with concentration series of sucrose and dulcin, a hydrophobic synthetic sweetener that hamsters behaviorally cross-generalize with sucrose. Dulcin, sucrose and other sweeteners activate one subset of CT fibers: S neurons; whereas, quinine activates a separate subset of CT fibers: E neurons. Whole-nerve and S-neuron CT responses to a sweetener concentration series, mixed with 0, 1, 3 and 10 mM quinine, were measured for 0-2.5 s transient and/or 2.6-10 s steady-state response periods. Ten-sec total single-fiber records, aligned at response onset, were averaged for 100 ms bins to identify response oscillations. Quinine inhibition of dulcin and sucrose responses was identical. Each log molar increment in quinine resulted in equivalent declines in response to either sweetener. Furthermore, sucrose response decrements paralleled response increments in quinine-sensitive CT neurons to the same quinine increases. A 1.43 Hz bursting rhythm to the sweeteners was unchanged by quinine inhibition or decreases in sweetener concentration. Taste-bud processing, possibly between-cell inhibition and within-cell negative feedback, must modify signals initiated by T1 receptors before they are transmitted to the brain.",

Three groups of 10 hamsters were pre-exposed to 5 mM dulcin, 50 mM potassium L-glutamate (KGlu) or 1 mM 5'guanosine monophosphate (5'GMP). In the fourth group, the tongue was rinsed with 5'GMP for 20 min just prior to recording from the chorda tympani. The tastants were novel to the fifth group (naive control). A series of 17 stimuli was repeated six times and responses were quantified relative to the initial response of each of the 50 hamsters. The responses of the chorda tympani increased with repetition in the control group. In contrast, no increase in amplitude of response to the pre-exposed tastants or to stimuli with qualitatively related tastes was observed in the group familiarized with either KGlu or 5'GMP. These results indicate that the response of the chorda tympani depends on previous exposure to a tastant. The sensitivity of taste cells appears to be modulated, possibly by stimulus-induced supplementary receptors.",

The behavioral and electrophysiological responses of alpha-gustducin knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice to 11 different sweeteners, representing carbohydrates, artificial sweeteners, and sweet amino acids /was compared/. In behavioral experiments, over 48-h preference ratios were measured in two-bottle preference tests. In electrophysiological experiments, integrated responses of chorda tympani (CT) and glossopharyngeal (NG) nerves were recorded. /It was/ found that preference ratios of the KO mice were significantly lower than those of WT for acesulfame-K, dulcin, fructose, NC00174, D-phenylalanine, L-proline, D-tryptophan, saccharin, SC45647, sucrose, but not neotame. The nerve responses to all sweeteners, except neotame, were smaller in the KO mice than in the WT mice. The differences between the responses in WT and KO mice were more pronounced in the CT than in the NG. These data indicate that alpha-gustducin participates in the transduction of the sweet taste in general.",

Cross-adaptation levels were calculated as the ratio of isointense concentrations measured for a given stimulus before and under adaptation. ... Significant and reciprocal cross-enhancement is observed between DUL and MOD (approximately -20%, P < 0.03), and also between SUC and DUL (approximately -15%, P < 0.08). In parallel, molecular modeling of the four tastants was performed in order to look for the 12 common binding motifs that were isolated on 14 other tastants in a previous study. ...DUL and MOD only display four and five distinct motifs respectively and do not have any motif in common.

Dulcin's production and former use as a sweetener may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 9.8X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dulcin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dulcin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 hours. Particulate-phase dulcin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Dulcin absorbs light in the environmental UV spectrum and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dulcin is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc value of 43. The estimated Koc value for dulcin, which is a phenylurea compound, are consistent with observed Koc values for similar phenylurea compounds and herbicides which have Koc values in the in range of 20 to 75. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.58X10-11 atm-cu m/mole. Dulcin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its estimated vapor pressure. Phenylurea herbicides (similar in structure to dulcin) have reported soil dissipation half-lives on the order of 10 to 100 days with an approximate median soil dissipation half-life of 30 to 60 days; the soil dissipation rate of dulcin may be similar. If released into water, dulcin is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc value. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis half-lives at environmental pHs are expected to be on the order of 1 year or more. Occupational exposure to dulcin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dulcin is produced or used. Monitoring data were not available to indicate how the general population might be exposed to dulcin; however, dulcin's former use as sweetener (used in combination with saccharin) would have exposed the general population through ingestion of food and beverages containing the compound.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.58X10-11 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its estimated log Kow and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Ureas with chemical structures similar to dulcin have observed aqueous hydrolysis half-lives on the order of one year or more at environmental pHs(2). Dulcin has a UV absorption max at 290 nm(5) which indicates it may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

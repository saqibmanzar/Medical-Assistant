Animal studies have reported effects on the liver and central nervous system from oral exposure. Chronic (long-term) inhalation and oral exposure by humans may be associated with neurological effects including irritability, salivation, and dizziness, while oral exposure may result in effects on the blood.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Electrophysiological experiments on the cell body of the cockroach (Periplaneta americana) fast coxal depressor motor neuron (Df), and GABA-activated (36) Cl- uptake experiments on microsacs perpared from cockroach ventral nerve cords showed that both heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide blocked functional GABA receptors. The block appeared to be non-competitive and was voltage-independent over the membrane potential range -75 mV to -110 mV. There was no significant difference between the potencies of heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide in the functional assays for insect GABA receptors. Both compounds inhibited (35)S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in insects and vertebrates. The findings provide further evidence for block of an insect GABA receptor/Cl- channel by the cyclodiene class of polychlorocycloalkanes, and reveal differences in the insecticide (35)S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding site interactions of insects and vertebrates.",

The effects of 50 uM heptachlor on the respiratory activity of isolated liver mitochondria was tested in the presence of added succinate as a substrate. The effects of 100 uM heptachlor was tested in the presence of three kinds of substrates: succinate, beta-hydroxybutylate, and ascorbate plus N,N,N'N'-tetramethylphenylene-diamine. Heptachlor at 50 uM greatly inhibited the state 3 respiration, but inhibited the state 4 respiration hardly at all. The inhibition was released by 2,4-dinitrophenol. The higher dose suppressed state 3 and state 4 respiration almost completely with succinate as substrate. The findings suggest that the function of the electron transport system was also suppressed by the higher heptachlor dose even without oxidative phosphorylation.",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Although its use has been banned or severely restricted in many countries since the 1980's, it is still detected as a contaminant in some food commodities. Heptachlor in its pure form at room temperature appears as a white or light tan crystalline solid with a mild camphor or cedar like odor. The technical product is a soft wax. The technical product usually contains about 72% heptachlor and about 28% related compounds such as trans-chlordane (20-22%) and trans-nonachlor (4-8%). HUMAN EXPOSURE: In humans  placental transfer of heptachlor has been noted. Available epidemiological data do not show a clear relationship between adverse health effects and exposure to heptachlor. Consumption of foods containing pesticides such as heptachlor leads to an accumulation of these compounds in human tissues. Heptachlor has been detected in blood and serum samples, adipose tissue and breast milk. The most significant source of exposure of infants to heptachlor and its metabolites appears to be breast milk, in which concentrations can be much higher than those found in dairy milk. Heptachlor induced statistically significant increase in unscheduled DNA synthesis in human fibroblasts in the presence of metabolic activation and heptachlor inhibited junctional intracellular communication in cultured human cells. ANIMAL/PLANT/AVIAN/CRUSTACEAN/FISH/INVERTEBRATES STUDIES: In animals fed heptachlor by diet, gavage or sc injection, there is a sharp dose response curve for mortality. No marked differences were seen between treated animals and controls with respect to body weight and food consumption. Liver enlargement has been noted with accentuated lobulation; histopathological findings showed enlargement of centrilobular and midzonal hepatocytes. Fertility studies in rats injected with heptachlor sc resulted in suppression of reproductive hormone levels, disruptions in female cyclicity and delays in mating behavior. In developmental toxicity studies, there were usually no clinical signs of maternal toxicity (dose related alterations in weight gain) until mortality occurred. In one study reduced litter sizes  was noted, postnatal mortality of the pups was the most obvious finding. No teratological effects was noted. The profile of effects produced by repeated heptachlor to female rats consisted of altered activity, hyperexcitability and autonomic effects. Neurotoxicological studies on perinatal heptachlor exposure in the rat suggested developmental delays, alterations in GABAergic neurotransmission and neurobehavioral changes which included cognitive deficits at all doses. Heptachlor and technical grade heptachlor have been tested for carcinogenicity by oral administration in several strains of rats and mice. Technical grade heptachlor was shown to be carcinogenic in male and female mice but not in rats.  Heptachlor has been shown to be neurotoxic and immunotoxic in rats. Heptachlor shows mostly negative responses in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity testing. The acute toxicity of heptachlor was tested using a variety of aquatic species from different trophic levels. Heptachlor was shown to be toxic to fish and other species. Heptachlor appears to exhibit moderate toxic effects upon terrestrial vertebrates. Heptachlor has been found in tissues of water birds, amphibians, reptiles, seals and whales.  Heptachlor is clearly toxic to a range of both freshwater and marine species, including algae. Growth of both freshwater  marine species including algae and shrimp was effected by heptachlor exposure. Heptachlor is moderately toxic to birds.",

F-344 rats were gavaged on gestation days 6-15 with solutions of trichloroethylene (32 or 320 mg/kg/day), di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (78 or 780 mg/kg/day), and heptachlor (0.8 or 8 mg/kg/day) in corn oil. Each high dose was selected to produce minimal maternal toxicity when administered alone. The dams were allowed to deliver and their litters were examined on days 1 and 6. Implants were counted to determine prenatal loss. Maternal weight gain on gestation days 6-8 showed main effects of all three chemicals, but no significant interactions. Gestational weight gains exclusive of live litter weights revealed trichloroethylene and heptachlor main effects as well as a trichloroethylene-heptachlor interaction. Developmentally, full litter resorptions occurred in 20-75% of the dams in groups receiving a high dose of at least two of the compounds. Prenatal losses indicated a marginal trichloroethylene-heptachlor interaction. On day 1, main effects of trichloroethylene and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate were present for pup weight, while by day 6, only trichloroethylene exerted a main effect. Dose responses and synergistic effects of these toxicants are currently being pursued using additional doses in a 5x5x5 design.",

Oil-based cathartics such as castor oil or other substances including fats or oils should be avoided since these compounds may tend to enhance the absorption of the chlorinated hydrocarbon from the gastrointestinal tract. Epinephrine is contraindicated since it mayinduce ventricular fibrillation due to the sensition of the myocardium by the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Convulsions may be treated with diazepam in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, administered intravenously, to a maximum of 10 mg.

Moderately to severely poisoned patients should have intravenous lines and a cardiac monitor. The usual measures of gut decontamination (ipecac/lavage, charcoal, cathartics) are recommended within the first several hours after exposure. Experimental animal studies suggest that chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticide absorption by charcoal is highly variable. Most organochlorine insectides contain organic solvents, which are severe aspiration hazards. Skin decontamination (removal of contaminated clothes, washing of area with water and green or mild soap) is necessary to prevent continued dermal absorption. Be careful not to cross-contaminate health personnel. The use of cholestyramine (3-8 g four times a day) increased fecal excretion of chlordecone by seven times and reduced the mean blood half-life from 165 to 80 days. In organochlorine exposures to compounds that have substantial enterohepatic recirculation, activated charcoal also may reduce the half-life and should be considered in serial doses for moderate to severe acute poisonings. Dialysis, diuresis, and hemoperfusion are ineffective because of extensive tissue binding and large volumes of distribution. /Organochlorines/",

Groups of 50 rats of each sex were administered low or high concentrations of heptachlor for 80 wk then observed for 30 wk. Doses for the females were first increased, but because of toxic effects the doses were then reduced twice for both male and female rats during the remaining course of tests. Time weighted avg doses used for male rats were 38.9 and 77.9 ppm; for the females, 25.7 and 51.3 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated rats of each sex; pooled controls consisted of the matched control groups combined with 50 untreated male and 50 untreated female rats from similar bioassays of five other compounds. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at 110-111 wk. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were administered the test material at low or high concentrations for 80 wk, then observed for 10 wk. ... Because of toxic effects, doses were reduced once for the males at 17-18 wk after the initiation of the tests; twice for the females, at 17 and 30 wk, after the initiation of the tests. The time weighted avg doses used for the male mice were 6.1 and 13.8 ppm; for the females, 9 and 18 ppm. Matched controls consisted of groups of 10 untreated mice of each sex; pooled controls consisted of the matched control groups combined with 90 untreated male and 70 untreated female mice from similar bioassays of five other compounds. All surviving mice were /sacrificed/ at 90-91 wk. ... In mice, hepatocellular carcinoma showed a highly significant dose-related trend in both males and females. ... No other tumors were found in mice in sufficient numbers to justify analysis. In contrast to findings with mice, no hepatic tumors were observed in rats administered heptachlor. ... It was concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, heptachlor is carcinogenic for the liver in mice.",

Its production and former use in termite control, seed/seed furrow treatment, and wood treatment did result in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.00X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates heptachlor will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase heptachlor will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-life for these reactions in air are estimated to be 6.3 and 1.4 hours, respectively. Particulate-phase heptachlor will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Direct and photosensitized photolysis of unabsorbed heptachlor may occur in the environment. Heptachlor at 1.35X10-7 to 1.0X10-5 mole/l in acetone irradiated with light for >180 min at >290 nm degraded by about 5 to 10%. If released to soil, heptachlor is expected to have no mobility based upon a range of Kocs of 13,330 to 661,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.94X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Complete degradation of heptachlor in flooded Casiguran sandy loam and Louisiana clay occurred after 1 and 2 months, respectively, and was nearly complete in Maahas clay after 3 months. However, field dissipation half-lives for heptachlor can range from 40 days to 5.5 yrs. If released into water, heptachlor is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the range of Koc's. In water, 95.3% of heptachlor was removed by an acclimated aerobic mixed microbial culture in 4 weeks. Anaerobic incubation of heptachlor with thick sewage sludge inoculum at 53 \u00b0C resulted in complete degradation in about 1 day. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 9 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.5 years if adsorption is considered. A range of BCF values of 200 to 37,000 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. In water and moist soil, heptachlor readily undergoes hydrolysis to 1-hydrochlorodene which is then readily converted by microorganisms into heptachlor epoxide. The chemical hydrolysis half-life for heptachlor is 4.5 days at pH 7. Occupational exposure to heptachlor may occur through inhalation of dust particles and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where heptachlor was produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to heptachlor via inhalation of ambient air (especially indoor air of homes treated with heptachlor), ingestion of food (e.g., fish) and drinking water.

Volatilization of heptachlor from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 2.94X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(3). However, volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC). When heptachlor was applied to orchard grass, approximately 90% was lost in 7 days(4). Six hours and 6 days after application of heptachlor to a moist soil surface, 50% and 90% of the heptachlor had volatilized, respectively(5). However, only 7% of heptachlor incorporated 7.5 cm into soil had volatilized after 167 days(5). Fifty hours following the application of heptachlor to a dry soil surface, 14 to 40% of the heptachlor had volatilized(5). In moist soil, heptachlor readily undergoes hydrolysis to 1-hydrochlorodene which is then readily converted by microorganisms into heptachlor epoxide(6). Chemical hydrolysis half-lives for heptachlor are 5.4, 4.3, 4.5, 4.5, and 3.0 days for pH 4.5,5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively(7). Heptachlor absorbs light weakly above 290 nm(8) and thin films of heptachlor have been shown to undergo direct photolysis when exposed to sunlight and artificial light sources >290 nm(9). Degradation of heptachlor in flooded Casiguran sandy loam after 1 month and Louisiana clay after 2 months was complete (initial concn about 13 ppm) and nearly complete in Maahas clay after 3 months(10). In Pila clay loam, degradation proceeded to only about 5 ppm from the initial level of about 13 ppm after 3 months(10). Biodegradation of heptachlor by soil microorganisms produced heptachlor epoxide and chlordene(11). Field dissipation half-lives for heptachlor can range from 40 days to 5.5 yrs(2).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.94X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 9 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.5 years hours if adsorption is considered(5). The volatilization half-life of heptachlor was determined to be 0.73 days from static distilled water and 0.29 days from stirred river water(depth not specified)(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values ranging from 200 to 37,000(8-13), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Heptachlor readily undergoes chemical hydrolysis to 1-hydrochlorodene which is then readily processed by microorganisms into heptachlor epoxide(14). Chemical hydrolysis half-lives for heptachlor are 5.4, 4.3, 4.5, 4.5, and 3.0 days for pH 4.5, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively(15). When heptachlor was aerobically incubated with acclimated, mixed microbial cultures, an average of 95.3% of the initial heptachlor was removed in 4 weeks(16). The products were chlordene, 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene and heptachlor epoxide(17). Anaerobic incubation with thick sewage sludge inoculum at 53 \u00b0C resulted in complete degradation of 10 ppm heptachlor in about 1 day(18).",

Vapor-phase heptachlor is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone(SRC). The half-life for reaction with hydroxyl radicals in air is estimated to be 6.3 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.11X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). The half-life for reaction with ozone in air is estimated to be 1.4 hour(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.0X10-16 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) determined using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase heptachlor may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Heptachlor absorbs weakly above 290 nm(4) and thin films of heptachlor have been shown to undergo direct photolysis when exposed to sunlight and artificial light sources >290 nm(4).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The products were chlordene, 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene and heptachlor epoxide(1). When heptachlor was aerobically incubated with acclimated, mixed microbial cultures, 95.3% of the initial heptachlor was removed in 4 weeks(2); biodegradation of 1 mg/l heptachlor occurred immediately(2). The products resulting from the incubation of heptachlor with a mixed culture of soil microorganisms were chlordene(7%), 1-exohydroxychlordene, heptachlor epoxide (<0.04%) and chlordene epoxide (<0.02%) which were formed after 2 weeks(3). Biodegradation of heptachlor by soil microorganisms produced heptachlor epoxide and chlordene(4). Degradation of heptachlor in flooded Casiguran sandy loam after 1 month and Louisiana clay after 2 months was complete (initial level about 13 ppm) and nearly complete in Maahas clay after 3 months(5). In Pila clay loam, degradation proceeded to only about 5 ppm from the initial level of about 13 ppm (approx 38%) after 3 months(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.3 hrs and 1.4 hrs at an atmospheric concn of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm and 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm, respectively(1). In water, heptachlor readily undergoes chemical hydrolysis to 1-hydrochlorodene which is then readily converted by microorganisms into heptachlor epoxide(2). Chemical hydrolysis half-lives for heptachlor are 5.4, 4.3, 4.5, 4.5, and 3.0 days for pH 4.5,5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0, respectively(3). Heptachlor absorbs weakly above 290 nm(4) and thin films of heptachlor have been shown to undergo direct photolysis when exposed to sunlight and artificial light sources >290 nm(5). The products were two dechlorinated photoproducts and heptachlor epoxide(5). Heptachlor at 1.35X10-7 mol/l to 1.0X10-5 mol/l in acetone irradiated for >180 min at >290 nm degraded by about 5 to 10%(6). Photoheptachlor was the photoproduct(6). Heptachlor also undergoes photosensitized photolysis in the presence of benzophenone(5). Photolysis of heptachlor can take place on plant leaves in the presence of sunlight or UV light(7). Thus, direct and photosensitized photolysis of unabsorbed heptachlor may occur in the environment(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

According to a classification scheme(7), these BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms ranges from high to very high(SRC). Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for heptachlor have been measured for aquatic molluscs (250 to 2,500), oysters (17,600), pelecypod (3,900 to 8,500), decapod (200 to 700), Cyprinodon variegatus (7,400 to 21,300), Lagodon rhomboides (2,800 to 7,700), Leiostomus xanthurus (3,000 to 13,800), Cyprinodon variegatus (3,700 to 4,600), trout(300), and fathead minnow(6,310 to 20,000)(2). BCFs of heptachlor are 3,800 in mosquito fish(3); 3,600 to 7,400 in spot(3); 21,379 in sheepshead minnows(4); 37,000 in snails(3); 21,000 in alga(3); 18,000 in oysters(6); and 17,400 in unidentified fish species(5). At Mar Meno Lagoon (SE Spain), the BCF of heptachlor was measured in plant and aquatic organisms(8): algae (470), red algae (3,220), bivalve mollusc (1,770), and isopods (56,030). The bioaccumulation (ie, concn in biota/concn in soil) of heptachlor by earthworms ranges from 0.92 to 2.7(9). The BCF of heptachlor in vegetation is 0.033(2). Biomagnification of heptachlor in the aquatic food chain is significant, however because it is readily metabolized to heptachlor epoxide by higher tropic level organisms, biomagnification of heptachlor itself is not significant(10).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 1.5 years if adsorption is considered(3). The volatilization half-life of heptachlor from glass surfaces was determined to be 0.73 days from static distilled water and 0.29 days from stirred river water(4). Heptachlor's Henry's Law constant(1) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). When heptachlor was applied to orchard grass, approximately 90% was lost in 7 days(5). Six hours and 6 days after application of heptachlor to a moist soil surface, 50% and 90% of the heptachlor had volatilized, respectively(6). However, only 7% of heptachlor incorporated 7.5 cm into soil had volatilized after 167 days(6). Fifty hours following the application of heptachlor to a dry soil surface, 14 to 40% of the heptachlor had volatilized(6).",

Heptachlor was listed as a contaminant of the Great Lakes including Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior(3). In 1980, heptachlor was detected in the waters of Lake Pontchartrain Inner Harbor Navigation Canal at a concn of 0.6 ng/l at an ebb tide of 1.5 m and at concns ranging from 9.1 to 9.3 ng/l at flood tides of 1.5 to 10 m(4). Heptachlor was detected with a 21.4% frequency of occurrence for 604 samples of surface waters from New Jersey collected from 1977 to 1979(5). Heptachlor was detected in Mississippi River water at Louisiana at concns ranging from undetected levels to 2.4 ng/l for the summer to winter of 1974(6). Mediterranean waters off the coast of Morocco contained heptachlor at concns ranging from trace quantities to 11 ppb, trace quantities to 100 ppb and trace quantities to 3 ppb with mean concns of 5, 20 and 2 ppb for 8 samples each collected during the autumn, winter and spring, respectively(7). Throughout 1982, surface waters of the Donana National Park, Spain contained Heptachlor at concn ranging from 0.002 to 0.006 ppb(8). Heptachlor was detected at two locations in the Shatt al-Arab river (Iraq) at mean concns of 10 ng/l (range, 2 to 19 ng/l) and 79 ng/l (range, 50 to 91 ng/l), respectively(9).

Absorption of residues in potatoes were 9 to 11% of initial deposits of 3.72 to 3.85 ppm heptachlor; absorption of residues in sweet potatoes were 13 to 15% of initial deposits of 5.46 to 5.84 ppm heptachlor; absorption of residues in onions were 13 to 16% of initial deposits of 11.20 to 11.69 ppm heptachlor. The absorption was highest in potato followed by sweet potato and onion. The harvest time residues were considerably influenced by the post-harvest processings. Washing alone removed 22-29% residues from all the crops; washing followed by peeling and cooking reduced 85-93% residues from sweet potato, and 94-100% residues from potato. Dehydration reduced 74-100, 80-100 and 84-100% residues from sweet potato, potato and onion, respectively. Cooking was most effective, and left 0.03 ppm of heptachlor in sweet potato and potato, and no residues in onion at 10.0 kg active ingredient/hectacre.",

Heptachlor was detected in 16 of 105 chicken fat samples collected between Apr 1980 and Feb 1982 in Kenya; the mean concn was <0.01 mg/kg (range, 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg)(3). Heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide combined were detected at avg concns of 5.3 ppb in 1974 and 6.6 ppb in 1980 upon soybeans grown in Illinois(4). For vegetables surveyed in the markets of Delhi, India from Aug 1984 to Jan 1986, the avg heptachlor concns were 12 ug/kg for potato; 4 ug/kg for colocasia; 20 ug/kg for radish; 15 ug/kg for onion; 4 ug/kg for cabbage; 2 ug/kg for cauliflower; 1 ug/kg for coriander; 21 ug/kg for spinach; 23 ug/kg for brinjal; 1 ug/kg for ladyfinger; 1 ug/kg for french beans; 4 ug/kg for tomato; 389 ug/kg for green peas; 23 ug/kg for bottle gourd; 2 ug/kg for smooth gourd; 2 ug/kg for bitter gourd; 10 ug/kg for cucumber; and 42 ug/kg for chilies(5).

Human milk samples obtained from 1,436 women residing in the United States were analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. While heptachlor was recovered in less than 2% of the samples, heptachlor epoxide was found in 63% of the samples(2). The proportion of breast milk samples containing heptachlor epoxide varied significantly among the five geographic regions (66.1 to 128 ppb) with the southeastern states having the highest mean residual level(2). One possible explanation for the higher level in the southeastern states is that more homes were treated with heptachlor for termite control(2). The mean residual level of heptachlor epoxide for the whole United States was 91.4 ppb(2). A 5-month follow-up study of four pregnant Iraqi women without occupational exposure to organochlorine pesticides found an avg total heptachlor level in mother's whole milk of 0.051 mg/kg (range, 15 to 68 mg/kg)(3). Heptachlor was found at concns <1 to 2 ng/g in the milk of Australian women exposed to heptachlor from its use as an insecticide(4). The mean concn of heptachlor in human milk samples collected in Cairo (Egypt) in May 1987 was 1 ppb (1 of 31 samples)(5).",

The NOES Survey does not include farm workers(SRC). Occupational exposure to heptachlor may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where heptachlor is produced or used(SRC). In 1977, heptachlor was detected at levels ranging from 1.64 to 13.2 ppb in workplace air at a plant in TN that manufactured heptachlor(2). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to heptachlor via inhalation of ambient air (especially indoor air of homes treated with heptachlor), ingestion of food (eg, fish) and drinking water, and products containing heptachlor(SRC). In a study of the exposure of applicators and residents to heptachlor when used for subterranean termite control in homes, results indicated that applicator exposure to heptachlor was 1.8 ug/kg per hr for dermal and 0.08 ug/kg per hr for respiratory exposure (total = 1.88 ug/kg per hr)(3); respiratory exposure of residents to heptachlor was 2.86 ug/cu m(3).",

Human milk samples obtained from 1,436 women residing in the United States were analyzed for chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. While heptachlor was recovered in less than 2% of the samples, heptachlor epoxide was found in 63% of the samples(2). The proportion of breast milk samples containing heptachlor epoxide varied significantly among the five geographic regions (66.1 to 128 ppb) with the southeastern states having the highest mean residual level(2). One possible explanation for the higher level in the southeastern states is that more homes were treated with heptachlor for termite control(2). The mean residual level of heptachlor epoxide for the whole United States was 91.4 ppb(2). A 5-month follow-up study of four pregnant Iraqi women without occupational exposure to organochlorine pesticides found an avg total heptachlor level in mother's whole milk of 0.051 mg/kg (range, 15 to 68 mg/kg)(3). Heptachlor was found at concns <1 to 2 ng/g in the milk of Australian women exposed to heptachlor from its use as an insecticide(4).",

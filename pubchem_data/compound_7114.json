When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

No data are available to suggest that it is inadvertently formed during any commercial process or in the environment. p-Nitrobiphenyl was formerly used in the manufacture of 4-diphenylamine. Release to the environment may be restricted to leakages from prior disposals of hazardous wastes. If released to soil or water, biodegradation may be the major degradation process. A single biodegradation study has shown that p-nitrobiphenyl is significantly biodegradable with rapid microbial adaptation. Photodegradation may occur in water, in air, or on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight; however, kinetic rate data pertaining to environmental photolysis are not available to predict its relative significance. Estimated Koc values of 2680-3360 indicate that leaching in soil should not be important; in addition, some partitioning from the water column to aquatic sediments and suspended material may occur. If released to air, p-nitrobiphenyl will react in the vapor-phase with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals at an estimated half-life rate of 6.8 days in an average atmosphere. Human exposure to p-nitrobiphenyl may be possible through contact with hazardous waste which was disposed of in past years. (SRC)",

A single biodegradation study has shown that p-nitrobiphenyl is significantly biodegradable with rapid microbial adaptation. p-Nitrobiphenyl has also been shown to photodegrade rapidly when diethylamine solutions are exposed to uv light above 290 nm. Photolysis in water may be important; however, kinetic rate data pertaining to environmental photolysis are not available to predict its relative significance. Estimated Koc values of 2680-3360 indicate that some partitioning from the water column to sediments and suspended material may occur. Moderate bioconcentration may be possible. Aquatic volatilization is expected to be relatively slow in comparison to other fate processes. Aquatic hydrolysis is not expected to be important. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value of Henry's Law Constant indicates slow volatilization from environmental waters, although volatilization from shallow rivers may have some significance(2). The volatilization half-life from a model river (1 meter deep flowing 1 m/sec with a wind speed of 3 m/sec) has been estimated to be 14.8 days(2,SRC); however, this estimation neglects the potentially significant effect of adsorption(SRC). The volatilization half-life from an environmental pond, which considers the effect of adsorption, can be estimated to be 1453 days(3,SRC); if parameters are introduced into the pond model to exclude the adsorption effects of p-nitrobiphenyl's log Kow of 3.77, the volatilization half-life is reduced to 160 days(SRC).",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

On the first day, 10% of the hexabromobenzene dose and 5% of the hexachlorobenzene dose was detected in the feces; very minimal excretion of hexabromobenzene in feces was found subsequently. By day four, cumulative excretion of hexabromobenzene and hexachlorobenzene plateaued at about 10% of the given dose, indicating a similar course of intestinal absorption for both chemicals. Urinary excretion did not appear to be a significant route of excretion for either compound. Concentrations of hexabromobenzene and hexachlorobenzene in blood were nearly the same during the first 8 hours but diverged after day one and indicated a faster metabolism of hexabromobenzene. Rapid metabolism of hexabromobenzene was also shown by the concentration curve in liver; the highest liver concentrations were found within 1 hour of administration. Maximum hexachlorobenzene concentrations appeared 4 to 24 hours after administration. The hexabromobenzene concentration curve in the kidney was similar to that of the liver, thus hexabromobenzene might be carried from the liver to kidney directly, indicating that kidney has no, or very little, metabolic capacity for hexabromobenzene. In adipose tissue, the course patterns of concentration of hexabromobenzene and hexachlorobenzene were similar but the concentration of hexachlorobenzene was much higher. The elimination of hexabromobenzene from the rat body was clearly biphasic, while that of hexachlorobenzene was not. The half lives for hexachlorobenzene were 0.7 for phase-I and 48 days for phase-II and the half life for hexachlorobenzene was 20 days.",

In general, the trihalogenated benzenes increased the LD50 of all 4 insecticides 2- to 6-fold. These increases were larger than those observed with the di- or hexahalogenated isomers. The bromide-substituted benzenes were usually more active than the chlorinated ones with the exception being hexabromobenzene. There was a good correlation between their effects on lethality and increases in in vitro carboxylesterase activity with either-malathion or malaoxon as the substrate. The trihalogenated benzenes decreased the inhibitory effect of malathion on cholinesterase activity in the brain and to a lesser degree in the red blood cells, but not in 1iver or plasma.",

If released to the atmosphere, hexabromobenzene will exist solely in the particulate phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on an estimated vapor pressure of 1.6X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Particulate-phase hexabromobenzene may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition. An estimated Koc value of 48,000 suggests that hexabromobenzene will be immobile in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected given the vapor pressure of this compound. Based on limited data, hexabromobenzene is expected to be resistant to microbial degradation in both soil and aquatic environments; 8 and 10% biodegradation was reported for river water and seawater, respectively, after a 3 day incubation. In water, hexabromobenzene should adsorb to sediment or particulate matter based on its Koc value. This compound may volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 32 days, respectively, although adsorption to sediment and particulate matter may attenuate this process. The volatilization half-life from a model pond, taking into account adsorptive processes, is 114 months. Information on the bioaccumulation of hexabromobenzene in fish is conflicting with biocentration potential ranges from low to very high. In short-term studies, hexabromobenzene was non-accumulative in fish. However, in a 96 day study using rainbow trout, a mean BCF value of 1,100 was measured. It was suggested that non-accumulation was due to the size of hexabromobenzene, resulting in a lack of membrane permeation. Occupational exposure to hexabromobenzene may occur by dermal contact or respiratory routes during its production and use as a flame retardant. Exposure to the general population may occur by dermal contact with commercial products which contain this compound. (SRC)",

In Japan, hexabromobenzene is used as a flame retardant in items such as plastics, paper, and electric manufactured goods(2). Hexabromobenzene may also enter the environment as a result of the high temperature breakdown of octabromodiphenyl ether, decabromodiphenyl ether, pentabromophenol, and hexabromobiphenyl, all which are used as flame retardants(3). Hexabromobenzene was formed during the pyrolysis of decabromodiphenyl oxide(4). Accidental fire residues in private residences contained 1,3,5-tribromobenzene, 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene, and hexabromobenzene as an unquantitated mixture(5). Hexabromobenzene may be formed during the natural debromination of decabromobiphenyl ether during photolysis(6).",

Hexabromobenzene may volatilize from water surfaces(1,SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(3). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 and 32 days, respectively(1,SRC), although adsorption to sediment and particulate matter may attenuate this process(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model pond, taking into account adsorptive processes, is 114 months(8). Conflicting data are available on the bioconcentration of hexabromobenzene in fish and aquatic organisms. In short-term studies (4-16 days), hexabromobenzene was found to be non-accumulative in fish(4,5); however, in a 96 day study using rainbow trout, a mean bioconcentration factor of 1,100 was obtained(6). It was suggested that non-accumulation of this compound in guppies was due to the size of hexabromobenzene, resulting in a lack of membrane permeation(4). Based on limited data, this compound is expected to be resistant to biodegradation(7); 8 and 10% biodegradation was reported for river water and seawater inocula, respectively, after a 3 day incubation(9).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) did not take up hexabromobenzene from either water or contaminated food over a 4 day period(1). This compound did not bioconcentrate in 1 year old male guppies (Poecilia reticulat) following a 16 day exposure period(2); the lack of bioconcentration was thought to be due to the size of this molecule resulting in a lack of membrane permeation(2). Hexabromobenzene was listed as a chemical compound confirmed to be non-accumulative in screening studies(3), and hexabromobenzene has been reported to have a bioconcentration factor (BCF) of approximately 10(4). In a 96 day experiment in a flow-through tank, hexabromobenzene had a mean BCF in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) of 1,100(5); in the first 7 days of this experiment, no hexabromobenzene was detected in whole fish samples(5). According to a classification scheme(6), these BCF values suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms can range from low in short term studies to very high in long term studies(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that hexabromobenzene will volatilize from water surfaces(2,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 3 days(2,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 32 days(2,SRC). However, the expected strong adsorption of hexabromobenzene to sediment and suspended organic matter may attenuate the rate of this process considerably. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond, which takes into account adsorption processes, is 114 months(3,SRC). Similarly, volatilization from moist soil is not expected to occur(SRC). The estimated vapor pressure, 1.6X10-8 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4,SRC), suggests that volatilization from dry soil to the atmosphere will not be a significant process(SRC).",

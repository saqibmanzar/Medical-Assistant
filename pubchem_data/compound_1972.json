PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Although clinical experience with amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex, amphotericin B lipid complex, and amphotericin B liposomal is limited to date, these drugs appear to be better tolerated than conventional IV amphotericin B. As with conventional IV amphotericin B, the most frequent adverse reactions to amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex, amphotericin B lipid complex, or amphotericin B liposomal are acute infusion reactions; however, data accumulated to date indicate that lipid-based and liposomal formulations of amphotericin B may be associated with a lower overall incidence of adverse effects and a lower incidence of hematologic and renal toxicity than the conventional formulation of the drug.",

These reactions are most severe and occur most frequently with initial doses and usually lessen with subsequent doses. Fever (with or without shaking chills) may occur as soon as 15-20 minutes after IV infusions of conventional amphotericin B are started. The majority of patients receiving conventional IV amphotericin B (50-90%) exhibit some degree of intolerance to initial doses of the drug, even when therapy is initiated with low doses. Although these reactions become less frequent following subsequent doses or administration of the drug on alternate days, they recur if conventional IV amphotericin B therapy is interrupted and then reinstituted.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Amphotericin B exerts its antifungal activity principally by binding to sterols (e.g., ergosterol) in the fungal cell membrane. As a result of this binding, the cell membrane is no longer able to function as a selective barrier and leakage of intracellular contents occurs. Cell death occurs in part as a result of permeability changes, but other mechanisms also may contribute to the in vivo antifungal effects of amphotericin B against some fungi. Amphotericin B is not active in vitro against organisms that do not contain sterols in their cell membranes (eg, bacteria).",

In adults and pediatric patients who did not receive cyclosporine or tacrolimus therapy, the incidence of renal toxicity was 8% in those who received amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex and 35% in those who received conventional amphotericin B.",

When more than 5 mg are injected subconjunctivally, a severe local reaction results with permanent yellow discoloration of the conjunctiva and formation of raised nodules that are slow in resolving. Injected into the anterior chamber in rabbits, 0.5 mg severely damaged the corneal endothelium, but 25 ug or 50 ug did not. When injected into the vitreous body in rabbits, some investigators report 5 to 10 ug to be non toxic, while others have reported inflammation, cataract and retinal detachment and necrosis from as little as 1 or 2 ug.[Grant, W.M.

The concn of amphotericin B and its methyl derivative in the amniotic cavity on days 13, 14 and 15 of pregnancy were 1.5 and 36 ug/mL, respectively. When administered iv during the preimplantation period the antibiotics had no embryotoxic action. Iv administration of amphotericin B in a dose of 500 ug/kg and its derivative in a dose of 2000 ug/kg during organ genesis induced a decrease in the craniocaudal size. In a dose of 3000 ug/kg administered iv the methyl derivative of amphotericin B induced an increase in postimplantation death rates. Administration of amphotericin B to the amniotic cavity had no damaging action. Administration of the methyl derivative on day 15 of pregnancy led to anomalous development of the lower extremities and slower ossification. The threshold doses by the embryotoxic action for iv administration are 500 ug/kg for amphotericin B and 2000 ug/kg for the methyl derivative. Administration of the antibiotics to the amniotic cavity revealed potential teratogenic properties of the amphotericin B methyl derivative.[Moguchenok EA; Antibiot Khimioter 37 (3): 25-8 (1992)]",

Light and electron microscopy confirmed a greater neurotoxicity for amphotericin B, manifested as edema and modest gliosis extending along and beyond the injection tract. Neuronal degeneration and myelin damage were present in amphotericin B treated (1 mg/mL) animals but were present only modestly in animals treated with amphotericin B mono methyl ester at a fivefold greater concn. Iv administration of amphotericin B to adult female Wistar rats as five daily doses of 5 mg/kg of body wt resulted in significant wt loss and some deaths. Histopathologic examination of the brains, spinal cords, and sural nerves of surviving animals revealed neurotoxicity manifested by neuronal degeneration, gliosis, and myelin edema. In sharp contrast, similar treatment with amphotericin B mono methyl ester at a 10 fold greater dose resulted in neither death nor significant neurotoxicity. The administration of five daily doses of a mixture of amphotericin B mono methyl ester-amphotericin B (9:1; wt/wt) at 50 mg/kg of body wt resulted in neurotoxicity. These results indicate that amphotericin B exhibits significantly greater in vivo neurotoxicity than amphotericin B mono methyl ester.[Reuhl KR et al; Antimicrob Agents Chemother 37 (3): 419-28 (1993)]",

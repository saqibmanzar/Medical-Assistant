ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

Plasma concentrations of meprobamate required for sedative or hypnotic effects are not known. Oral administration of 400 mg of meprobamate produces peak plasma concentrations of 5-39 ug/mL within 1-3 hr. Plasma concentrations of 30-100 ug/mL are usually reached following mild overdosage and are associated with stupor or light coma. Plasma concentrations of 100-200 ug/mL are associated with deep coma and are potentially lethal; fatalities frequently occur when plasma concentrations exceed 200 ug/mL. The onset of sedative action is usually less than 1 hour following oral administration of meprobamate.",

Most studies on carisoprodol metabolism have been carried out on individuals phenotyped for CYP2C19 activity using the probe drug S-mephenytoin. /The investigators/ aimed to investigate whether the ratio of carisoprodol to meprobamate in a 'real life' setting could be predicted by CYP2C19 genotype or, more specifically, if high carisoprodol : meprobamate ratios in drugged drivers could be ascribed to the presence of mutant CYP2C19 alleles. From original material comprising 358 blood samples from apprehended drivers, two polarized groups were selected; a high-ratio group of 11 subjects where the carisoprodol : meprobamate ratio was >1 and a low-ratio control group of 23 subjects where the ratio was <0.31. Genotyping was carried out for the CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3 and CYP2C19*4 alleles. DNA samples from 94 healthy blood donors were used as reference material. The number of mutant alleles in the high-ratio and low-ratio groups was significantly higher and lower, respectively, than in the reference material. The increased number of mutant alleles in the high-ratio group was not due to the presence of many poor metabolizers, but to a high number of heterozygous individuals with the genotype CYP2C19*1/*2. This result indicates a gene dosage effect where the carisoprodol : meprobamate ratio reflects the number of active CYP2C19 alleles. The metabolism of carisoprodol to meprobamate is dependent on CYP2C19 genotype. Heterozygous individuals with the CYP2C19*1/*2 genotype have a reduced capacity for metabolizing carisoprodol, and should probably be regarded as intermediate metabolizers of this drug. /Carisoprodol/",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

While instances of clinically apparent liver injury due to meprobamate have been mentioned in review articles, no cases with specific information on clinical features have appeared in the published literature.

Meprobamate is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system and has major potential for drug-drug interactions. Meprobamate can exacerbate symptoms of porphyria. Serious allergic reactions to meprobamate have been reported including Stevens Johnson syndrome. In cases of meprobamate overdose, the cause of death has been respiratory suppression and not liver failure, although liver histology was not well defined.",

Rats were treated orally with MPB (maintenance dosage = 800 mg/kg X 2/day), PHB (100 X 2) or COD (50 X 2) twice a day (10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.) for a total of 21 days; the treatment was ceased for 3 days after administration for 7 days, and the last dosing was performed on day 27. During intoxication and after the withdrawal, the MPB treated rats exhibited behaviour and withdrawal signs similar to those seen in the PHB treated rats, but not the COD treated rats. After withdrawal of drugs, definite weight loss was observed in all the rats given drugs, and the recovery of the MPB and PHB treated rats was clearly later than that of the COD treated rats. A long-lasting increase in rectal temperature was observed after the withdrawal in the MPB and PHB treated rats; a decrease was seen in the COD treated rats. From these results, it is concluded that definite physical dependence on MPB, similar to that on PHB but different from that on COD, was developed after repeated oral administration for a total of 21 days in the rat.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.0X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates meprobamate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase meprobamate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 20 hrs. Meprobamate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, meprobamate is expected to high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 60. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Meprobamate may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Meprobamate has been classified as non-biodegradable. If released into water, meprobamate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to meprobamate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where meprobamate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to meprobamate via inhalation or ingestion of contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with this compound or other consumer products containing meprobamate. Exposure to meprobamate among the general population may also be due to those administered the drug, an anxiolytic. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

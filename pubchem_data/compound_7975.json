PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Thus, with a few exceptions, isolation of pure pyridine bases was expensive. Today, almost all pyridine bases are produced by synthesis. /Pridine bases/",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

It is used as organic intermediate for rubber and dye chemicals, solvent, laboratory reagent. 2-Methylpyridine is a chemical intermediate for the synthesis of: 2-amino-6-methylpyridine; betahistine; bis-acodyl; clopyralid; 2-methylpiperidine; perhexiline; picloram; picolinic acid; thioridazine; 2-vinylpyridine. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: 2-Methylpyridine causes local irritation on contact with the skin, mucous membranes and cornea. Clinical signs of intoxication caused by the methylpyridines include weight loss, diarrhea, weakness, ataxia and unconsciousness as well as CNS depression, headache, giddiness and vomiting. Chronic exposure to methylpyridine results in anemia and ocular and facial paralysis in addition to the previously mentioned symptoms. It has been alleged that the workmen exposed to picoline vapors may develop diplopia as a result of disturbance of the eye muscles. ANIMAL STUDIES: Eye and skin irritant in rabbits. Chronic administration to rats decreased glycogen level and  increased glucose and lactic acid levels in liver of rats throughout most of the study. In developmental study in rats structure and composition of the liver and the structure andgrowth pattern of the skin were disrupted in the offspring. 2-Methylpyridine affected electrophysiological parameters in rats. Ames test with and without metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, TA97, TA102, 10-5000 ug/plate was negative.",

Methylpyridine is an intermediate in the dye and resins industry, solvent (2-, 3- and 4-Methylpyridine). HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Clinical symptoms and signs of intoxication include gastrointestinal disturbance with diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, weakness, headache, insomnia, and nervousness. ANIMAL STUDIES: Methylpyridine is a skin irritant in rabbits. The changes observed in neurophysiological test in rats following methylpyridine administration were in many ways similar to those seen following administration of depressant compounds: increased latency of evoked potentials and increased latency to pentylenetetrazol seizures. In viro substituted pyridines influence the binding of nicotine to rat brain preparations.",

Most of the effects observed in humans are seen after repeated or intermittent exposure to the vapor. Clinical symptoms and signs of intoxication include gastrointestinal disturbance with diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, weakness, headache, insomnia, and nervousness; at low concentrations, pyridine causes varying degress of liver damage with central lobular fatty degeneration, congestion, and cellular infiltration. Pyridine causes irritation upon contact with skin, mucous membranes, and cornea. Safety measures include handling pyridine under well ventilated conditions. A charcoal gas mask cannister is effective in adsorbing pyridine. In the event of skin contact, the contaminated area should be washed with soap and water. Precautions recommended for pyridine are also applicable to its derivatives and homologs.",

Following either 7 or 14 days the rabbits were killed and histological examinations were conducted on the eyes. Eye irritation, caused by these exposures, was characterized by ocular irritation indice (OII). Eye irritation assessments showed that irritation was maximal either 1 hr or 1 day after exposure. Based upon ocular irritation indice values, 2-picoline, 3-picoline and pyridine were classified as \"irritating\", while 4-picoline was classified a \"severely irritating\". ... Over longer periods of time, which included recovery, all four of these compounds were determined to be \"severely irritating\". Histological examination of the eyes showed similar effects for all four compounds considered. These effects included keratitis lesions in corneal epithelial tissue, fibrillary edematous lamallae dissociation, and cellular inflammatory infiltration. Skin irritation was characterized by the cutaneous primary irritation index (PII). 2-Picoline, 3-picoline, and pyridine had primary irritation index values of 5.8, 6.8, and 4.8 respectively, while 4-picoline showed such high percutaneous toxicity that a PII value could not be determined. Overall results on skin irritation suggested that 2-picoline and 3-picoline should be classified as \"severely irritating\" with pyridine being classified as \"irritating\". Histological exam of the skin provided evidence for necrosis, ulceration, and regeneration. ...",

Following either 7 or 14 days the rabbits were killed and histological examinations were conducted on the eyes. Eye irritation, caused by these exposures, was characterized by ocular irritation indice (OII). Eye irritation assessments showed that irritation was maximal either 1 hour or 1 day after exposure. Based upon ocular irritation indice values, 2-picoline, 3-picoline and pyridine were classified as \"irritating\", while 4-picoline was classified a \"severely irritating\". ... Over longer periods of time, which included recovery, all four of these compounds were determined to be \"severely irritating\". Histological examination of the eyes showed similar effects for all four compounds considered. These effects included keratitis lesions in corneal epithelial tissue, fibrillary edematous lamallae dissociation, and cellular inflammatory infiltration. Skin irritation was characterized by the cutaneous primary irritation index (PII). 2-Picoline, 3-picoline, and pyridine had primary irritation index values of 5.8, 6.8, and 4.8 respectively, while 4-picoline showed such high percutaneous toxicity that a primary irritation index value could not be determined. Overall results on skin irritation suggested that 2-picoline and 3-picoline should be classified as \"severely irritating\" with pyridine being classified as \"irritating\". Histological exam of the skin provided evidence for necrosis, ulceration, and regeneration. ...",

The tests contained measures of sensory function (paired pulse flash evoked potentials, pattern reversal evoked potentials, and brainstem auditory evoked responses) and cerebral excitability (pentylenetetrazol seizures and hippocampal afterdischarges). In general, rats treated with 2- and 3-methylpyridine were more affected than those treated with 4-methylpyridine. The changes observed were in many ways similar to those seen following administration of depressant compounds: increased latency of evoked potentials and increased latency to PTZ seizures. Not all findings, however, were consistent with previously observed patterns of central nervous system depression.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 11.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2-methylpyridine will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2-methylpyridine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6 days. 2-Methylpyridine does not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2-methylpyridine is expected to have very high to moderate mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 4 to 215. The pKa of 2-methylpyridine is 5.96, indicating that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. In the soil tests, lowest adsorption occurred when 2-methylpyridine was in non-ionized form. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 9.96X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 2-Methylpyridine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Results of various biodegradation studies indicate that 2-methylpyridine generally biodegrades readily under aerobic conditions, but biodegradation occurs much slower under anaerobic conditions. 2-Methylpyridine was completely biodegraded in 2 weeks in one aerobic surface soil while in anaerobic surface soil only 10% biodegradation was reported in 3 months. If released into water, 2-methylpyridine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 and 30 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. 2-Methylpyridine has been shown to biodegrade rapidly in aerobic groundwater with complete biodegradation observed after 4 days. In anaerobic estuarine sediment, 2-methylpyridine was not biodegraded over a 100-day period. Occupational exposure to 2-methylpyridine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2-methylpyridine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2-methylpyridine via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water. Since 2-methylpyridine has been identified as a component of cigarette smoke, people who smoke or inhale second-hand smoke may be exposed to higher levels of 2-methylpyridine than the general population.

Methylpyridines are also released to the environment with the manufacture and use of coal-derived liquid fuels and during the disposal of coal liquefication and gasification waste byproducts. Methylpyridines occur in cigarette smoke. If released to air, vapor pressures ranging from 5.77 to 11.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C for the three isomers indicate that methylpyridines will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methylpyridines will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6-7 days. Methylpyridines do not absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, are not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methylpyridines are expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 115. The pKa of the methylpyridine isomers ranges 5.63 to 5.98, indicating that methylpyridines will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant range of 6.0X10-6 to 9.96X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. Methylpyridines are expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon the vapor pressure. Methylpyridines may biodegrade fairly rapidly under aerobic conditions in both soil and water. Methylpyridines are expected to be resistant to biodegradation under some anaerobic conditions. Acclimation of microbes may be important as demonstrated by complete degradation in 2 weeks in polluted soil versus 3 months in unpolluted soil. If released into water, methylpyridines are not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon the Henry's Law constants of the three isomers. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 to 6 and 37 to 47 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since methylpyridines lack functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. In water, methylpyridines were rapidly biodegraded in acclimated aerobic natural waters with complete removal within 2 to 4 days. In sulfidogenic estuarine sediments, however, methylpyridine was not biodegraded over 200 days. Occupational exposure to methylpyridines may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with these compounds at workplaces where methylpyridines are produced or used or where coal-derived or petroleum fuels are produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methylpyridines via inhalation of ambient air, either passive or active inhalation of cigarette smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing methylpyridines.

The pKa of 2-methylpyridine is 5.96(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). In the Eurosoil tests, lowest adsorption occurred when 2-methylpyridine was in non-ionized form(2). Volatilization of the neutral species of 2-methylpyridine from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important  fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 9.96X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(5). 2-Methylpyridine is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 11.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(6). Results of various biodegradation studies indicate that 2-methylpyridine generally biodegrades readily under aerobic conditions, but biodegradation occurs much slower under anaerobic ocnditions(7). In one aerobic soil study, 97.3% biodegradation of 2-methylpyridine occurred when incubated in a silt loam soil for 16 days(8). 2-Methylpyridine was completely biodegraded in 2 weeks in an aerobic surface soil while in anaerobic surface soil only 10% biodegradation was reported in 3 months(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of  9.96X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 and 30 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 1.11(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Low bioconcentration was reported for BCF tests using carp (Cyprinus carpio)(8). Results of various biodegradation studies indicate that 2-methylpyridine generally biodegrades readily under aerobic conditions, but biodegradation occurs much slower under anaerobic ocnditions(9). 2-Methylpyridine was completely biodegraded in 4 days in aerobic groundwater(10). In sulfidogenic estuarine sediments, 2-methylpyridine was not biodegraded over a 100-day period(11). 2-Methylpyridine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). The UV absorption spectrum of 2-methylpyridine in aqueous solution shows no absorption >290 nm(12); therefore, 2-methylpyridine is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The pKa of 2-, 3- and 4-methylpyridine are 5.96, 5.63 and 5.98, respectively(3), indicating that methylpyridines will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Soil studies with 2-methylpyridine(5) demonstrated that Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form(5). Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given Henry's Law constant values ranging from 6.0X10-6 to 9.96X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(6). Methylpyridines are expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure ranging from 5.77 to 11.2 mm Hg for the three isomers(7). Methylpyridines are expected to biodegrade fairly rapidly in aerobic soil; however, under anaerobic conditions, this compound may be persistent(8,9). 3-Methylpyridine and 4-methylpyridine were added to Fincastle silt loam; 69.3% (in 32 days) and 71.7% biodegradation to inorganic nitrogen (in 16 days), respectively, was observed(8). Methylpyridines are expected to be resistant to anaerobic biodegradation; no biodegradation was reported over 200 days in sulfidogenic sediments(10). Acclimation of microbes may be important as demonstrated by complete degradation of 4-methylpyridine in 2 weeks in polluted soil versus 3 months in unpolluted soil(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon Henry's Law constant values of 6.0X10-6 to 9.96X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 to 6 and 37 to 47, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from log Kow values of 1.11, 1.20 and 1.22(6), for 2-, 3- and 4-methylpyridine, respectively, and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Methylpyridines may biodegrade fairly rapidly in aerobic waters; however, under anaerobic conditions, these compounds are expected to be persistent. In an aerobic river die-away test, 3- and 4-methylpyridine were rapidly biodegraded (complete biodegradation in 2 to 4 days) after acclimation in highly polluted natural waters(7). Methylpyridines areexpected to be resistant to anaerobic biodegradation; no biodegradation was reported over 200 days in sulfidogenic sediments(8). Methylpyridines are not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). The UV absorption spectrum of the methylpyridine isomers in aqueous solution shows no absorption >290 nm(9); therefore, methylpyridines are not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Complete biodegradation of 2-methylpyridine, initially added at 4 mg/L, was reported in aerobic groundwater incubated at 15 \u00b0C for 4 days(4). In an aerobic column study where subsurface sediment was leached with contaminated groundwater, 65% of the initially applied 2-methylpyridine was removed after 5 weeks of operation(5). Complete biodegradation of 2-methylpyridine was observed in 24 days following incubation in a defined medium inoculated with soil(6).

Each compound was added to soil at 2 mmol kg/L. Compounds studied included pyridine substituted with one or two hydroxyl, carboxyl, chlorine, amine, or methyl groups. During the 64 day incubation, extractability of pyridine derivatives with 2 M potassium chloride 0.01 M hydrogen chloride decreased from an average of 88 + or - 8.8% to essentially 0 for all compounds except aminopyridines. ... Degradation of the majority of pyridine derivatives was confirmed by accumulation of nitrogen amounts equivalent to 61 to 80% of the decrease in extractable pyridines at 64 days of incubation. ... Aminopyridines resisted degradation in soil while methylpyridines were degraded in 8 to 32 days. Degradability of the compounds generally followed the order pyridine-carboxylic acids > pyridine = mono- hydroxypridines > methylpyridines > aminopyridines and chloropyridines.",

However, the 3-methylpyridine was not biodegraded as rapidly as 4-methylpyridine, suggesting that a methyl group in the meta-position inhibits aerobic biodegradation. Methylpyridines were added to Fincastle silt loam (Aeric Ochraqualf) with a pH of 6.7 and incubated at 25 \u00b0C(1). Within 32 days, 69.3% of the available nitrogen from 3-methylpyridine was released to inorganic forms(1). Within 16 and 32 days, 71.7% and 100%, respectively, of the available nitrogen from 4-methylpyridine was released to inorganic forms(1). Respective sterilized controls lost 11.7% and 21.8% of the starting materials to volatilization; but, did not release inorganic nitrogen(1). An aerobic river die-away test also showed that 3- and 4-methylpyridine biodegraded rapidly after acclimation in highly polluted natural waters maintained at 20 \u00b0C(2). After 14- and 18-day acclimation periods, 100% of the original concentration of 1 ppm of 3-methylpyridine was removed within 2 and 4 days from the Ohio and Little Miami River waters, respectively(2). In groundwater samples collected near an oil shale facility(elevated alkylpyridine levels) no degradation occurred for 10 days after a soil inoculum was added; 3% remained at 17 days and <1% at 24 days. Without the soil inoculum, degradation was much slower and 19% remained at 31 days(3). Methylpyridines are only very slowly degraded in sulfur-reducing and methanogenic groundwater aquifer slurries; no degradation occurred after one month. 46% and <8% remained under sulfate-reducing conditions after 3 and 8 months, respectively, for the fastest reacting isomer (2-methylpyridine)(4). Methylpyridine isomers were incubated in sulfidogenic estuarine sediments at concentrations from 70 to 80 uM; no biodegradation was reported over 200 days for any isomer(5). In an anaerobic biodegradation study using sludge from a wastewater treatment plant digester as inoculum, 2-, 3- and 4-methylpyridine were found to have poor biodegradability(6).",

Under denitrifying and sulfate-reducing conditions, approximately 40 to 50% and 10% degradation of 4-methylpyridine was reported in 3 months in an unpolluted surface and subsurface soil, respectively(1). In polluted aerobic surface and subsurface soils, degradation was complete within 2 weeks(1). Under denitrifying conditions, 65 and 20% degradation were reported after 3 months for polluted surface and subsurface soils, respectively; under sulfate-reducing conditions, 90 and 100% degradation was reported after 3 months for polluted surface and subsurface soils, respectively(1).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The pKa values of 2-, 3-, and 4-methylpyridine are 5.96, 5.63 and 5.98, respectively(3), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(4). Soil studies with 2-methylpyridine demonstrated that Koc can vary with pH with lowest adsorption occurring in the non-ionized form(5).",

Methylpyridines are weak bases with pKa values of 6.00(4), 5.63(5) and 5.98(5) for the 2-, 3-, and 4-methylpyridine isomers, respectively, indicating that these compound will partially exist in the protonated form in acidic conditions, and no volatilization from water or moist soil will occur for the cation(SRC).",

Occupational exposure to methylpyridines may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with these compounds at workplaces where methylpyridinesis produced or used(SRC). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methylpyridines via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of cigarette smoke, ingestion of food and contaminated drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing methylpyridines(SRC).

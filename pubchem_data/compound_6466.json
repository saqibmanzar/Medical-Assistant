PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA, as amended in 1988, were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern.

Rats of both sexes were fed diets containing Gibberellic Acid (GA3, purity 88.5%) at concentrations of 0, 1,000, 10,000, or 50,000 ppm for 13 weeks. A group of control animals and high-dose animals were fed regular rodent diet for an additional 4-week recovery period. The consumption of test materials was 53-117, 550-1178, or 2994-5786 mg/kg/day (males) and 67-130, 730-1283, or 3872-6241 mg/kg/day (females). The only treatment-related clinical sign of toxicity was a low incidence of soft stools in both sexes receiving the highest dose. Very slightly decreased body weight gains were observed in mid-dose males and high dose animals of both sexes. Slightly increased total food consumption in all treated groups were observed. Evidence suggestive of a compound-related effect on kidney function included significantly increased blood urea nitrogen levels (BUN) and increased relative kidney weights in female rats in the high-dose group. BUN levels and kidney weights were comparable to controls at the end of a 4-week recovery period, indicating reversibility of renal effects. Other effects observed in high-dose males included decreased globulin levels at termination of the study and decreased glucose levels (p</= 0.05) at the end of the 4-week recovery period. increased relative liver weights were observed in males at 50,000 ppm and in females at 10,000 ppm and 50,000 ppm. At the end of the recovery period, increased relative liver weight were still evident in females (11%), but not in males. In the absence of clinical chemistry correlates and gross and microscopic hepatic abnormalities, the liver weight changes are considered compensatory rather than a toxic effect of the test material. Under the conditions of this study, the NOEL is 10,000 ppm; the LOEL is 50,000 ppm, based on the occurrence of soft stools in both sexes, and increased BUN levels, liver and kidney weights in females. /Gibberellic acid, purity 88.5%/",

Rats were fed diets containing 0, 1,000, 10,000 or 25,000 ppm Gibberellins (GA4+GA7, purity 85.5%) for 13 weeks. Additional groups of 10 control and 10 high-dose animals were held for a 4-week recovery period. The 25,000 ppm exposure group was fed a diet containing 50,000 ppm during the first 14 days of the study; however, due to low weight gain and clinical signs the dosage was reduced for the duration of the study. The average calculated doses for the 1,000, 10,000, and 25,000 ppm groups, the latter corrected for exposure to 50,000 ppm, were 67, 704, and 2238 mg/kg/day for males and 85, 814, and 2403 mg/kg/day for females. No treatment-related effects were observed at the 1,000 or 10,000 ppm dietary levels. One male in the 25,000 ppm treatment group died during the third week of the study. Compare to controls, treatment of rats of both sexes at 25,000 ppm had significant effects on clinical signs, food consumption (during the first 5 weeks of the study), body weight, organ-to-body weight ratios, hematology, clinical chemistry and gross microscopic pathology. Clinical signs in the high-dose groups included hunched posture, thin rough coat, a body crust on the nose and urine stains. Body weights for males and females were significantly lower than controls throughout the study, including the recovery phase. There was a marked increase in body weights when the treatment was reduced from 50,000 to 25,000 ppm after 14 days, and by the end of the recovery period at week 17, body weights were within 91% of control groups for both sexes. Males had significantly decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit values and significantly lower total bilirubin, cholesterol, and alkaline phosphatase values. Females had significantly lower total protein, albumin and calcium values and significantly higher globulin, total bilirubin, cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase values. Both sexes had significantly increased relative brain weights and males had significantly increased relative kidney and testis weights. Gross pathological changes in the kidneys (rough surfaces and depressed areas in the cortex) were present in both sexes. Histologically, chronic tubular nephritis, tubular dilation, and focal loss of nephrons were observed. Histological changes in the liver were marginal in incidence and severity. Under the conditions of the study, the NOEL is 10,000 ppm; the LOEL is 25,000 ppm based on alterations in clinical chemistry, decreased food consumption, decreased body weights, increases in relative organ weights (brain, kidney, and testis), and gross and histopathological changes in the kidney. /Gibberellins, purity 85.5%/",

Gibberellic acid is produced by several molds, principally Gibberella fujikuroi. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.1X10-13 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates gibberellic acid will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase gibberellic acid will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. If released to soil, gibberellic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 32. The pKa of gibberellic acid is 4, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb to organic carbon and clay more strongly than the undissociated acid. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.6X10-15 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization of gibberellic acid is attenuated by the ionic form. Gibberellic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Degradation of gibberellic acid in soil is approximately 85% in five days and >90% in ten days incubated at 24 \u00b0C in the dark. If released into water, gibberellic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. A pKa of 4 indicates gibberellic acid will exist almost entirely in an anion form at pH values of 5 to 9. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to gibberellic acid may occur through inhalation of powder and dermal contact with this compound at work places where gibberellic acid is produced or used. Gibberellic acid is mostly used on grape, citrus, and apple crops, but has also been used on a variety of other crops. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

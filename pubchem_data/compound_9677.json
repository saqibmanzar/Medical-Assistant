Nandrolone enters the cell and binds to and activates specific nuclear androgen receptors in responsive tissue, including the prostate, seminal vesicles, scrotum, penis, larynx, hair follicles, muscle, and bone. The resulting activated hormone receptor complex translocates into the nucleus and binds to androgen response elements (ARE) in the promoter region of targeted genes, where the complex promotes gene expression necessary for maintaining male sex characteristics. Mimicking the negative feedback mechanism of testosterone, nandrolone decanoate also suppresses the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH). Furthermore, this agent also stimulates erythropoietin production by enhancing the production of erythropoietic stimulating factors.",

The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium.  This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

In this work, the in vitro antifungal activity of dihydroxyacetone was tested against causative agents of dermatomycosis, more specifically against dermatophytes and Candida spp. The antifungal activity was determined by the broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines for yeasts and filamentous fungi. The data obtained show that the fungicidal activity varied from 1.6 to 50 mg/mL. DHA seems to be a promising substance for the treatment of dermatomycosis because it has antifungal properties at the same concentration used in artificial suntan lotions. Therefore, it is a potential low-toxicity antifungal agent that may be used topically because of its penetration into the corneal layers of the skin.",

Three groups of mice were UV-exposed four times a wk to a dose-equivalent of four times the standard erythema dose (SED), without or with application of 5 or 20% DHA only twice a week. Similarly, three groups of mice were treated with DHA and irradiated with a high UV dose (8 standard erythema dose), simulating a skin burn. Two groups (controls) were not irradiated, but either left untreated or treated with 20% DHA alone. The UV-induced skin pigmentation by melanogenesis could easily be distinguished from DHA-induced browning and was measured by a non-invasive, semi-quantitative method. Application of 20% DHA reduced by 63% the pigmentation produced by 4 standard erythema dose, however, only by 28% the pigmentation produced by 8 standard erythema dose. Furthermore, topical application of 20% DHA significantly delayed the time to appearance of the first tumor >or=1mm (P=0.0012) and the time to appearance of the third tumor (P=2 x 10(-6)) in mice irradiated with 4 standard erythema dose. However, 20% DHA did not delay tumor development in mice irradiated with 8 standard erythema dose. Application of 5% DHA did not influence pigmentation or photocarcinogenesis.",

To test the hypothesis that these three-carbon compounds would improve glycemic control in diabetes the effect of DHP on plasma glucose concentration, turnover, recycling, and tolerance in 7 women with noninsulin-dependent diabetes /was evaluated/. The subjects consumed a 1,500-calorie diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein), randomly containing 13% of the calories as DHP (1/1) or Polycose (placebo; PL), as a drink three times daily for 7 days. On the 8th day, primed continuous infusions of [6-(3)H]-glucose and [U-(14)C]-glucose were begun at 05.00 hr, and at 09.00 hr a 3-hr glucose tolerance test (75 g glucola) was performed. Two weeks later the subjects repeated the study with the other diet. The fasting plasma glucose level decreased by 14% with DHP (DHP = 8.0 + or - 0.9 mmol/L; PL = 9.3 + or - 1.0 mmol/L, p less than 0.05) which accounted for lower postoral glucose glycemia (DHP = 13.1 + or - 0.8 mmol/L, PL = 14.7 + or - 0.8 mmol/L, p less than 0.05). [6-(3)H]-glucose turnover (DHP = 1.50 + or - 0.19 mg/kg-L/min, PL = 1.77 + or - 0.21 mmg/kg-L/min, p less than 0.05) and glucose recycling, the difference in [6-(3)H]-glucose and [U-(14)C]-glucose turnover rates, decreased with DHP (DHP = 0.25 + or - 0.07 mg/kg-L/min, PL = 0.54 + or - 0.10 mg/kg-L/min, p less than 0.05).

DHA is subsequently converted into DHA phosphate (DHA-P) by an ATP- or phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent DHA kinase. Listeria innocua possesses two potential PEP-dependent Dha kinases. One is encoded by 3 of the 11 genes forming the glycerol (gol) operon. This operon also contains golD (lin0362), which codes for a new type of DHA-forming NAD(+)-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase. The subsequent metabolism of DHA requires its phosphorylation via the PEP:sugar phosphotransferase system components enzyme I, HPr, and EIIA(DHA)-2 (Lin0369). P-EIIA(DHA)-2 transfers its phosphoryl group to DhaL-2, which phosphorylates DHA bound to DhaK-2. The resulting Dha-P is probably metabolized mainly via the pentose phosphate pathway, because two genes of the gol operon encode proteins resembling transketolases and transaldolases. In addition, purified Lin0363 and Lin0364 exhibit ribose-5-P isomerase (RipB) and triosephosphate isomerase activities, respectively. The latter enzyme converts part of the DHA-P into glyceraldehyde-3-P, which, together with DHA-P, is metabolized via gluconeogenesis to form fructose-6-P. Together with another glyceraldehyde-3-P molecule, the transketolase transforms fructose-6-P into intermediates of the pentose phosphate pathway. The gol operon is preceded by golR, transcribed in the opposite orientation and encoding a DeoR-type repressor. Its inactivation causes the constitutive but glucose-repressible expression of the entire gol operon, including the last gene, encoding a pediocin immunity-like (PedB-like) protein. Its elevated level of synthesis in the golR mutant causes slightly increased immunity against pediocin PA-1 compared to the wild-type strain or a pedB-like deletion mutant.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

To test the hypothesis that these three-carbon compounds would improve glycemic control in diabetes the effect of DHP on plasma glucose concentration, turnover, recycling, and tolerance in 7 women with noninsulin-dependent diabetes /was evaluated/. The subjects consumed a 1,500-calorie diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein), randomly containing 13% of the calories as DHP (1/1) or Polycose (placebo; PL), as a drink three times daily for 7 days. On the 8th day, primed continuous infusions of [6-(3)H]-glucose and U-(14)C-glucose were begun at 05.00 hr, and at 09.00 hr a 3-hr glucose tolerance test (75 g glucola) was performed. Two weeks later the subjects repeated the study with the other diet. The fasting plasma glucose level decreased by 14% with DHP (DHP = 8.0 + or - 0.9 mmol/L; PL = 9.3 + or - 1.0 mmol/L, p less than 0.05) which accounted for lower postoral glucose glycemia (DHP = 13.1 + or - 0.8 mmol/L, PL = 14.7 + or - 0.8 mmol/L, p< 0.05). 6-(3)H-glucose turnover (DHP = 1.50 + or - 0.19 mg/kg-L/min, PL = 1.77 + or - 0.21 mmg/kg-L/min, p less than 0.05) and glucose recycling, the difference in 6-(3)H-glucose and U-(14)C-glucose turnover rates, decreased with DHP (DHP = 0.25 + or - 0.07 mg/kg-L/min, PL = 0.54 + or - 0.10 mg/kg-L/min, p< 0.05).

Oral DHA (2 and 4 g/kg) given to mice 10 min before injection (ip) of cyanide increased the LD50 values of cyanide from 5.7 mg/kg to 12 and 17.6 mg/kg, respectively. DHA prevented cyanide-induced lethality most effectively, if given orally 10-15 min before injection of cyanide. A combination of pretreatment with oral DHA (4 g/kg) and post-treatment with sodium thiosulfate (1 g/kg) increased the LD50 of cyanide by a factor of 9.9. Furthermore, DHA given intravenously to rabbits 5 min after subcutaneous injection of cyanide increased the LD50 of cyanide from 6 mg/kg to more than 11 mg/kg, while thiosulfate (1 g/kg) given intravenously 5 min after cyanide injection increased the LD50 of cyanide only to 8.5 mg/kg. DHA also prevented the convulsions that occurred after cyanide intoxication.",

Cyanide-induced convulsions were also prevented by DHA treatment, either alone or in combination with thiosulfate. Injection (ip) of DHA (2 g/kg) 2 min after or 10 min before CN (sc) increased LD50 values of CN (8.7 mg/kg) by factors of 2.1 and 3.0, respectively. Treatment with a combination of DHA and thiosulfate after CN increased the LD50 by a factor of 2.4. Pretreatment with a combination of DHA and thiosulfate (1 g/kg) increased the LD50 of CN to 83 mg/kg. Administration of alpha-ketoglutarate (2.0 g/kg), but not pyruvate, 2 min after CN increased the LD50 of CN by a factor of 1.6. Brain, heart and liver cytochrome oxidase activities were also measured following in vivo CN treatment with and without DHA. Pretreatment with DHA prevented the inhibition of cytochrome oxidase activity by CN and treatment with DHA after CN accelerated the recovery of cytochrome oxidase activity, especially in brain and heart homogenates ...",

To test the hypothesis that these three-carbon compounds would improve glycemic control in diabetes the effect of DHP on plasma glucose concentration, turnover, recycling, and tolerance in 7 women with noninsulin-dependent diabetes /was evaluated/. The subjects consumed a 1,500-calorie diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein), randomly containing 13% of the calories as DHP (1/1) or Polycose (placebo; PL), as a drink three times daily for 7 days. On the 8th day, primed continuous infusions of [6-(3)H]-glucose and U-(14)C-glucose were begun at 05.00 hr, and at 09.00 hr a 3-hr glucose tolerance test (75 g glucola) was performed. Two weeks later the subjects repeated the study with the other diet. The fasting plasma glucose level decreased by 14% with DHP (DHP = 8.0 + or - 0.9 mmol/L; PL = 9.3 + or - 1.0 mmol/L, p less than 0.05) which accounted for lower postoral glucose glycemia (DHP = 13.1 + or - 0.8 mmol/L, PL = 14.7 + or - 0.8 mmol/L, p< 0.05). 6-(3)H-glucose turnover (DHP = 1.50 + or - 0.19 mg/kg-L/min, PL = 1.77 + or - 0.21 mmg/kg-L/min, p less than 0.05) and glucose recycling, the difference in 6-(3)H-glucose and U-(14)C-glucose turnover rates, decreased with DHP (DHP = 0.25 + or - 0.07 mg/kg-L/min, PL = 0.54 + or - 0.10 mg/kg-L/min, p< 0.05). Fasting and postoral glucose, plasma insulin, glucagon, and C peptide levels were unaffected by DHP. /Mixture of dihydroxyacetone and pyruvate/.",

The effects of dihydroxyacetone (DHA) on cell survival and proliferation of a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT /were investigated/. Dose- and time-dependent morphological changes, chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic budding and cell detachment were seen in cells treated with DHA. Several dead cells were observed after long-time (24 hr) incubation with 25 mM DHA or more. Furthermore, an extensive decline in proliferation was observed 1 day after DHA exposure for 24 hr. When applied in different concentrations (5-50 mM) and for different time periods (1, 3 or 24 hr) DHA caused a G(2)/M block after the cyclin B(1) restriction point. Exit from this cell-cycle block was associated with massive apoptosis, as revealed by a clonogenic assay, TUNEL staining and electron microscopy. Furthermore, DHA caused DNA damage as revealed by the alkaline comet assay.",

Although this agent has been used extensively as safe sunless tanning, no published data are available to judge whether the abuse of DHAT causes a potential hazard to the human skin. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether frequent treatment with DHAT solutions had a deleterious effect on the wide skin surface of hairless descendants of Mexican hairless dogs. The skin reactions to the DHAT-treatment were investigated by daily clinical observations and histopathological examinations (21 and 42 days after the beginning of the DHAT-treatment). Clinical observations showed that skin color changes were apparent within 6 hr after the first treatment with 5% DHAT solutions, with maximal darkening between 12 and 24 hr. Twenty-one days after the beginning of the treatment with 5% DHAT solutions, the skin developed irritant dermatitis, and then the skin lesions gradually became severe during this study. Histopathological examinations showed entire epidermal thickening, 21 days after the beginning of the treatment with 5% DHAT solutions. Forty-two days after the beginning of the treatment with 5% DHAT solutions, the skin exhibited remarkable epidermal degeneration (hyperplastic and dyskeratotic changes) and moderate inflammatory reactions in the dermis. In severe dermatitic sites, found focal epidermal necrosis or interepidermal blister formation beneath the thickened parakeatotic corneum. Throughout this study, there were no clinical and histopathological changes in the sites treated with vehicle alone. These results revealed that the skin coloring generated by frequent wide treatments with DHAT caused severe contact dermatitis which was associated with the damaged stratum corneum.",

The control diet was a liquid diet with the following caloric composition: 14% protein, 28% fat, and 58% carbohydrate. The experimental diet was the same as the control diet except for the partial substitution of carbohydrate content with pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone. Rats receiving the experimental diet gained less weight than rats receiving the control diet. This reduction in body weight appeared to be largely the result of inhibition of lipid accumulation. The experimental diet reduced body fat content by 32% without any significant effect on either protein or water content. Rats receiving the experimental diet did not have increased loss of calories in the stool, but had greater rates of heat production and energy expenditure, which was accompanied by an elevated plasma level of thyroxine. Furthermore, rats receiving the experimental diet had a smaller rate of lipid synthesis in their adipose tissue, and a reduced plasma insulin level. The data suggest that inhibition of gain in weight with the addition of pyruvate and dihydroxyacetone to the diet is the result of an increased loss of calories as heat at the expense of storage as lipid. /DHA and pyruvate mixture/",

Fresh DHA solutions were prepared for each application. All mice that died and those killed in moribund condition were examined for tumors and other abnormalities. Tissues examined included skin, liver, spleen, stomach, small and large intestines, kidney, bladder, adrenals, gonads, uterus, pituitary, thyroid, thymus, salivary glands, axillary lymph nodes, lung, and brain. Grossly observable tumors were fixed for microscopic examination. The authors did not provide details regarding the disposition of animals still surviving after the final compound administration at 80 weeks. The authors reported that no significant differences were seen between control mice dosed with distilled water and those treated with DHA. Except for the brown color on the DHA-treated mice, no differences in physical appearance, behavior, weight gains, or survival were observed. The number of tumors identified in male mice were 22, 16, and 16, respectively, in the 0, 5%, and 40% DHA groups. Corresponding figures for the female mice were 26, 27, and 26 tumors in the 0, 5%, and 40% DHA groups, respectively. Microscopic findings were also reported, with no significant differences observed between treated animals and controls. The number of mice examined microscopically were 26 males and 30 females in the control group, 26 males and 26 females in the 5% DHA group, and 18 males and 25 females in the 40% DHA group.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.35X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dihydroxyacetone will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dihydroxyacetone will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Dihydroxyacetone does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dihydroxyacetone is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.5X10-12 atm-cu m/mole. Dihydroxyacetone may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, dihydroxyacetone is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to dihydroxyacetone may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dihydroxyacetone is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dihydroxyacetone via dermal contact with consumer products containing dihydroxyacetone. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

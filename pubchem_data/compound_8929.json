PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Salmonella typhimurium mutant DW379 (OASS deficient) is neither able to carry out this reaction in vitro nor produce the toxic metabolite in vivo. L-Cysteine reverses the cyanide metabolite mediated inhibition and thus allows OASS positive strains to grow in medium containing cyanide and O-acetylserine. The results suggest that the enzyme O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase catalyzes the reaction of cyanide and O-acetylserine to form the toxic metabolite. This metabolite from ninhydrin-positive, adheres strongly to the cation-exchange column, and migrates in thin layer chromatography to an Rf value similar to that of beta-cyanoalanine.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Simultaneous intracellular recordings of presynaptic and postsynaptic resting action potentials were made during bath application of various metabolic inhibitors including sodium cyanide. Cyanide reversibly depressed the post-synaptic potential. The progressive reduction of post-synaptic potential amplitude was accompanied by a reversible increase in synaptic delay. The time course of block of the post-synaptic potential was similar for different agents and dependant on the rate of presynaptic activity (30-40 min at 0.01 Hz). Recovery of the post-synaptic action potential following block by cyanide was obtained within 40 min. Synaptic depression by the metabolic inhibitors does not result from changes in the presynaptic resting or action potentials, nor from a change in post-synaptic receptor sensitivity. The post-synaptic response to local ionophoresis of L-glutamate was unchanged following the inhibition of evoked release of transmitter by cyanide. Injections of EDTA into presynaptic terminals poisoned by cyanide produced transient increases in post-synaptic potential amplitude, suggesting that cyanide is having its effect through raising intracellular calcium rather than lowering ATP. Control experiments injecting EDTA into unpoisoned nerve terminals showed no apparent effect on evoked transmitter release.",

Exposure to sodium cyanide can be rapidly fatal. It has whole-body (systemic) effects, particularly affecting those organ systems most sensitive to low oxygen levels: the central nervous system (brain), the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels), and the pulmonary system (lungs). Sodium cyanide is used commercially for fumigation, electroplating, extracting gold and silver from ores, and chemical manufacturing. Hydrogen cyanide gas released by sodium cyanide has a distinctive bitter almond odor (others describe a musty \u201cold sneakers smell\u201d), but a large proportion of people cannot detect it; the odor does not provide adequate warning of hazardous concentrations. Sodium cyanide is odorless when dry. Sodium cyanide is shipped as pellets or briquettes. It absorbs water from air (is hygroscopic or deliquescent).",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiac abnormalities are common. Cyanosis (blue tint to the skin and mucous membranes) and cherry-red or bloody mucous membranes may occur. Tachypnea (rapid respiratory rate) may be followed by respiratory depression. Pulmonary edema and lung hemorrhage may also occur. Headache, vertigo (dizziness), agitation, and giddiness may be followed by combative behavior, dilated and unreactive pupils, convulsions, paralysis, and coma. Sodium cyanide is irritating to the skin and mucous membranes. Lacrimation (tearing) and a burning sensation of the mouth and throat are common. Increased salivation, nausea, and vomiting are often seen.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested or inhaled the substance; give artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper respiratory medical device. Administer oxygen if breathing is difficult. Remove and isolate contaminated clothing and shoes. In case of contact with substance, immediately flush skin or eyes with running water for at least 20 minutes. For minor skin contact, avoid spreading material on unaffected skin. Keep victim warm and quiet. Effects of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or skin contact) to substance may be delayed.

In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Pesticides for which EPA had not issued Registration Standards prior to the effective date of FIFRA 1988 were divided into three lists based upon their potential for human exposure and other factors, with List B containing pesticides of greater concern and List D pesticides of less concern.

They are also widely used in the synthesis of organic and inorganic chemicals (e.g., nitriles, carboxylic acids, amides, esters, and amines; heavy metal cyanides) and in the production of chelating agents.  HUMAN EXPOSURE: Cyanides are well absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract or skin and rapidly absorbed via the respiratory tract. Once absorbed, cyanide is rapidly and ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, although the highest levels are typically found in the liver, lungs, blood, and brain. There is no accumulation of cyanide in the blood or tissues following chronic or repeated exposure.  Approximately 80% of absorbed cyanide is metabolized to thiocyanate in the liver by the mitochondrial sulfur transferase enzyme rhodanese and other sulfur transferases. Thiocyanate is excreted in the urine. Minor pathways for cyanide detoxification involve reaction with cystine to produce aminothiazoline- and iminothiazolidinecarboxylic acids and combination with hydroxycobalamin (vitamin B12a) to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12); these end-products are also excreted in the urine. The principal features of the toxicity profile for cyanide are its high acute toxicity by all routes of administration, with a very steep and rate-dependent dose-effect curve, and chronic toxicity, probably mediated through the main metabolite and detoxification product, thiocyanate. The toxic effects of cyanide ion in humans and animals are generally similar and are believed to result from inactivation of cytochrome oxidase and inhibition of cellular respiration and consequent histotoxic anoxia. The primary targets of cyanide toxicity in humans are the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The endocrine system is also a potential target for long-term toxicity, as a function of continued exposure to thiocyanate, which prevents the uptake of iodine in the thyroid and acts as a goitrogenic agent.  Sequele after severe acute intoxications may include neuropsychiatric manifestations and Parkinson-type disease. Cyanide from tobacco smoke has been implicated as a contributing factor in tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Long-term exposure to lower concentrations of cyanide in occupational settings can result in a variety of symptoms related to central nervous system effects.  Cyanides are weakly irritating to the skin and eye; alkali salts have not been identified.  ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: The principal features of the toxicity profile for cyanide are its high acute toxicity by all routes of administration, with a very steep and rate-dependent dose-effect curve, and chronic toxicity, probably mediated through the main metabolite and detoxification product, thiocyanate. The toxic effects of cyanide ion in humans and animals are generally similar and are believed to result from inactivation of cytochrome oxidase and inhibition of cellular respiration and consequent histotoxic anoxia. The primary targets of cyanide toxicity in animals are the cardiovascular, respiratory, and central nervous systems. The endocrine system is also a potential target for long-term toxicity, as a function of continued exposure to thiocyanate, which prevents the uptake of iodine in the thyroid and acts as a goitrogenic agent.  In a 13-week repeated-dose toxicity study in which cyanide was administered in drinking-water, there were no clinical signs associated with central nervous system effects or histopathological effects in the brain or thyroid of rats or mice. There were slight changes in the reproductive tract in male rats, which, although they apparently would not affect fertility in rats.  The examination of neurotoxicity in this study was limited to clinical observation and optical microscopy in autopsy. The few available studies specifically intended to investigate neurotoxicity, while reporting adverse effects at exposure levels of 1.2 mg cyanide/kg body weight per day in rats and 0.48 mg cyanide/kg body weight per day in goats, suffer from weaknesses that preclude their quantitative assessment.  In relation to characterization of concentration-response for repeated-dose toxicity for inhalation (relevant principally to the occupational environment), in three separate studies in rats, there were no adverse systemic effects in rats exposed to acetone cyanohydrin, which is rapidly hydrolysed to hydrogen cyanide at physiological pH, at concentrations up to 211 mg/m3 (corresponding to a concentration of 67 mg hydrogen cyanide/m3). The steepness of the dose-effect curve is illustrated by the observation of 30% mortality among rats exposed part of the day to 225 mg acetone cyanohydrin/m3 (71 mg hydrogen cyanide/m3).  Adverse effects of exposure to the low concentrations of cyanide that are generally present in the general environment (<1 ug/m3 in ambient air; <10 ug/litre in water) are unlikely. /Cyanide/",

Consequently the primary mechanism of toxicity for organic nitriles is their production of toxic cyanide ions or hydrogen cyanide. Cyanide is an inhibitor of cytochrome c oxidase in the fourth complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It complexes with the ferric iron atom in this enzyme. The binding of cyanide to this cytochrome prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c oxidase to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted and the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that mainly depend on aerobic respiration, such as the central nervous system and the heart, are particularly affected. Cyanide is also known produce some of its toxic effects by binding to catalase, glutathione peroxidase, methemoglobin, hydroxocobalamin, phosphatase, tyrosinase, ascorbic acid oxidase, xanthine oxidase, succinic dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase. Cyanide binds to the ferric ion of methemoglobin to form inactive cyanmethemoglobin. (L97)",

The mechanism of potentiation of sodium thiosulfate by chlorpromazine was studied alone and in combination with sodium nitrite. Although chlorpromazine was found to induce a hypothermic response, the mechanism of enhancement of the antagonism of cyanide by chlorpromazine does not correlate with the hypothermia produced. Various other possible mechanisms were investigated, such as rate of methemoglobin formation, enzymatic activity of rhodanese and cytochrome oxidase, and alpha-adrenergic blockade. The alpha-adrenergic blocking properties of chlorpromazine may provide a basis for its antidotal effect, since this protective effect can be reversed with an alpha-antagonist, methoxamine. /Cyanide/",

Tributyltin has a sharp cut take off concentration for induction of hemolysis. A 5 uM concentration of tributyltin induces hemolysis and 1 uM or less does not in erythrocyte suspensions with lysis are sigmoidal indicating a complex molecular mechanism leading to lysis. Ten mM sodium cyanide plus 1 uM tributyltin does not stimulate hemolysis rates above levels observed with 10 mM sodium cyanide alone. Five nM sodium cyanide plus hemolytic concentrations of tributyltin stimulates hemolysis rates synergistically compared with either cyanide or tributyltin alone. Ultrastructurally, hemolytic concentrations of tribuyltin can be visualized in the electron microscope by osmium staining during fixation as electron dense spheres penetrating the lipid bilayer of the erythrocyte plasma membrane. Ten mM sodium cyanide plus 25 uM tributyltin increases slightly the size of osmiophilic structures in erythrocyte membranes compared with those spheres seen in cells exposed to 25 uM tribuyltin alone. Sodium cyanide is the only compound tested that stimulates tributyltin induced hemolysis.",

The antidote, which has been used in France since 1970, has proved to be nontoxic and therefore can be given in cases where the diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is not absolutely certain. On the other hand, the Lilly Cyanide Antidote Kit, which has been approved for use in the USA for the same purpose, has been shown to be toxic and its use requires caution. The antidotal effectiveness of the association of hydroxoycobalamin and sodium thiosulfate has been demonstrated in mice and other animal species poisoned with cyanide. Most animal studies reveal a strong antidotal synergism between the two agents. In France, the efficacy of the antidotal combination has been proved in patients who have ingested as much as 1.5 g of potassium cyanide and have blood cyanide levels on the order of 15 ug/ml. In the USA, the antidotal combination is designated as an orphan drug by the FDA and studies have been started to validate its safety and efficacy before being approved for use in this country. /Cyanide/",

Anxiety, confusion, vertigo, giddiness, and often a sensation of stiffness in the lower jaw. 4. Hyperpnea and dyspnea. Respirations become very rapid and then slow and irregular. Inspiration is characteristically short while expiration is greatly prolonged. 5. The odor of bitter almonds may be noted on the breath or vomitus ... 6. In the early phases of poisoning, an increase in vasoconstrictor tone causes a rise in blood pressure and reflex slowing of the heart rate. Thereafter, the pulse becomes rapid, weak, and sometimes irregular. ... A bright pink coloration of the skin due to high concentrations of oxyhemoglobin in the venous return may be confused with that of carbon monoxide poisoning. /Cyanide/",

The mouth is covered with foam, which is sometimes bloodstained. ... The skin color may be brick red. Cyanosis is not prominent in spite of weak and irregular gasping. In the unconscious patient, bradycardia and the absence of cyanosis may be key diagnostic signs. 9. Death from respiratory arrest. /Cyanide/",

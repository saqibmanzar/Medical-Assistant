Between November 11, 1977, and February 28, 1983, 1166 patients with resected Dukes' stage B and C adenocarcinoma of the colon were stratified by Dukes' stage, sex, and age (<65 years or > or =65 years) and then randomly assigned to receive no further treatment (surgery alone; 394 patients), adjuvant chemotherapy (379 patients), or adjuvant immunotherapy (393 patients). Those eligible for follow-up included 375 (95.2%) patients in the surgery-alone group, 349 (92.1%) patients in the adjuvant-chemotherapy group, and 372 (94.7%) patients in the adjuvant-immunotherapy group. All statistical tests were two-sided. No difference was observed between patients in the chemotherapy group and those in the surgery-alone group in 10-year disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.94 to 1.39; P =.17) or overall survival (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.91 to 1.38; P=.27). Immunotherapy did not appear to prevent tumor relapse after 10 years (for surgery alone versus immunotherapy, relative risk [RR] = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.78 to 1.25; P =.93) but had a beneficial effect on 10-year overall survival (for surgery alone versus immunotherapy, RR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.56; P =.02) that apparently results from a reduction in deaths associated with comorbidities in the immunotherapy group. The disease-free and overall survival benefit associated with chemotherapy in this patient population is of limited duration, disappearing after 10 years.",

Abnormalities of renal function (including three cases of renal failure) were noted in seven of 45 patients (16 percent); all these patients received more than 1,400 mg/sq m. This represents an incidence of 26 percent in patients receiving more than 1,400 mg/sq m of semustine. Two distinct patterns emerged. Abnormal serum creatinine levels developed in two patients while receiving semustine and later progressed to renal failure. Five patients had normal serum creatinine levels throughout their treatment courses but had abnormal creatinine values one month to two years following the completion of drug therapy. Renal failure developed in one of these patients, but the remaining four have had stable renal function for one to two years of additional follow-up. No clinical signs of renal insufficiency were detected in any patients receiving less than 1,400 mg/sq m of semustine. No changes unequivocally attributable to semustine were seen in eight patients at autopsy despite the fact that three had received greater than 1,900 mg/sq m of nitrosourea. This incidence of nephrotoxicity appears to be significantly lower than that previously reported in children.",

The case of methyl-CCNU-induced pulmonary fibrosis reported here occurred at a much lower total dose than the first reported case (604 mg/sq m vs. 2,733 mg/sq m). ...",

MeCCNU also produced a dose-dependent decrease in glutathione (GSH) preferentially in liver, but not in kidney. Pretreatment with piperonyl butoxide (PIP) decreased the renal toxicity and covalent binding of MeCCNU, and ameliorated the MeCCNU-dependent decrease in liver and kidney GSH. Radioactivity detected in the urine from the PIP-pretreated group was markedly lower than that in the MeCCNU-only group. In contrast, PIP pretreatment increased the accumulation of parent MeCCNU into fatty tissue. Pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB) increased the renal toxicity of MeCCNU. Moreover, PB pretreatment resulted in the increased alkylation of both liver and kidney macromolecules and to an increase in the urinary clearance of ethylene-labeled MeCCNU. In all experiments, modifiers of hepatic biotransformation produced changes in the level of covalent binding by ethylene-labeled MeCCNU (alkylation) which correlated with the degree of toxicity of MeCCNU in the kidney. Additional evidence supporting a role for hepatic biotransformation in the toxicity of MeCCNU was provided by an in vivo/in vitro colony-forming assay which demonstrated the presence of a cytotoxic metabolite in the bile of a MeCCNU-administered rat. These studies suggest that hepatic metabolism contributes significantly to the alkylating activity of MeCCNU in the liver and the kidney, and indicate that a liver-derived metabolite may be responsible for the renal toxicity of MeCCNU.",

These effects were temporary, spermatogenesis and testiculer weight recovered 50 days after treatment. Mating of the treated males with normal females demonstrated absolute sterility at 20 days and full recovery at 50 days after treatment. Administration of a single lethal dose (38 mg/kg, LD70) of methyl-CCNU to immature (25 day-old) male mice also caused severe but temporary inhibition of spermatogenesis, and mating of mice which survived the treatment and reached sexual maturity, with normal females, resulted in 80 to 100% pregnancies at 40 and 70 days after treatment, respectively. Three repeated injections of 30 mg/kg (at 10 day intervals) of methyl-CCNU to 15 day-old male mice resulted in inhibition of spermatogenesis without alteration in plasma testosterone. Ninety days after this treatment, only 40% of matings with normal females resulted in pregnancies. Female mice treated once with 20 mg/kg of methyl-CCNU, 3 days before or 7 days after mating with normal males, showed complete failure to complete pregnancy-resorption of the embryos was demonstrated in those female mice treated 7 days after mating. After a second mating trial with these two treated groups, performed 40 to 55 and 42 days after the first trial, respectively, 80 and 86% of the females delivered offspring. However, average litter size was reduced to 4 in the second group, as compared to 8 in untreated mice. There were no apparent birth defects in the offspring of methyl-CCNU treated male or female mice.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 5.6X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates semustine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase semustine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 16 hours. Particulate-phase semustine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Semustine contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, semustine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 330. However, by analogy to N-nitroso-N-ethylurea which exhibited a hydrolysis half-life of 47 minutes at pH 9, adsorption may be precluded by hydrolysis. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.5X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, semustine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 70 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Semustine is an alkylating agent that may hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to semustine via dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where semustine is produced or used.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Collected volatiles were similar in both sexes and consisted of n-tridecane (67%), (E)-2-decenal (12%), (E)-2-decenyl acetate (12%), (E)-2-hexenal (3%), hexyl acetate (2%), n-dodecane (2%), a tridecene isomer (1%), and n-undecane, n-tetradecane, and n-pentadecane (all <1%). In addition, undisturbed males produced a novel insect compound, (E)-8-heneicosene, whose function is unknown. The MTG secretion emerges as an enlarging droplet, which is held in place by a cuticular projection and a pleural scent area consisting of specialized rough cuticle surrounding the gland opening. Insects can selectively discharge from either the right or left gland or both glands simultaneously, can control the amount of fluid ejected, and can resorb the ejected secretion droplet back into the gland reservoir. In feeding trials, killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), robins (Turdus migratorius), and anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) rejected or demonstrated aversion to feeding on the bugs. Furthermore, bugs that lacked the secretion were more susceptible to predation that bugs with secretion, suggesting that the secretion functions in defense against predators.",

The predators of heteropteran insects change from small insect predators to large avian predators over time. Thus, a chemical that is deterrent to one type of predator at one point in time may not be deterrent to another type of predator at another point in time. Additionally, these predator deterrent compounds may be used for other functions such as alarm signaling to other conspecifics. Defensive secretion compounds from the adult and the nymph giant mesquite bug (Thasus neocalifornicus: Coreidae) were isolated and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR. The predominant compounds isolated from the nymph mesquite bugs during a simulated predator encounter were (E)-2-hexenal and 4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal. In adults, the major compounds released during a simulated predator encounter were hexyl acetate, hexanal, and hexanol. Results from predator bioassays suggest the nymph compounds are more effective at deterring an insect predator than the adult compounds. By using behavioral bioassays, we determined the role of each individual compound in signaling to other mesquite bugs. The presence of the nymph secretion near a usually compact nymph aggregation caused nymph mesquite bugs to disperse but did not affect adults. Conversely, the presence of the adult secretion caused the usually loose adult aggregation to disperse, but it did not affect nymph aggregation. The compounds that elicited nymph behavioral responses were (E)-2-hexenal and 4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal, while those that elicited adult behavioral responses were hexyl acetate and hexanal. The differences between the chemical composition of nymph and adult defensive secretions and alarm behavior are possibly due to differences in predator guilds.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.32 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates n-hexyl acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase n-hexyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.2 days. n-Hexyl acetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, n-hexyl acetate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 62. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. n-Hexyl acetate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Although biodegradation data were not available for n-hexyl acetate, studies on structurally similar compounds have shown that, in general, alkyl acetates are biodegradable. If released into water, n-hexyl acetate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 34 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is expected to occur slowly based upon estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 2 years and 78 days at pH 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to n-hexyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where n-hexyl acetate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-hexyl acetate via ingestion of food sources that contain this compound. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 5.3X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.5 hours and 5.4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 34(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 2.83(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Hydrolysis is expected to occur slowly based upon estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 2 years and 78 days at pH 7 and 8, respectively(8). Although biodegradation data were not available for n-hexyl acetate(SRC, 2011), studies on structurally similar compounds(9-11) have shown that, in general, alkyl acetates are biodegradable(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Methyprylon is dehydrogenated to 5-methyl-pyrithyldione, then partially oxidized to hydroxy derivatives, and finally oxidized to 5-carboxy-pyrithyldione. The hydroxy derivatives are bound approximately 38% to human plasma proteins. Other less important metabolites may arise, but the metabolites are partly conjugated to glucuronide, with approximately 97% of the parent drug being metabolized. Intact methyprylon (3%) and its metabolites (60%) are recovered in the urine, while approximately 20% is found in the feces, demonstrating that enterohepatic circulation of the drug occurs.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

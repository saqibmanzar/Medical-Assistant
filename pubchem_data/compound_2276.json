PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The amatoxins cause a delayed gastroenteritis at least 4-8 hours after ingestion, often followed by liver and kidney failure 24-48 hours after ingestion of the poisonous mushrooms. The diarrhea is typically watery or cholera-like and may be profuse enough to cause dehydration and shock. Of 10,584 mushroom exposures reported by the American Association of Poison Control Centers in 1996, only 54 were due to the potentially fatal amatoxins. The most common illness following mushroom ingestion is a self-limited gastroenteritis after a short latency of less than 2 hours. Some mushrooms contain neurological toxins such as the hallucinogenic psilocybin or the cholinergic muscarine. Mushroom neurotoxins also have a short latency, usually 15-30 minutes.

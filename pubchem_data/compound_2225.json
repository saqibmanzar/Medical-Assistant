The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body.

The typical mechanism of action of aranidipine, as all dihydropyridines, is based on the inhibition of L-type calcium channels, decreasing calcium concentration and inducing smooth muscle relaxation.

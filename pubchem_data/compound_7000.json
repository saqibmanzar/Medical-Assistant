When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It seems, that like other aromatic amines, o-anisidine is oxidized to a N-hydroxy derivative, which interacts with the heme group of hemoglobin resulting in the formation of methemoglobin. As with other aromatic amines, N,O-acetylation may be involved in the metabolic activation of o-anisidine. In bacterial gene mutation assays with Salmonella typhimurium strains containing elevated levels of N- or O-acetyltransferase activity, mutagenic activity of o-anisidine could be detected. In vitro studies have suggested a possible role for peroxidation enzymes like prostaglandin H synthase in the metabolic activation of o-anisidine. Prostaglandin H synthase is broadly distributed in mammalian tissues including the urinary bladder. Using horseradish peroxidase as a model enzyme, the formation of reactive intermediates from o-anisidine, which were covalently bound to nucleic acids and protein, /was described/. The reactive intermediates formed included electrophilic diimine and quinoneimine metabolites. These metabolites were also formed with prostaglandin H synthase. Further, O-demethylation may occur in the metabolism of o-anisidine. In an in vitro study with microsomes from rat liver, the relative O-demethylation rate of o-anisidine as compared to the formation of formaldehyde from N,N-dimethylaniline was 13%.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The mechanism of its carcinogenicity was investigated with 2 independent methods, (32)P-postlabeling and (14)C-labeled o-anisidine, to show that o-anisidine binds covalently to DNA in vitro after its activation by human hepatic microsomes ... The capacity of o-anisidine to form DNA adducts /was also investigated/ in vivo. Rats were treated ip with o-anisidine (0.15 mg/kg daily for 5 days) and DNA from several organs was analyzed by (32)P-postlabeling. Two o-anisidine-DNA adducts, identical to those found in DNA incubated with o-anisidine and human microsomes in vitro, were detected in urinary bladder (4.1 adducts per 10+7 nucleotides), the target organ, and, to a lesser extent, in liver, kidney and spleen. These DNA adducts were identified as deoxyguanosine adducts derived from a metabolite of o-anisidine, N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine. This metabolite was identified in incubations with human microsomes. With 9 human hepatic microsomal preparations, we identified the specific CYP catalyzing the formation of the o-anisidine metabolites by correlation studies and by examining the effects of CYP inhibitors. On the basis of these analyses, oxidation of o-anisidine was attributed mainly to CYP2E1. Using recombinant human CYP (in Supersomes) and purified CYPs, the participation of CYP2E1 in o-anisidine oxidation was confirmed. In Supersomes, CYP1A2 was even more efficient in oxidizing o-anisidine than CYP2E1, followed by CYP2B6, 1A1, 2A6, 2D6 and 3A4. The results ... strongly suggest a carcinogenic potential of this rodent carcinogen for humans.",

The o-anisidine metabolite, o-aminophenol, caused DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II). The DNA damage was inhibited by catalase and bathocuproine, suggesting the involvement of H2O2 and Cu(I). The formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine by o-aminophenol increased in the presence of Cu(II). /The authors/ conclude that Cu(II)-mediated oxidative DNA damage by this o-anisidine metabolite seems to be relevant for the expression of the carcinogenicity of o-anisidine. o-Aminophenol plus Cu(II) caused preferential DNA damage at the 5'-site guanine of GG and GGG sequences. When CuZn-SOD or Mn-SOD was added, the DNA damage was enhanced and its predominant cleavage sites were changed into thymine and cytosine residues ... SOD may increase the frequency of mutations due to DNA damage induced by o-aminophenol and thus increase its carcinogenic potential.",

If material or contaminated runoff enters waterways, notify downstream users of potentially contaminated waters. Notify local health and fire officials and pollution control agencies.

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Squatting, staggering gait, reduced spontaneous activity, dizziness and respiratory depression was noted in the lower dose-groups. In addition, in the higher dose-groups, abdominal position, negative righting reflex, orange urine, pale skin and at doses of more than 2,500 mg/kg bw, in some cases respiratory sounds were reported. Gross necropsy revealed congestion of blood vessels in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, a yellow-red foamy liquid in the intestine, and hemorrhages in stomach, intestine, and urinary bladder. With the exception of one animal dosed with 1,800 mg/kg bw (recovery within 11 days), in all other surviving animals no signs of toxicity were seen 4 days after application. In other studies, which cannot be validated due to insufficient documentation, LD50 values of 2,020 mg/kg bw for rats and 1,410 mg/kg bw for mice and 870 mg/kg bw for rabbits have been reported.

Controls consisted of groups of 55 untreated rats of each sex and 55 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving rats were /sacrificed/ at 103-107 wk, and all surviving mice at 104 or 105 wk. It was concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, o-anisidine hydrochloride was carcinogenic for Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice, inducing transitional cell carcinomas or papillomas of the bladder in both rats and mice and in both sexes of each species, transitional cell carcinomas of the pelvis of the kidney in male rats, and follicular cell tumors of the thyroid in male rats.

A first dose of 1000 mg/kg (1 dose) resulted in unanimous prostration, with rapid breathing and heart rate within 1 hour. At 24 hours, 1 rat had recovered, 2 were moribund with persisting acute symptoms, and 3 rats had died. Urine was brown with no evidence of blood on dipstick. All surviving high-dose rats were necropsied with the lethalities 24 hours after a single dose. In the remaining groups clinical signs included prostration (500 mg/kg), rapid and shallow respiration (500 mg/kg), accelerated heart rate (500 mg/kg), mortality (1/5, 500 mg/kg), dark urine (500, 100 mg/kg), slight anorexic weight loss (500 mg/kg), and depression (100 mg/kg). Clinical chemistries revealed slight elevation of GPT only in the 500 mg/kg group. This group also demonstrated moderate elevation of white blood cell count, anomalies of red cell indices and cellular morphology. Increased corpuscular volume and mean hemoglobin with normal hemoglobin concentration indicated normochromic macrocytosis; the blood smear showed polychromasia, anisocytosis, macrocytosis, and Howell-Jolly bodies. Upon necropsy, relative liver weights were increased slightly in 500 mg/kg rats, while absolute and relative spleen weight elevations were marked in 100 mg/kg rats and moderate in 50 and 10 mg/kg rats. Necropsy also revealed urethral obstruction (1/5, 1000 mg/kg), pale and swollen kidneys (2/5 1000 mg/kg), blood in small intestine with brown urine-filled distended urinary bladders (4/5, 1000 mg/kg; 1/5, 500 mg/kg), enlarged spleen (5/5, 500 mg/kg), and darkened spleen (4/5, 500 mg/kg). A repeat-dose oral LOAEL was 10 mg/kg. Histologic changes in the 500 mg/kg group included splenic congestion (1/5), hypertrophy of hepatic nuclei (1/5), and mild granular hepatic cytoplasm (3/5). The authors concluded that erythrocytes, spleen, and possibly liver appear to be targets of o-anisidine toxicity. In addition, portal of entry effects were observed from local high dose in the gastrointestinal tract.",

Following range-finding toxicity testing, in two independent assays, bacterial cultures in triplicate with and without metabolic activation were exposed to 0 (DMSO solvent control), 0.025, 0.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/plate for 36-72 hours. Relative to historical controls (N), exposures did not increase mean frequency of base-pair or frame-shift histidine revertants (E) in any strain regardless of metabolic activation, except in TA-100. In TA-100 cultures, a slight and equivocal dose-related response (E >/= N +/- 3.5SN, but E < 2N and response slope < 0.010 revertants/nM) with apparent toxicity at 5.0 mg/plate prompted repeat study: Metabolically-activated TA-100 cultures exposed to doses of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/plate again failed to meet protocol requirements establishing significant dose-related mutagenicity response. In conclusion, the authors reported a negative result in the Salmonella/Microsome mutagenicity assay as tested.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 8.0X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates o-anisidine will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase o-anisidine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.1 hours. Aromatic amines such as aniline have weak absorption bands that extend beyond 290 nm; therefore, o-anisidine may be susceptible to direct photolysis, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. If released to soil, o-anisidine is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 46. The pKa of o-anisidine is 4.53, indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.3X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 40-69.1% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks, indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process, provided microorganisms are not killed by high concentrations of the compound. If released into water, o-anisidine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 44 and 320 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to o-anisidine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where o-anisidine is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to o-anisidine via inhalation of cigarette smoke. (SRC)",

The pKa of o-anisidine is 4.53(4), indicating that this compound will exist partially in cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of o-anisidine from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.3X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(6). o-Anisidine is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 8.0X10-2 mm Hg(7). After 2 weeks, a 40-69.1% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(8) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC), provided microorganisms are not killed by high concentrations of the compound(9,10).",

The typical half-life for reaction of aromatic amines with photochemical generated hydroxyl radicals and alkylperoxy radicals is estimated to be on the order of 19-30 hours in natural sunlit water(5). Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(6) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.3X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(7). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(6), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 44 days and 320 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(8), an estimated BCF of 2(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). After 2 weeks, a 40-69.1% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(9) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC), provided microorganisms are not killed by high concentrations of the compound(10,11).",

Vapor-phase o-anisidine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4.1 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Aromatic amines such as aniline have weak absorption bands that extend beyond 290 nm(4); therefore, o-anisidine may be susceptible to direct photolysis, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown(SRC).",

At high concentrations, o-anisidine has been shown to be toxic to microorganisms and biodegrades at a much slower rate(3,4). 20 ug/L o-anisidine, inoculated with a mixed culture of soil microorganisms in an aqueous mineral salts medium, was found to persist >64 days as measured by UV absorbency(5). 2% of the theoretical BOD was achieved for o-anisidine at 20 ppm in sea water from Akashi Beach, Japan.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 4.1 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). o-Anisidine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Aromatic amines such as aniline have weak absorption bands that extend beyond 290 nm(3); therefore, o-anisidine may be susceptible to direct photolysis, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown(SRC). o-Anisidine may react with either photochemically generated oxidants found in natural sunlit water or it may bond strongly with any humic materials found in suspended solids and sediments(4). The typical half-life for reaction of aromatic amines with photochemical generated hydroxyl radicals and alkylperoxy radicals is estimated to be on the order of 19-30 hours in natural sunlit water(5). Therefore, it is expected that o-anisidine will also undergo indirect photolysis in natural water(SRC).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The levels of furocoumarins present in our diets, while normally well below that causing evident acute phototoxicity, do cause pharmacologically relevant drug interactions. Some are particularly active against cytochrome P450s.  For example, in humans, bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin are responsible for the 'grapefruit juice effect', in which these furanocoumarins affect the metabolism of certain drugs.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Phenolic contents, antioxidant activities of samples were carried out by Folin-Ciocalteu, DPPH, TBA methods. Anticholinesterase activity was evaluated by Ellman's method. The highest and lowest total phenolic content were detected in root MeOH extract (88.6 mg GAE/g DW) and aerial part (51.83 mg GAE/g DW), respectively. The highest antioxidant activity among isolated secondary metabolites got coumarins umbelliferone, bergapten and pimpinellin. Pimpinellin (66.55%) and umbelliferone (61.09%) demonstrated strong inhibition towards acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, respectively. Dichloromethane fraction of root demonstrated significant inhibition against AChE (49.66%) and BuChE (92.21%) at 20 ug/mL. Dichloromethane fractions of roots had a notableness antioxidant and anticholinesterase activities. The further studies on roots will be important for development use of this plant for pharmaceutical and food research needs.",

Lam. The conditions of MAE including the extraction solvent, size of sample, solid/liquid ratio, extraction temperature and extraction time were optimized by a mono-factor test. That is, 2.0 g dried powder of T. asiatica (L.) Lam of 0.30-0.15 mm size was extracted with 20 mL (solid/liquid ratio of 1:10, g/mL) methanol under 50 \u00b0C for 1 min. The crude extract was separated and purified by high-speed counter-current chromatography with hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (5:5:5.5:4.5, v/v/v/v) solvent system. 0.85 mg/g of isopimpinellin, 2.55 mg/g of pimpinellin and 0.95 mg/g of phellopterin were obtained from original sample in one-step within 240 min, the purity determined by high performance liquid chromatography was 95.0%, 99.1% and 96.4%, respectively. Their chemical structures were further identified by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that microwave-assisted extraction coupled with high-speed counter-current chromatography was a feasible, economical and efficient technique for rapid extraction, separation and purification of effective compounds from natural products.",

(Moench) and Angelica archangelica (L.) var. archangelica. The Turbo Method Development program was utilised to optimise the mobile phase with two organic solvents (acetonitrile and methanol) and two aqueous solutions (1.0% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium acetate). Optimisation of the solvent gradients for the method was performed with the aid of the DryLab program. Analyses were carried out using a Phenomenex Prodigy RP C18 column. Fifty-two peaks (14 of which were associated with coumarins) were separated in 30 min from extracts of P. palustre, and 48 peaks (15 associated with coumarins) from extracts of A. archangelica. A total of 21 different coumarin-type compounds were identified in the aerial and the underground parts of the title plants. Isopimpinellin and pimpinellin were found for the first time in P. palustre and were identified by comparison of retention times and MS data obtained following the analysis of pure standards. This is the first report of the coumarin composition of the umbels of P. palustre.",

The samples were extracted with ethanol-water (70 + 30, v/v) by ultrasonication and purified by Florisil SPE. The method was validated for linearity, LOD, LOQ, accuracy, precision, and recovery. The standard curves in the corresponding ranges had good linearity. LOD was at the range of 0.19 to 0.85 mg/kg and LOQ 0.64 to 2.82 mg/kg. The values of RSD for accuracy and intraday and interday precision were less than 3%, except for 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin. Recoveries from spiked samples at 30, 20, and 10 mg/kg in Dendrocalamus giganteus Munro were higher than 70%, except for scopoletin, 6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, and coumarin. The method was validated using field-collected samples taken from Beijing and Changning Counties, SiChuan, China. Six coumarins, namely, skimin, scopolin, scopoletin, umbelliferone, coumarin, and pimpinellin, were found in the extracts of 11 species of bamboo leaves. The concentrations of total coumarins were in the range of 8.67 to 99.2 mg/kg. The maximum concentration of total coumarins was found in Bambusa pervariabilis, and the minimum was in.",

Seventeen constituents were simultaneously determined and quantified by reference standards in 9 min, namely scopoletin, protopine, alpha-allocryptopine, tetrahydropalmatine, coptisine, tetrahydroberberine, corydaline, berberine, byakangelicin, byakangelicol, xanthotoxin, bergapten, pimpinellin, oxypeucedanin, imperatorin, osthole and isoimperatorin. All of them were performed on an Agilent XDB C(18) column (4.6 mm x 50 mm, 1.8 um) with linear gradient elution of acetonitrile-0.3% formic acid water (pH 2.7). The proposed method was applied to analyze 15 batches of samples with acceptable linearity (r(2), 0.9938-0.9999), precisions (RSD, 1.01-4.92%), repeatability (RSD, 1.33-4.91%), stability (RSD, 1.46-4.86%), recovery (RSD, 1.11-4.81%) of the seventeen compounds. Furthermore, the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was applied to classify 15 samples based on characteristics of the 17 compound markers. As a result, the analytical method possessing high sensitivity and speed is suitable for the quality control of YZT.",

Phenacetin was used as the internal standard (IS). Plasma samples were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with methyl tert-butyl ether. The chromatographic separation was carried out on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of methanol-5 mmol/L ammonium acetate (65:35, v/v). The detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) via electrospray ionization (ESI) source with positive ionization mode. The method was linear for all analytes over investigated range with all correlation coefficients greater than 0.9942. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) were 25.0 ng/mL for pimpinellin, 10.0 ng/mL for isopimpinellin and 5.00 ng/mL for phellopterin. The intra- and inter-day precision (RSD%) was within 12% and the accuracy (RE%) ranged from -2.3% to 5.5%. The rapid and sensitive method was fully validated and successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of pimpinellin, isopimpinellin and phellopterin in rats following oral administration of Toddalia asiatica extract.",

There is some evidence from mouse studies that other furocoumarins are carcinogenic when combined with exposure to UVA radiation (A15105). The SKLM regards the additional risk of skin cancer arising from the consumption of typical quantities of furocoumarin-containing foods, which remain significantly below the range of phototoxic doses, as insignificant. However, the consumption of phototoxic quantities cannot be ruled out for certain foods, particularly celery and parsnips, that may lead to significant increases in furocoumarin concentrations, depending on the storage, processing and production conditions. (L2157) Furocoumarin photochemotherapy is known to induce a number of side-effects including erythema, edema, hyperpigmentation, and premature aging of skin. All photobiological effects of furocoumarins result from their photochemical reactions.  Because many dietary or water soluble furocoumarins are strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450s, they will also cause adverse drug reactions when taken with other drugs.

Photoepicutaneous testing showed the strongest phototoxic effects from bergapten, marked effects from pimpinellin, weak effects from sphondin and none from the others. These in vivo findings were confirmed by the in vitro Candida test. Action spectrum studies demonstrated peak photosensitivity in the range 330-335 nm, bergapten being more than twice as phototoxic as pimpinellin.",

Smith is an important Chinese herbal medicine because of its biological functions. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the phytochemicals from Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith and their bioactivity are limited. RESULTS: Using the bioassay-guided technique, the ethyl acetate and n-BuOH extracts of the rhizomes of Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith were shown to exhibit good antitumor activities, consequently leading to the isolation of 23 compounds. All compounds were isolated from the plant for the first time. The inhibitory activities of these compounds were investigated on tumor cells MGC-803, PC3, and A375 in vitro by MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the results showed that pimpinellin (3) had potent cytotoxic activities against the three cell lines, with the IC50 values of 14.4 +/- 0.3 uM, 20.4 +/- 0.5 uM, and 29.2 +/- 0.6 uM, respectively. The mechanism of the antitumor action indicated that pimpinellin inhibited the growth of MGC-803 cells via the induction of tumor cell apoptosis, with apoptosis ratio of 27.44% after 72 hr of treatment at 20 uM. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that most of the compounds from the roots of Cyrtomium fortumei (J.) Smith could inhibit the growth of human carcinoma cells. Moreover, pimpinellin inhibited the growth of tumor cells via the induction of tumor cell apoptosis.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pimpinellin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pimpinellin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 2 and 13 hours, respectively. Particulate-phase pimpinellin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Pimpinellin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pimpinellin is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 320. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Pimpinellin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, pimpinellin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 6 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The lactone ring in analogous isopsoralen is susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis; therefore, pimpinellin may undergo hydrolysis under alkaline environmental conditions. Occupational exposure may be limited to dermal exposure where plants that contain pimpinellin are harvested or processed. The general public is not likely to be exposed to pimpinellin unless by dietary supplement or direct medical treatment. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.4X10-9 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(2). Pimpinellin is expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the presence of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). According to a classification scheme(4), an estimated BCF of 6(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.70(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low.

Vapor-phase pimpinellin is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of pimpinellin with ozone has been estimated as 2.1X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 13 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(3). Particulate-phase pimpinellin may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Pimpinellin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

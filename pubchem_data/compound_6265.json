For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

If irritant or paresthetic effects occur, obtain treatment by a physician. Because volatilization of pyrethroids apparently accounts for paresthesia affecting the face, strenuous measures should be taken (ventilation, protective face mask and hood) to avoid vapor contact with the face and eyes. Vitamin E oil preparations (dL-alpha tocopheryl acetate) are uniquely effective in preventing and stopping the paresthetic reaction. They are safe for application to the skin under field conditions. Corn oil is somewhat effective, but possible side effects with continuing use make it less suitable. Vaseline is less effective than corn oil. Zinc oxide actually worsens the reaction. /Pyrethroids/",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.7X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethrin will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. Particulate-phase dimethrin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. If released to soil, dimethrin is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 31,000. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Although biodegradation data for dimethrin are not available, the pyrethroid class of insecticides is readily degraded by environmental microorganisms and based upon its structure, dimethrin is also expected to readily biodegrade. If released into water, dimethrin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hours and 13 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 520 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Estimated abiotic hydrolysis half-lives are 5 years and 200 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to dimethrin may have occured through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethrin was produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.6X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 15 hours and 13 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 160 years if adsorption is considered(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 520(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 6.57(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(9). Although biodegradation data for dimethrin are not available, the pyrethroid class of insecticides is readily degraded by environmental microorganisms(10,11) and based upon its structure, dimethrin is also expected to readily biodegrade(10,11).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

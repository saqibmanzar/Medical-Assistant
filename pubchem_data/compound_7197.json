When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Clearance of dihydrosafrole and its metabolites from both the ethmoid (olfactory) and maxillary (respiratory) turbinate regions of Beagle dogs and Cynomolgus monkeys was examined. Nasopharyngeal mucus was collected at frequent intervals during periodic instillation of dihydrosafrole (and, for the dogs, 24 hr after instillation). Blood, urine and feces were collected to examine dihydrosafrole clearance from the nose during instillations and up to 48 hr after completion of the nasal instillations of (3)H-dihydrosasfrole. ... Most of the recovered radioactivity was in urine and blood samples over the first 24 hr. Radioactivity was recovered from the nasopharyngeal mucus in both organic extractable and water soluble forms. ... (3)H-dihydrosafrole instilled in either turbinate region was metabolized to 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol, 2-methoxy-4-propenylphenol and 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propan-1-ol. A number of minor metabolites were produced in both species. One mucus sample from an ethmoid-instilled dog contained 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propene (isosafrole) as a metabolite. ... interspecies, inter-individual and inter-regional differences occur in the metabolism of nasally deposited dihydrosafrole in monkeys and dogs.",

Internal standard, S, DHS, and CMDHS are eluted together and injected into a reversed-phase chromatography column. The concentrations of the three products are calculated from calibration graphs, and linearity and reproducibility are verified. The limit of detection is 2 mg/kg. This analytical method allows for control of the synthesis process of piperonyl butoxide and determination of some carcinogenic substances, such as S and DHS.",

The FDA does not permit dihydrosafrole to be used in foods. HUMAN STUDIES: Tested at 12% in petrolatum, it produced no irritation after a 48 hr closed-patch test in 25 human subjects. It was not sensitizing in the maximization test in volunteers. ANIMAL STUDIES: Applied full strength on intact or abraded rabbit skin it was mildly irritating. Dihydrosafrole 1000 ppm fed to rats in the diet for 2 yr retarded growth in females and caused macroscopic and microscopic liver changes. Tumors of esophagus (papillomas and epidermoid carcinomas) developed in 75% of rats fed 5000 or 10,000 mg/kg of diet levels and in 20% of rats fed 2500 mg/kg of diet. Hepatomas, pulmonary tumors and lymphomas were observed in dihydrosafrole-treated mice. Hepatoma incidence tended to be higher in males than females with dihydrosafrole. No significant mutagenic activity was noted in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA100 with or without metabolic activation.",

Pretreatment with isosafrole, safrole, dihydrosafrole, and benzodioxole at dosages as low as 10 mg/kg significantly prevented the increase in plasma transaminase levels and histochemical changes associated with CCl4-induced liver necrosis, whereas piperonyl butoxide (PBO), eugenol, isoeugenol, sesamol, and curcumin did not prevent CCl4 hepatotoxicity even at 200 mg/kg. However, isosafrole was only partly hepatoprotective if administered 10 min after the toxicant. Liver microsomes isolated 1 hr after isosafrole but not after PBO administration had a markedly decreased CYP2E1 activity. Isosafrole, safrole, dihydrosafrole, and benzodioxole in vitro also inhibited CYP2E1-dependent metabolism more effectively than eugenol and isoeugenol, whereas PBO did not inhibit CYP2E1 activity. The protective effects of isosafrole, safrole, and benzodioxole were therefore predominantly attributed to their ability to inactivate CYP2E1, the major isozyme involved in CCl4 bioactivation. The marked potentiation of CCl4 hepatotoxicity in CYP2E1-induced mice was also completely prevented by isosafrole but not PBO pretreatment, supporting the hypothesis that CYP2E1 inhibition by isosafrole contributes to its hepatoprotective effect against CCl4. Isosafrole and safrole also prevented bromotrichloromethane (BrCCl3)-induced hepatocyte cytotoxicity, whereas PBO was ineffective.",

Inhibitory activity of dihydrosafrole towards benzo[a]pyrene (BP) hydroxylase activity in hepatic microsomes from beta-naphthoflavone (BNF)-induced rats, and in reconstituted systems containing cytochrome P-450c, increased dramatically on preincubation of the inhibitor with NADPH; no inhibition occurred without preincubation. The level of BP hydroxylase inhibition was associated with the progressive formation of the 456 nm dihydrosafrole metabolite-cytochrome P-450c spectral complex during preincubation. 2. Inhibition of BP hydroxylase by dihydrosafrole in control microsomes, and inhibition of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) in microsomes (control or BNF-induced) and in reconstituted systems with cytochrome P-450c, did not require preincubation and apparently was not dependent on prior formation of the dihydrosafrole metabolite-cytochrome P-450 complex. 3. Kinetic studies established that, following preincubation with NADPH, dihydrosafrole was a noncompetitive inhibitor of both BP hydroxylase and EROD activities. In the absence of preincubation, dihydrosafrole was an effective competitive inhibitor of EROD in BNF-induced microsomes and in reconstituted systems with cytochrome P-450c. 4. Both ethoxyresorufin and benzo[a]pyrene inhibited the development of the type I optical difference spectrum of dihydrosafrole in reconstituted systems containing cytochrome P-450c. Inhibition by ethoxyresorufin was competitive while that caused by benzo[a]pyrene was noncompetitive in nature. 5. The type II ligand phenylimidazole was an effective noncompetitive inhibitor of EROD activity but failed to exert any inhibitory effect on cytochrome P-450c-mediated BP hydroxylase activity. Phenylimidazole inhibited formation of the dihydrosafrole type I optical difference spectrum non-competitively. 6. The results indicate that ethoxyresorufin and benzo[a]pyrene may occupy different binding sites on cytochrome P-450c and that dihydrosafrole binds primarily to the site utilized by ethoxyresorufin.",

Treatment time for the test animals ranged from 19 to 46 days, while the controls were treated for 106 days. There were no deaths with the 250 and 500 mg doses of dihydrosafrole and the 250 mg dose of safrole. A few deaths, 2/10, 3/10 and 1/10, respectively, resulted from the administration of 250 mg isosafrole, 750 mg dihydrosafrole and 500 mg safrole. Many deaths, 8/10 and 9/10, respectively, were seen with the 500 mg dose of isosafrole and the 750 mg dose of safrole. Macroscopically, all three compounds induced liver enlargement and adrenal enlargement with yellow discoloration, most marked with safrole and dihydrosafrole. Microscopically, there was variation in hepatic cell size, focal fatty metamorphosis, bile-duct proliferation and architectural irregularity.",

The use of dihydrosafrole as an additive in foods is not permitted in the US. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.055 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dihydrosafrole will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dihydrosafrole will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hours. Dihydrosafrole absorbs UV light at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dihydrosafrole is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 300. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.17 atm-cu m/mole. Dihydrosafrole has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.055 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, dihydrosafrole may volatilize from dry soil. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, dihydrosafrole is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 110 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dihydrosafrole may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dihydrosafrole is used. The general population is not likely to be exposed to dihydrosafrole. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase dihydrosafrole is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8 hrs(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

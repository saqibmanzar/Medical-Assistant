Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Catabolism of pivalate released by activation of a prodrug is limited in mammalian tissues. Pivalate can be activated to a coenzyme A thioester in cells. In humans, formation and urinary excretion of pivaloylcarnitine generated from pivaloyl-CoA is the major route of pivalate elimination. Because the total body carnitine pool is limited and can only slowly be replenished through normal diet or biosynthesis, treatment with large doses of pivalate prodrugs may deplete tissue carnitine content. Animal models and long-term treatment of patients with pivalate prodrugs have resulted in toxicity consistent with carnitine depletion. However, low plasma carnitine concentrations after pivalate prodrug exposure may not reflect tissue carnitine content and, thus, cannot be used as a surrogate for potential toxicity. The extent of tissue carnitine depletion will be dependent on the dose of pivalate, because carnitine losses may approximate the pivalate exposure on a stoichiometric basis. These concepts, combined with estimates of carnitine dietary intake and biosynthetic rates, can be used to estimate the impact of pivalate exposure on carnitine homeostasis. Thus, even in populations with altered carnitine homeostasis due to underlying conditions, the use of pivalate prodrugs for short periods of time is unlikely to result in clinically significant carnitine depletion. In contrast, long-term treatment with substantial doses of pivalate prodrugs may require administration of carnitine supplementation to avoid carnitine depletion.",

The free carnitine concentrations in plasma were greatly reduced to approximately 65% of pretreatment levels, and the plasma pivaloylcarnitine (the main metabolite of pivaloyloxymethyl ester) concentrations were increased during the 200-mg (three times a day) regimens but returned to the pretreatment levels within 3 to 5 days after the cessation of treatment. In three elderly patients with declining renal function (creatinine clearance rate, 31 to 50 ml/min), the acylcarnitine/free carnitine ratio increased from 0.1 to 0.4 up to 0.7 to 1.5 at day 5 during the 7-day treatment, showed a tendency to decrease, and then returned to the pretreatment ratio 4 days after discontinuation of the drug. The degree of free carnitine reduction and increase of the acylcarnitine/free carnitine ratio depended mostly on the dose and the duration of S-1108 treatment. The increased acylcarnitine/free carnitine ratio in elderly patients was due to reduction of the free carnitine concentration in plasma and mainly to the retardation of nontoxic pivaloylcarnitine excretion. This study indicated that there was a decrease in free carnitine levels in plasma, but there were no clinical symptoms or adverse effects associated with carnitine reduction in patients during the 7-day multiple administration of S-1108.",

In the present study, the formation of pivaloylcarnitine, expressed as short-chain acylcarnitines has been observed in rats. The carnitine pool of the rats was radiolabeled by injection of L-[3H]butyrobetaine 24 h prior to exposure to pivalic acid injected i.p. or pivampicillin administered orally. The presence of pivaloylcarnitine in liver, heart, kidney, stomach, small intestine, testis, muscle, brown fat, white fat and serum was determined at zero time, 0.5, 2, 8 and 24 h after exposure to pivalic acid. After injection of pivalic acid, pivaloylcarnitine calculated as percent of free carnitine and short-chain acylcarnitines amounted to (mean +/- SD) 1.1 +/- 0, 15.4 +/- 2.5, 33.4 +/- 0.7 and 37.5 +/- 1.5% in the heart and 1.2 +/- 0.2, 20.6 +/- 9.5, 29.8 +/- 7.6 and 22.5 +/- 1.6% in brown fat after 0, 0.5, 2 and 8 h, respectively. 2 h after administration, pivaloylcarnitine calculated as percent of free carnitine and short-chain acylcarnitines was highest in the heart (20.9 +/- 7.6%) and brown fat (19.0 +/- 8.5%) in the pivalic acid-treated rat, and highest in the kidney (12.4 +/- 3.1%) and brown fat (10.2 +/- 2.8%) in the pivampicillin-treated rat. Pivaloylcarnitine percent in the liver was 2.8 +/- 0.6 in the pivalic acid-treated rat, 3.5 +/- 1.2 in the pivampicillin-treated rat and 1.3 +/- 0.4 in the control group. Pivaloylcarnitine concentration, nmol/g and nmol/organ, was highest in the heart and brown fat in both treatment groups. The present study suggests that the heart and the brown fat, but not the liver, play important roles in pivaloylcarnitine formation in the rat.",

They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

These changes persisted for more than ten days after cessation of therapy. In seven girls on long-term treatment with a mixture of pivampicillin and pivmecillinam the mean total serum carnitine concentration fell to 15% (7-27%) of pretreatment values. The acylcarnitine fraction was 11-57% of total carnitine, compared with less than 2% before treatment. Muscle carnitine concentrations in two girls treated with the antibiotics for 22 and 30 months were only 10% of the mean reference value. These concentrations in serum and muscle are in the range encountered in patients with carnitine deficiencies of other aetiologies in which life-threatening metabolic crises may arise. The risk of adverse effects from prodrugs that give rise to pivalic acid should be seriously considered, particularly in patients under metabolic stress.",

Animals were caged in wire mesh compartments within the exposure chamber. Animals were observed for mortality and toxic effects at 30-minute intervals during exposure and daily thereafter. The animals were observed for two weeks following exposure, at which point animals were sacrificed and necropsied. Any animals that died during the exposure or observation periods were necropsied. No deaths occurred among any of the animals during the inhalation exposure. Hyperactivity followed by prostration was observed in mice. All 10 mice died within the 24 hours following exposure. Two rats died on the second and fifth days. Rats displayed piloerection, epitasis, and dyspnea following exposure. Due to advanced autolysis, necropsy of the animals that died did not reveal any meaningful findings. Necropsy of the animals that survived until termination of the study did not reveal any significant gross pathology."

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.50 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 27 days. If released to soil, 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 150. The pKa of 5.03 indicates that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. Several screening biodegradation studies are available that suggest biodegradation occurs only in acclimated systems. If released into water, 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant of 2.78X10-6 atm-cu m/mol. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 and 100 days, respectively. BCF values of <2.3 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Aquatic oxidation with hydroxyl radicals is not likely to be an important fate process based on a half-life of 1.5 yrs in water under continuous sunlight. Occupational exposure to 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid via ingestion of medications, and dermal contact with consumer products containing 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid.

The pKa of 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid is 5.03(4), indicating that this compound will exist partially in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of 2,2-dimethylpropanoic acid from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process because anions do not volatilize. 2,2-Dimethylpropanoic acid is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.50 mm Hg(6).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.78X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 13 and 100 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), BCFs of  <0.2-1.2 at a concentration of 1 ppb and <2.3 at a concentration of 0.1 ppb(6), suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.36 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride will be degraded slowly in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 200 days. If released to soil, 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4,800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. 3,4-Dichlorobenzotrifluoride may potentially volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. If released into water, 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4.3 hours and 5.8 days, respectively. However, volatilization is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A mean BCF of 1,500 in rainbow trout suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Biodegradation is expected to be slow because of the high number of halogens. Occupational exposure to 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride is produced or used. (SRC)",

The potential for volatilization of 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 2.36 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC).

Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake(3) are 4.3 hours and 5.8 days(SRC), respectively. The volatilization half-life from a model pond 2 m deep is estimated to be about 2.1 days ignoring adsorption(5); when considering maximum adsorption the volatilization half-life increases to 53 days(5). According to a classification scheme(6), a mean BCF of 1,500 in rainbow trout(7) suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC). No biodegradation data for 3,4-dichlorobenzotrifluoride were found(SRC); biodegradation is expected to be slow(SRC) as reported for other compounds containing a large number of halogens(8).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

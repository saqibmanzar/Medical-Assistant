Groups of 50 rats of each sex were administered azobenzene at one of two doses, either 200 or 400 ppm, for 105 or 106 weeks. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated rats of each sex. All surviving rats were killed at the end of administration of the test chemical. Groups of 50 male mice were administered azobenzene at one of two doses, either 200 or 400 ppm, for 105 weeks. Groups of 50 female mice were administered the test chemical at one of two doses, initially 400 or 800 ppm, for 38 weeks. Because of excessively lowered body weights in the dosed groups of the females, doses for the females were then reduced to 100 and 400 ppm, respectively, and administration at the lowered doses was continued for 67 or 68 weeks. The time-weighted average doses for the female mice were either 208 or 545 ppm. Matched controls consisted of 20 untreated mice of each sex. All surviving mice were killed at the end of administration of the test chemical.  Mean body weights of dosed rats and mice of each sex were lower than those of corresponding controls, and were generally dose related throughout the bioassay. Mortality was dose related in the male rats and the female mice, but was not significantly affected in either the female rats or the male mice. Survival was 70% or greater at week 90 on study in all dosed and control groups of each species and sex; thus, sufficient numbers of animals were at risk in all groups for the development of late-appearing tumors. In rats, a large number of sarcomas, including fibrosarcomas, hemangiosarcomas, and osteosarcomas in both males and females and malignant hemangiopericytomas in females, occurred in the spleen and other abdominal organs at incidences that were dose related in each sex (P<0.001) and that in direct comparisons were significantly higher (P<0.001) in the high-dose groups of each sex than in the corresponding control groups (males: controls, 0/20, low-dose 6/49, high-dose 31/49; females: controls 0/20, low-dose 5/50, high-dose 21/50).  In mice, no tumors occurred in either males or females at incidences that were significantly higher in the dosed groups than in the corresponding control groups.  It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, azobenzene was carcinogenic (sarcomagenic) for F344 rats, inducing various types of sarcomas in the spleen and other abdominal organs of both males and females. The test chemical was not carcinogenic for B6C3F1 mice of either sex.",

This section also includes information on whether there is a potential for the chemical to persist or degrade in the environment either through biodegradation or other processes (such as oxidation or hydrolysis) as well as the concentration or amount of the chemical found in the environment (e.g., in plants, animals as well as in the atmosphere or water).",

Its former use as a greenhouse fumigant and arcaricide resulted in its direct release to the environment. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.61X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates azobenzene will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase azobenzene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 10 days. In methanol, azobenzene will absorb UV light strongly above 290 nm, and therefore will be susceptible to direct photolyis by sunlight. If released to soil, azobenzene is expected to have low to slight mobility based upon experimental Koc values ranging from 1,350-4,510. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Azobenzene was found to be resistant to biodegradation when tested using a Warburg respirometer, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process. If released into water, azobenzene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc range. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 days and 32 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 10 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to azobenzene may have occurred through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where azobenzene was produced or used. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may have been exposed to azobenzene via dermal contact with consumer products containing this compound. Occupational exposure and general population exposure due to its use as an arcaricide and fumigant should be low or non-existent since azobenzene is no longer produced or used in the US. In the past, azobenzene was used as a fumigant in greenhouses against insects and mites and their eggs. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 3.61X10-4 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 6.40 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.5 days and 32 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 12 to 22 months if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 10(SRC), from its log Kow of 3.82(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Azobenzene was found to be resistant to biodegradation when tested using a Warburg respirometer(10), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 10 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Azobenzene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Azobenzene, in methanol solution, absorbs UV light strongly in the environmental spectrum above 290 nm(3) which indicates a potential for direct photolysis in sunlight(SRC). Laboratory irradiation (via mercury vapor lamps) of azobenzene in cyclohexane solutions in pyrex flasks (which filters UV light below 290 nm) resulted in azobenzene photodecomposition(4); about 100 hr of irradiation were required for 0.001M solutions to achieve complete decomposition(4); initial photodecomposition products were identified as phenylazo, phenylazomethylene and aniline radicals(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that azobenzene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 2.5 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 32 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 22 months to 370 days if adsorption is considered(4). Azobenzene's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Azobenzene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 3.61X10-4 mm Hg(1).",

The samples were filtered on an SPE-filtration device and analyzed using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry(1). The U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) study detected azobenzene, along with other semi-volatile organic chemicals, at 0.4% of 492 sites and detected at a maximum concn of 130 ug/kg dry weight in streambed sediments. The survey conducted testing from across 536 streambed sites in 20 major river basin systems across the U.S. during 1992-1995(2).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The genes from M. methylotropha strain TR3 encoding methanesulfonate monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for the initial oxidation of MSA to formaldehyde and sulfite, were cloned and sequenced. They were located on two gene clusters on the chromosome of this bacterium. A 5.0-kbp HindIII fragment contained msmA, msmB, and msmC, encoding the large and small subunits of the hydroxylase component and the ferredoxin component, respectively, of the methanesulfonate monooxygenase, while a 6.5-kbp HindIII fragment contained duplicate copies of msmA and msmB, as well as msmD, encoding the reductase component of methanesulfonate. Both sets of msmA and msmB genes were virtually identical, and the derived msmA and msmB sequences of M. methylotropha strain TR3, compared with the corresponding hydroxylase from the terrestrial MSA utilizer Methylosulfonomonas methylovora strain M2 were found to be 82 and 69% identical. The msmA gene was investigated as a functional gene probe for detection of MSA-utilizing bacteria. PCR primers spanning a region of msmA which encoded a unique Rieske [2Fe-2S] binding region were designed. These primers were used to amplify the corresponding msmA genes from newly isolated Hyphomicrobium, Methylobacterium, and Pedomicrobium species that utilized MSA, from MSA enrichment cultures, and from DNA samples extracted directly from the environment. The high degree of identity of these msmA gene fragments, compared to msmA sequences from extant MSA utilizers, indicated the effectiveness of these PCR primers in molecular microbial ecology.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Their effects can be ascribed to an ability to modify DNA covalently. Pioneering studies of the chemical reactivity of methylating agents towards DNA components and their effectiveness as animal carcinogens identified O(6)-methylguanine (O(6)meG) as a potentially important DNA lesion. Subsequent analysis of the effects of methylating carcinogens in bacteria and cultured mammalian cells - including the discovery of the inducible adaptive response to alkylating agents in Escherichia coli - have defined the contributions of O(6)meG and other methylated DNA bases to the biological effects of these chemicals. More recently, the role of O(6)meG in killing mammalian cells has been revealed by the lethal interaction between persistent DNA O(6)meG and the mismatch repair pathway. Here, ...the results which led to the identification of the biological consequences of persistent DNA O(6)meG are reviewed. ... The possible consequences for a human cell of chronic exposure to low levels of a methylating agent /are considered/. Such exposure may increase the probability that the cell's mismatch repair pathway becomes inactive. Loss of mismatch repair predisposes the cell to mutation induction, not only through uncorrected replication errors but also by methylating agents and other mutagens. /Alkylating agents/",

The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

Methanesulfonic acid is produced by atmospheric hydrolysis of dimethyl sulfoxide, which itself is produced from naturally-derived dimethyl sulfide. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.28X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methanesulfonic acid will exist solely as a vapor. Vapor-phase methanesulfonic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 58 days. Methanesulfonic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, methanesulfonic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. The pKa of methanesulfonic acid is -1.86, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil is not expected because the acid exists as an anion and anions do not volatilize. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 100% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in four weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, methanesulfonic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa indicates methanesulfonic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. Methanesulfonic acid is miscible with water and therefore bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to methanesulfonic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methanesulfonic acid is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to methansulfonic acid via inhalation of ambient air; methanesulfonic acid is widely detected in marine air. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

It functions by preventing the synthesis of ergosterol, the fungal equivalent of cholesterol, thereby increasing membrane fluidity and preventing growth of the fungus. Ketoconazole was first approved in an oral formulation for systemic use by the FDA in 1981. At this time it was considered a significant improvement over previous antifungals, [miconazole] and [clotrimazole], due to its broad spectrum and good absorption. However, it was discovered that ketoconazole produces frequent gastrointestinal side effects and dose-related hepatitis. These effects combined with waning efficacy led to its eventual replacement by triazole agents, [fluconazole], [itraconazole], [voriconazole], and [posaconazole]. Ketoconazole and its predecessor [clotrimazole] continue to be used in topical formulations.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Serious hepatotoxicity has occurred in patients receiving oral ketoconazole, including cases that were fatal or required liver transplantation. Hepatotoxicity may be hepatocellular (in most cases), cholestatic, or a mixed pattern of injury. Although ketoconazole-induced hepatotoxicity usually is reversible following discontinuance of the drug, recovery may take several months and rarely death has occurred. Symptomatic hepatotoxicity usually is apparent within the first few months of ketoconazole therapy, but occasionally may be apparent within the first week of therapy. Some patients with ketoconazole-induced hepatotoxicity had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving high oral ketoconazole dosage for short treatment durations and in patients receiving low oral dosage of the drug for long durations. Many of the reported cases of hepatotoxicity occurred in patients who received the drug for the treatment of tinea unguium (onychomycosi or the treatment of chronic, refractory dermatophytoses. Ketoconazole-induced hepatitis has been reported in some children.",

A single 200 mg oral dose produces a Cmax of 2.5-3 mcg/mL with a Tmax of 1-4 h. Administering ketoconazole with food consistently increases Cmax and delays Tmax but literature is contradictory regarding the effect on AUC, which may experience a small decrease.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

This metabolic inhibition also results in accumulation of 14\u03b1-methyl-3,6-diol, a toxic metabolite.

The fungicidal activity of ketoconazole at high concentrations may result from a direct physiochemical effect of the drug on the fungal cell membrane.",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Transient increases in serum AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations may occur during ketoconazole therapy. Serious hepatotoxicity has occurred in patients receiving oral ketoconazole, including cases that were fatal or required liver transplantation. Hepatotoxicity may be hepatocellular (in most cases), cholestatic, or a mixed pattern of injury. Although ketoconazole-induced hepatotoxicity usually is reversible following discontinuance of the drug, recovery may take several months and rarely death has occurred. Symptomatic hepatotoxicity usually is apparent within the first few months of ketoconazole therapy, but occasionally may be apparent within the first week of therapy. Some patients with ketoconazole-induced hepatotoxicity had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving high oral ketoconazole dosage for short treatment durations and in patients receiving low oral dosage of the drug for long durations. Many of the reported cases of hepatotoxicity occurred in patients who received the drug for the treatment of tinea unguium (onychomycosi or the treatment of chronic, refractory dermatophytoses. Ketoconazole-induced hepatitis has been reported in some children. Usual dosages (ie, 200-400 mg daily) of ketoconazole have been reported to transiently (for 2-12 hours) inhibit testicular testosterone synthesis. A compensatory increase in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations may occur. Dosages of 800-1200 mg daily have been reported to have a more prolonged effect on testosterone synthesis; in one study in males receiving these high dosages, serum testosterone concentrations remained at a subnormal level (ie, less than 300 ng/dL) throughout the day in about 30% of those receiving 800 mg daily and in all of those receiving 1200 mg daily. Oligospermia, decreased libido, and impotence often occurred in these males and azoospermia occurred rarely. The drug apparently directly inhibits synthesis of adrenal steroids and testosterone in vitro and in vivo. Ketoconazole appears to inhibit steroid synthesis principally by blocking several P-450 enzyme systems (eg, 11beta-hydroxylase, C-17,20-lyase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme). Overall the results show that many of the commonly used azole fungicides act as endocrine disruptors in vivo, although the profile of action in vivo varies. As ketoconazole is known to implicate numerous endocrine-disrupting effects in humans. ANIMAL STUDIES: After oral administration toxicity was manifested in mice, rats and guinea pigs by sedation, catalepsy, ataxia, tremors, convulsions and pre-lethal loss of the righting reflex at doses >320 mg/kg. In dogs, toxicity was manifested by diarrhea and vomiting at doses >80 mg/kg. Ketoconazole has been administered by the oral (gavage) and intravenous routes to mice, rats, guinea pigs and dogs. Toxicity after intravenous administration was manifested by spasms, convulsions and dyspnea in rats, mice and guinea pigs; pre-lethal loss of the righting reflex occurred in mice and guinea pigs, and dogs. Toxicity in dogs was also manifested by licking and convulsions. In rats the overall incidence of and type of tumors was not significantly different between treated and control groups, except for high-dosed female rats who had a decrease of the overall tumor rate. In developmental studies in rats the incidence of stillborn fetuses increased from a control value of 0.5% to 32.7% in rats dosed with 40 mg/kg and cannibalization of young occurred in two litters. In mice a significant decline in sperm motility and density in cauda epididymis was noted. A sharp decline in fertility (50% negative) in ketoconazole treated mice was observed. A significant reduction in the total protein and sialic acid contents of testes, epididymis, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate were noticed. The cholesterol contents of testes were raised while fructose contents of seminal vesicle were reduced significantly. The ketoconazole treatment altered the biochemical milieu of the reproductive tract. In the rabbit, ketoconazole produces evidence of maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity and teratogenicity at a high dose of 40 mg/kg/day. Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Ketoconazole induced CYP1A and CYP3A expression in rainbow trout. However, the most pronounced effect of ketoconazole was a 60 to 90% decrease in CYP3A catalytic activities in rainbow trout and in killifish.",

While most cases present with a hepatocellular pattern of injury, cholestatic forms have been described. Rash, fever and eosinophilia are rare as is autoantibody formation.

Serious hepatotoxicity has occurred in patients receiving oral ketoconazole, including cases that were fatal or required liver transplantation. Hepatotoxicity may be hepatocellular (in most cases), cholestatic, or a mixed pattern of injury. Although ketoconazole-induced hepatotoxicity usually is reversible following discontinuance of the drug, recovery may take several months and rarely death has occurred. Symptomatic hepatotoxicity usually is apparent within the first few months of ketoconazole therapy, but occasionally may be apparent within the first week of therapy. Some patients with ketoconazole-induced hepatotoxicity had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving high oral ketoconazole dosage for short treatment durations and in patients receiving low oral dosage of the drug for long durations. Many of the reported cases of hepatotoxicity occurred in patients who received the drug for the treatment of tinea unguium (onychomycosi or the treatment of chronic, refractory dermatophytoses. Ketoconazole-induced hepatitis has been reported in some children.",

Hematology was normal in all groups. No deleterious effects on serum analyses were seen in males at 10 and 40 mg/kg. At 160 mg/kg potassium and BUN decreased significantly. In female rats dosed at 10 mg/kg no relevant differences in serum analyses were found between control and treated animals. At 40 and 160 mg/kg serum sodium increased significantly, while BUN and potassium decreased. A decrease in chloride and increase in alkaline phosphatase at 160 mg/kg are also considered to be among the drug and dose-related effects. In control, low and medium dosed males and females and in the high-dosed males no abnormalities were seen in urinalyses. At 160 mg/kg, female rats had increased excretion of urine and decreased creatinine. In 3 of 10 females, casts were seen at the high dose. In animals of both sexes dosed with 10 mg/kg and in male rats dosed at 40 mg/kg, ketoconazole had no effect on mortality, behaviour, appearance, food consumption, body weight, gross pathology, organ weight, or histology. Female rats dosed at 40 mg/kg were not significantly different from undosed female rats with respect to mortality, behaviour, appearance, food consumption or body weight. However, at 40 mg/kg discolored livers were seen in 5/10 female rats, pale adrenals in 5/10 and slightly larger ovaries in 8/10. Marginal increases were seen in the absolute and relative weight of the liver and ovaries. Histologically the livers of the female rats dosed at 40 mg/kg appeared normal. In the adrenals the following changes were noted: a glomerulosa zone devoid of fat, and a fatty overload in the fasciculata and reticularis zones. The disturbed aspect of the inner zone was a result of increased RE framework, swelling of pigment-loaded sinusoidal cells and macrophage activity. A clearer aspect of the interstitial tissue of the ovary was also noted at histology. One female dosed at 40 mg/kg exhibited swelling of the convoluted tubule and/or loop of Henle in the kidney. At 160 mg/kg, 2 male rats died whereas all females survived. Behaviour and appearance was normal in males whereas swollen eyelids were seen in all high-dosed females with some exhibiting this as early as after 2 months of dosing. Fragile leg bones were noted in 9/10 female rats with 4/10 having broken legs. Total food consumption decreased significantly in both sexes as did total weight gain and terminal body weight. These phenomena appeared during the first week of dosing. Gross pathology also revealed the following changes: discolored livers 6/10 males, 9/10 females; pale adrenals 1/10 male, 9/10 females; pseudopregnancy 9/10 females. Relative weight increase of liver and adrenals, and increases in the relative and absolute weights of the testes were noted in high-dosed male rats. Female rats exhibited increased absolute and relative weight of liver and adrenals as well as increase in the relative weight of spleen and kidney. Histology indicated the following drug induced changes: slight centrilobular swelling and/or finely granular or blurred aspect of the cytoplasm of the liver with brown hepatocytic pigmentation; swelling of the distal tubules and/or loops of Henle in the kidney; the uterus was small and exhibited an anoestral aspect, the vaginal epithelium was mucified or thin; the ovary was characterized by an increased amount of interstitial glandular tissue with large clear cells, highly vacuolated corpora lutea and conspicuous follicular cysts which were sometimes atretic and leading to interstitial tissue formation; in both sexes the adrenals were characterized by a thin glomerulosa zone devoid of fat, fatty overload in the fasciculata and especially in the reticularis zones with macrophage activity, RE stimulation and eventually infiltration with round cells. The weakness of the bony tissues seen in the high dosed females was manifested on histological examination by diminished diameter of the tibial bone, and irregularities in the mineralization of the compact bone; cancellous bone hyperplasia and spontaneous fractures which were the sites of callus formation with marked fibrosis eventually extending far into the neighboring tissues.",

At necropsy the following dose-related effects were seen: a brownish aspect of the salivary glands and the abdominal fat in medium and high-dosed animals and broken legs in one high-dosed male, 2 medium-dosed females and 10 high-dosed females. These findings have been identified in the 18 month rat toxicity study. The overall incidence of and type of tumors was not significantly different between treated and control groups, except for high-dosed female rats who had a decrease of the overall tumor rate.",

The CYP1A expression (mRNA, protein) and activity was induced in rainbow trout, whereas in killifish no effect of ketoconazole on CYP1A protein expression was observed. A biphasic dose-response relationship was observed between ketoconazole exposure and hepatic CYP1A-mediated ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in rainbow trout in vitro and in vivo, implying that higher doses of ketoconazole inhibit CYP1A activities. Slight induction of CYP3A protein levels was observed in rainbow trout exposed in vivo to ketoconazole. However, the CYP3A-mediated benzyloxy-4-[trifluoromethyl]-coumarin (BFC) O-debenzyloxylase activity was reduced in rainbow trout and killifish treated with ketoconazole. In vitro inhibition studies confirmed that ketoconazole was a potent inhibitor of both CYP3A and CYP1A enzyme activities in these species. This study showed that ketoconazole induced CYP1A and CYP3A expression in rainbow trout. However, the most pronounced effect of ketoconazole was a 60 to 90% decrease in CYP3A catalytic activities in rainbow trout and in killifish.",

Juvenile rainbow trout were i.p. injected with a single low dose of EE(2) (2.5 ug/kg), alone or in combination with ketoconazole (100 mg/kg). Hepatic microsomal CYP1A and CYP3A protein expressions were analyzed in Western blots using polyclonal antibodies (PAb) and enhanced cheminoluminescence. CYP1A activities were analyzed using the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay and CYP3A activities were analyzed using the benzyloxy-4-[trifluoromethyl]-coumarin-O-debenzyloxylase (BFCOD) assay. Plasma vitellogenin (vtg) and sex steroid hormones (i.e. 17beta-estradiol, testosterone and 11-keto-testosterone) were analyzed using commercially available ELISA-kits. The vtg mRNA expression was analyzed using quantitative (Q)-PCR. The dose of EE(2) selected had little or no effect on the estrogen receptor (ER) mediated vtg induction. However, in combination with ketoconazole this threshold-dose of EE(2) resulted in significantly elevated plasma vtg levels, 6 days post injection. Exposure to ketoconazole resulted in up to nine-fold induction of CYP1A after 3 days. However, this nine-fold induction was not reflected on the CYP1A catalytic activity, where exposure to ketoconazole resulted only in a two-fold increase in activity. Ketoconazole increased CYP3A protein levels 1.5-fold and decreased BFCOD activities by 80% at days 3 and 6. Treatment with ketoconazole and EE(2) alone and in combination had no significant effect on sex steroid hormones, compared to vehicle-treated fish. This study demonstrates that exposure to ketoconazole compromises the function of key enzymes involved in metabolic clearance of xenobiotics and steroids, and increases the sensitivity to EE(2) exposure in juvenile rainbow trout.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the interactions of two classes of EDCs, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and ketoconazole (KTC), on endocrine function in male goldfish (Carassius auratus), including vitellogenesis, metabolic capability and serum steroid synthesis. Changes in vitellogenin (VTG) concentration, liver 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and circulating serum E2 level were examined. The expression of related genes was also determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Exposure to E2 caused a significant increase in VTG concentrations which corresponded with the gene expression of VTG and estrogen receptor (ER) in males, which were further elevated after combined exposure to E2 and KTC, indicative of a synergetic relationship. Exposure to E2 also resulted in a distinct increase in serum steroid biosynthesis and associated cytochrome P450 (CYP) aromatase expression after 10 days. However, these changes were inhibited by the presence of KTC, which acted as a steroidogenic inhibitor in fish. Moreover, KTC significantly decreased liver EROD activity and increased the related gene expression of CYP1A. However, these KTC-mediated metabolic reactions in goldfish were up-regulated following exposure to KTC in combination with E2. These findings reveal complex interactions on endocrine functions in male goldfish when exposed to multiple contaminations and may provide a better understanding of the effects of toxic mixtures.",

Several of these fungicides have been shown to be reversible inhibitors of CYPs in vertebrates (primarily mammals), including CYP isoforms involved in the pathway that converts cholesterol to active sex steroids. In these studies, we assessed the effects of KTC on aspects of steroidogenesis and reproductive function in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). Exposure of spawning adults to the fungicide for 21 days significantly decreased egg production at a water concentration as low as 25 ug/L. Despite evidence of reduced ex vivo testosterone production by gonads from KTC-exposed fathead minnows, circulating plasma concentrations of sex steroids (testosterone, 17beta-estradiol) were not affected. Exposure to KTC caused an increase in the gonadosomatic index in both sexes and, in males, the fungicide caused a marked proliferation of interstitial (Leydig) cells. In addition, mRNA transcripts for two key steroidogenic enzymes, cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage (CYP11A) and cytochrome P450 c17a hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (CYP17), were elevated by exposure to KTC. Both the changes in transcript levels and proliferation of gonad tissue represent potential adaptive or compensatory responses to impaired steroidogenic capacity. Overall our data indicate that, although KTC does adversely affect steroidogenesis and reproduction in the fathead minnow, the fish can compensate to some degree to mitigate effects of the fungicide. This has important implications for the interpretation of data from tests with endocrine-active chemicals.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 6.4X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ketoconazole will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase ketoconazole will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Ketoconazole contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ketoconazole is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 3,000. An estimated pKa of 3.96 indicates that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-20 atm-cu m/mole. Ketoconazole is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Ketoconazole was found to be biodegraded under sewage treatment plant conditions, suggesting biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil or water. If released into water, ketoconazole is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 340 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to ketoconazole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ketoconazole is produced or used. Exposure to ketoconazole among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug. (SRC)",

The estimated pKa of 3.96(4) indicates that this compound will exist partially in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of ketoconazole from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.6X10-20 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Ketoconazole is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 6.4X10-14 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).

Distribution, behavior, and fate of frequently used azole antifungal pharmaceuticals were investigated in wastewater at two sewage treatment plants (STPs) in China. Fluconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole were constantly detected at 1-1834 ng/L in the wastewater. The latter four were also ubiquitously detected in sewage sludge. Fluconazole passed through treatment in the STPs and largely remained in the final effluent. On the contrary, biotransformation and sorption to sludge occurred to the other azoles. Ketoconazole was more readily bio-transformed, whereas clotrimazole, econazole, and miconazole were more likely to be adsorbed onto and persisted in sewage sludge. Lipophilicity plays the governing role on adsorption. The highest concentrations in the raw wastewater were observed in winter for the azole pharmaceuticals except for fluconazole. The seasonal difference was smoothed out after treatment in the STPs.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

The activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin on exotoxin release by S. aureus was investigated by 2D SDS-PAGE combined with MALDI-TOF/MS analysis and by western blotting. /The researchers/ show that quinupristin/dalfopristin at subinhibitory concentrations reduces the release of S. aureus factors that induce tumour necrosis factor secretion in macrophages. Furthermore, quinupristin/dalfopristin but not linezolid attenuated S. aureus-mediated killing of infected host cells. When added to S. aureus cultures at different stages of bacterial growth, quinupristin/dalfopristin reduced in a dose-dependent manner the release of specific virulence factors (e.g. autolysin, protein A, alpha- and beta-haemolysins, lipases). In contrast, other presumably non-toxic exoproteins remained unchanged. The results of the present study suggest that subinhibitory quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits virulence factor release by S. aureus, which might be especially helpful for the treatment of S. aureus infections, where both bactericidal as well as anti-toxin activity may be advantageous.",

Liver function tests, including a test for alkaline phosphatase, were performed before, during and after the end of therapy. All patients were followed for 1 month after completion of therapy. Thirty-eight (68%) of the 56 patients responded. Myalgias/arthralgias were the leading adverse events occurring in 20 (36%) of the patients. Patients with myalgias/arthralgias had significantly higher levels of alkaline phosphatase (mean 318.7 IU/L) during the mid-term therapy cycle compared with patients without any joint or muscular pain (mean 216.3 IU/L, P = 0.05). In addition, 3/18 (16.6%) patients with myalgias/arthralgias had more than five-fold the normal levels of alkaline phosphatase, which did not occur in any of the other patients who did not develop myalgias/arthralgias (P = 0.04). All myalgias/arthralgias resolved after the discontinuation of quinupristin/dalfopristin. By univariate analysis, other factors associated with myalgias/arthralgias were relapse of hematological malignancy (P = 0.01), receiving tacrolimus within 1 month prior to treatment (P = 0.04) and receiving methotrexate during antimicrobial therapy (P = 0.05). Myalgias/arthralgias occur frequently in cancer patients receiving quinupristin/dalfopristin and may be associated with biliary tract dysfunction, as measured by alkaline phosphatase or other factors that could lead to intra-hepatic cholestasis, such as relapse of haematological malignancy or treatment with tacrolimus or methotrexate.",

In rats and monkeys quinupristin and dalfopristin undergo rapid elimination from the blood and wide tissue distribution. Nevertheless, they do not penetrate the central nervous system or cross the placenta to any significant degree and they do not appear to be subject to significant body retention following cessation of administration. The blood elimination half-life of quinupristin was approximately 0.6 hr in rats and 0.5 hr in monkeys, and that of dalfopristin was approximately 0.6 hr and 0.2 hr, respectively. Both compounds are primarily eliminated through the bile into the faeces; quinupristin is mainly excreted unchanged whereas dalfopristin is extensively metabolized beforehand. The metabolites include the microbiologically active pristinamycin PIIA for dalfopristin and the microbiologically active glutathione- and cysteine-conjugated derivatives for quinupristin. Quinupristin and dalfopristin appear to be handled in a similar manner by humans. Following intravenous administration both compounds are rapidly cleared from the blood with elimination half-lives of approximately 1 hr for quinupristin and 0.4-0.5 hr for dalfopristin. The pharmacokinetic profile of quinupristin is dose-independent and so is that of dalfopristin and RP 12536 when considered together. Extravascular diffusion of quinupristin/dalfopristin has been assessed in human non-inflammatory interstitial fluid.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Investigation of the structure of the ribosomal subunits in complex with different antibiotics can reveal the mode of inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis. Analysis of the interactions between antibiotics and the ribosome permits investigation of the specific effect of modifications leading to antimicrobial resistances. Streptogramins are unique among the ribosome-targeting antibiotics because they consist of two components, streptogramins A and B, which act synergistically. Each compound alone exhibits a weak bacteriostatic activity, whereas the combination can act bactericidal. The streptogramins A display a prolonged activity that even persists after removal of the drug. However, the mode of activity of the streptogramins has not yet been fully elucidated, despite a plethora of biochemical and structural data.  RESULTS: The investigation of the crystal structure of the 50S ribosomal subunit from Deinococcus radiodurans in complex with the clinically relevant streptogramins quinupristin and dalfopristin reveals their unique inhibitory mechanism. Quinupristin, a streptogramin B compound, binds in the ribosomal exit tunnel in a similar manner and position as the macrolides, suggesting a similar inhibitory mechanism, namely blockage of the ribosomal tunnel. Dalfopristin, the corresponding streptogramin A compound, binds close to quinupristin directly within the peptidyl transferase centre affecting both A- and P-site occupation by tRNA molecules. The crystal structure indicates that the synergistic effect derives from direct interaction between both compounds and shared contacts with a single nucleotide, A2062. Upon binding of the streptogramins, the peptidyl transferase centre undergoes a significant conformational transition, which leads to a stable, non-productive orientation of the universally conserved U2585. Mutations of this rRNA base are known to yield dominant lethal phenotypes. It seems, therefore, plausible to conclude that the conformational change within the peptidyl transferase centre is mainly responsible for the bactericidal activity of the streptogramins and the post-antibiotic inhibition of protein synthesis.",

Baseline trough cyclosporine levels ranged from 80 to 105 ng/ml. Two and 3 days after initiation of quinupristin/dalfopristin therapy, trough cyclosporine levels increased to 261 and 291 ng/ml, respectively.

In this study, cultured murine fibroblasts and immortalised human endothelial cells were exposed to three antibiotics at clinically relevant concentrations to assess their toxic potential in two established cytotoxicity assays. BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts and Eahy926 endothelial cells were exposed to quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD), erythromycin and levofloxacin at increasing concentrations. For assessment of cytotoxicity the cells were incubated with neutral red (NR) or stained with crystal violet (CV). Measurements were done by photometry. At the concentration range tested QD and erythromycin showed a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect in both cell cultures. In 3T3 cells the half-maximal effect concentration (EC50) was 20 mg/l for QD and 340 mg/l for erythromycin in the NR uptake test and 12 and 200 mg/l, respectively, in the CV assay. In Eahy926 cells the EC50 was 50 mg/l for QD and 880 mg/l for erythromycin in the NR uptake test and 40 and 750 mg/l, respectively, in the CV assay. No EC50 could be established in both cell types for levofloxacin. Eahy926 cells were less sensitive to cytotoxic stimuli than 3T3 fibroblasts. Cytotoxic effects in both cell cultures occurred in the following order: QD > erythromycin >> levofloxacin. This ranking correlates well with the frequency of local adverse effects observed with the infusion of these antibiotics in patients. Thus, these in vitro assays may serve as an estimate for the prediction of local tolerability of antibiotics when administered parenterally.",

All adult and pediatric patients who had received quinupristin-dalfopristin through either a compassionate-use protocol (February 1996-October 1999) or in the year after quinupristin-dalfopristin was added to the hospital formulary (November 1999-October 2000) were included in this study. Case patients were those who developed arthralgias or myalgias while receiving quinupristin-dalfopristin therapy; control patients were those who received quinupristin-dalfopristin but did not develop arthralgias or myalgias. Medical records, pharmacy dispensing information, and microbiology data were reviewed by a physician and a pharmacist, both of whom specialized in infectious diseases. Presence or absence of arthralgias or myalgias was the primary outcome assessed. Quinupristin-dalfopristin was administered to 68 patients during the period defined by the study. Arthralgias and myalgias could not be assessed in 18 of the 68 patients because they were sedated and paralyzed, or they were young children who could not communicate the presence of pain. Univariate analysis demonstrated that significant risk factors for arthralgias or myalgias associated with quinupristin-dalfopristin were female sex, chronic liver disease, receipt of liver transplant, elevated bilirubin level at baseline, major surgery, and receipt of either mycophenolate or cyclosporine. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong association with chronic liver disease, receipt of liver transplant, elevated bilirubin level at baseline, and receipt of either cyclosporine or mycophenolate. Of 50 evaluable patients receiving quinupristin-dalfopristin, 25 had pain that may have been associated with this antimicrobial agent. The mechanism for development of arthralgias or myalgias associated with quinupristin-dalfopristin remains unknown, but these adverse events are more likely to occur in patients with chronic liver disease and those who have received a liver transplant or are receiving cyclosporine or mycophenolate.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.8X10-29 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dalfopristin will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase dalfopristin will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Dalfopristin contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dalfopristin is expected to have very slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2800. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.5X10-30 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available. If released into water, dalfopristin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to dalfopristin may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dalfopristin is produced or administered. Exposure to dalfopristin among the general population will be limited to those administered the drug, an antibiotic. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

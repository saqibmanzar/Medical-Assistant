PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

The IR spectra tells you what types of vibrational mode (motion) responses occur in a molecule interacting with infrared light.  It is used to help determine the functional groups in a molecule.",

It probably is seldom a pure compound, but rather a mixture of o-, m-, and p-cresyl and phenyl phosphates. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.0X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days. Particulate-phase p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Based on a reported direct photolysis half-life of 4.86 years in aqueous solution for the isomeric mixture, direct photolysis is not expected to be an important fate process. If released to soil, p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.8X10+4. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.0X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. p-Cresyl diphenyl phosphate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation in soil or in water is expected to be an important environmental fate process based upon observed biodegradability in river and lake water of isomeric mixtures of cresyl diphenyl phosphate. Aqueous hydrolysis will contribute to soil degradation in moist alkaline soil. If released into water, p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An observed BCF range of 110 to 1420 for similar triaryl phosphates suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Reported hydrolysis half-lives of 47 days at pH 7 and 5.1 days at pH 9 at 25 \u00b0C indicate hydrolysis is expected to contribute to degradation water, especially in alkaline water. Occupational exposure to p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate (as part of the commercial isomeric mixture) may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate is produced or used. The general population can be exposed via dermal contact with consumer products containing p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase p-cresyl diphenyl phosphate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.4 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.2X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). Particulate-phase p-cresyl diphenyl  phosphate may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Based on a reported direct photolysis half-life of 4.86 years for the isomeric cresyl diphenyl phosphate mixture in aqueous solution(3), direct photolysis is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

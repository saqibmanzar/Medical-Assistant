It also elicits sedative-hypnotic and weak local anesthetic actions in addition to antibacterial and antifungal properties. Similar in nature to chloral hydrate, it is formed by the simple nucleophilic addition of chloroform and acetone.   As a long-term stabilizer of multi-ingredient preparations, chlorobutanol is normally used at a concentration of 0.5%. At this concentration, it also conserves its antimicrobial activity.   Due to the long terminal half-life of 37 days, the use of chlorobutanol as a sedative is limited because of the considerable accumulation which will occur following multiple dosing. Chlorobutanol is a common detergent preservative in eye drops and other ophthalmic therapeutic formulations.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

A study proposes that the antiplatelet effect of chlorobutanol may occur from inhibition of the arachidonic acid pathway. It attenuated thromboxane B2 formation, elevation of cytosolic free calcium, and ATP release, and additionally exhibited a significant inhibitory activity toward several aggregation inducers in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Chlorobutanol may exert a direct negative inotropic effect on myocardial cells to isometric tension produced by the heart. Chlorobutanol was shown to induce conjunctival and corneal cell toxicity _in vitro_: at a concentration of 0.1%, Cbl caused near depletion of the squamous layer while degeneration of corneal epithelial cells, generation of conspicuous membranous blebs, cytoplasmic swelling, and occasional breaks in the external cell membrane were observed at a concentration of 0.5%.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

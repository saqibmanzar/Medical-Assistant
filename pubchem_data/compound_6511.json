PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Organic lead cmpd are also absorbed through the skin of both humans and exptl animals. Tetraethyl lead and tetramethyl lead are oxidatively dealkylated in the body. Any inorganic lead produced endogenously is distributed in the same pattern as admin inorganic lead, but the parent cmpd and the intermediate dealkylated products are distributed quite differently and in accordance with their lipophilicity. In humans exposed to tetraethyl lead, concn of the parent cmpd and its metabolites, including inorganic lead, are highest in the liver and kidneys followed by the brain and heart ... The highest concn of total lead in rats after exposure to alkyl leads are found in the kidney and liver, followed by the brain. In humans, tetraethyl lead was found to be excreted in the urine as diethyl lead and inorganic lead. In rats and rabbits, dialkyl lead is the major metabolite found in urine. Tetraalkyl leads would also be excreted in the feces as inorganic lead, the end product of metabolism. In humans, exhalation of tetraethyl lead and tetramethyl lead from the lung is a major route of excretion, accounting for 40% (tetramethyl lead) and 20% (tetraethyl lead) of the inhaled dose at 48 hr after inhalation.."

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Lead content in gasoline peaked in 1973 at an average of 2.2 grams per gallon, which amounted to about 200,000 tons of lead used per year in the United States. In 1995 leaded fuel accounted for only 0.6% of total gasoline sales and less than 2,000 tons of lead per year. Effective January 1, 1996, the Clean Air Act banned the sale of the small amount of leaded fuel that was still available in some parts of the country for use in on-road vehicles. (Fuel containing lead was still permitted for som off-road uses, including aircraft, racing cars, farm equipment, and marine engines). In 1996, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank) recommended global phase-out of leaded gasoline. ... Following a phase-down period, in 2000 the European Economic Community also banned most leaded gasoline. ... Leaded gasoline is still being phased out in most developing nations. The \"Declaration of Dakar,\" approved June 28, 2001, involved the World Bank and 25 sub-Saharan African nations in a plan to clean up the air quality in African cities. The most important part of the program was a phase-out of leaded gasoline. ... Still, some nations such as Iraq and Jordan continue to use leaded gasoline."

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Shortly after manufacture began, workers at all three plants began to become floridly psychotic and die. A moratorium on TEL production was put into place, but was lifted in 1926. Between 1926 and 1965, the prevailing consensus was that lead toxicity occurred only at high levels of exposure and that lead in the atmosphere was harmless. Most of the data on lead toxicity issued from a single source, the Kettering Laboratory in Cincinnati. In 1959, the first warnings of adverse health effects of lead at silent doses were raised by Clair Patterson, a geochemist. In hearings before the Senate Committee on Public Works, Senator Edward Muskie raised the question of adverse health effects from airborne lead. As new data accumulated on health effects of lead at lower doses, the movement to remove lead from gasoline gained momentum, and the Environmental Protection Agency examined the question. The removal of lead would take place over the next 25 years, and its accomplishment would require a severe change in the federal stance regarding its hazard. This article details the interaction of various forces, industrial, regulatory, judicial, public health, and public interest, that were engaged in this contest and estimates the value of this step.",

Nichols Medal from the New York section of the American Chemical Society. Thus ... leaded gasoline was introduced on the market in February 1923. ... The biggest problem at this point was the manufacturing process for TEL was not safe ... Inevitably, refinery workers were routinely exposed to highly concentrated lead vapor. Seven workers died between September 1923 and the fall of 1924 in GM's Dayton, Ohio and DuPont's southern New Jersey factories, but no one outside the Ethyl partnership understood the significance of these apparently disconnected industrial accidents. Then, as Standard Oil started up a new and even mor hazardous TEL refining operation in northern New Jersey, five workers died in one week from lead poisoning so severe that it was not initially recognized by occupational health experts. ... The public controversy began October 27, 1924, when what seemed to be a mysterious gas began poisoning workers in the new section of the Standard Oil refinery near Elisabeth, New Jersey, just across the river from New York City.  Several workers had to be subdued and put into straightjackets. They were black and blue from uncontrolled muscle spasms. They exhibited paranoid and delusional behavior such as cringing from phantoms or snatching at imaginary winged insects. The afflicted workers could be suddenly violent or suicidal. They also had blue lines across their gums, a typical indicator of lead poisoning, but the behavioral symptoms were unlike any presented in previous lead-poisoning cases. When the first worker died in the hospital, writhing in agony, ... a county medical examiner called the district attorney, who began an investigation. This alerted the news media, and on October 27, accounts of the odd new kind of occupational hazard were carried on the front pages of newspapers around the world. ... Yale professor Yandell Henderson, a leading expert on the effects of gas warfare and automobile exhaust, told newspapers that the mystery gas was called \"tetraethyl lead\". ... Despite public relations efforts /by the manufacturer/, the New Jersey Labor Commission shut down the Bayway refinery in early November, and a Union County prosecutor started a grand jury investigation (it ended in February 1925 with no charges filed)."

It exhibits similar competitive inhibition at the NMDA receptor and protein kinase C, which impairs brain microvascular formation and function, as well as alters the blood-brain barrier. Lead also affects the nervous system by impairing regulation of dopamine synthesis and blocking evoked release of acetylcholine. However, it's main mechanism of action occurs by inhibiting delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, an enzyme vital in the biosynthesis of heme, which is a necesssary cofactor of hemoglobin.

In urine: 24-hour urine lead levels, delta aminolevulinic acid and coproporphyrin. Sample collection: a 24-hour specimen of urine is preferable to a single specimen; the blood sample should be taken and stored in specially cleaned glassware... Lead in urine after calcium disodium EDTA mobilization test ... In case of recent exposure or poisoning: whole-blood levels rarely exceeds 500 ug/L. Red cell delta-aminolevulinic dehydratase activity is inhibited (normal 30 to 60 IU). The concentration of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes may be increased (normal: 600 ug/L), but the results are inconsistent. In severe organic lead poisoning the concentration of lead in urine is rarely less than 3500 ug/L. The urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA-U) (normal: 4.5 mg/L) and the urinary coproporphyrin (CP-U) (normal: 150 ug/L) may be increased. The urinary lead excretion is increased by calcium disodium EDTA or D-penicillamine). Anemia and basophilic stippling are uncommon. These findings occur in chronic exposure, as in gasoline sniffing cases, but the chemical and morphological abnormalities in blood are absent in acute exposure ... Other biomedical (diagnostic) investigations and their interpretation: Serum creatinine, urinalysis, 24-hour creatinine and protein (evaluation of renal function). Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT): muscle and hepatic damage. Peripheral motor nerve conduction velocity (damage to peripheral nerves) only in cases of chronic exposure.

Exposure was performed by gastric gavage using corn oil as the vehicle. The mice were exposed daily for 14 consecutive days. The high dose (2.0 mg/kg) produced nervous system toxicity, as seen in tremors which began about day 5 of exposure. Tetraethyl Lead produced dose dependent decreases in erythrocyte number, hematocrit and peripheral blood leukocytes, suggesting the bone marrow as a target. There was a slight but significant increase in BUN, suggesting an effect on the kidney. Histopathological evaluation was negative with respect to the lymphoid tissue, but a mild chronic hepatitis was observed in the middle and high dose groups.  The studies were limited to Tier 1 evaluation because of a lack of effects on the following immune parameters of B6C3F1 mice exposed to Tetraethyl Lead: IgM antibody forming cell response to the T-dependent antigen sheep erythrocytes, mixed lymphocyte response, and delayed hypersensitivity response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Serum complement levels, as measured by total hemolytic activity (CH50), were decreased dose dependently. Since decreased serum complement levels have been associated with an increased susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae, this organism was selected as the host resistance model. However, exposure to Tetraethyl Lead did not alter resistance of mice to Streptococcus pneumoniae. One mechanism by which complement is involved with host resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae is by opsonizing the bacteria with C3 and C3 cleavage products which facilitate phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages. Serum C3 levels in mice exposed to Tetraethyl Lead were unaffected, explaining the absence of effect on host resistance. Tetraethyl Lead apparently affects some component of complement other than C3."

The use of tetraalkyl lead additives in on-road automotive gasoline is no longer permitted in the United States; however tetraethyl lead is still used in leaded aviation gasoline. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.26 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tetraethyl lead will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase tetraethyl lead will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.1 hours. Half-lives for the direct photolysis of vapor-phase tetraethyl lead exposed to bright sunlight at solar zenith angles of 40 and 75 deg are 2.3 and 9.0 hours, respectively. If released to soil, organic matter in the soil will influence tetraethyl lead's mobility because possibilities exist for inhibited mobility by sorption to soil organic matter and for enhanced mobility by the formation of soluble chelate complexes with soluble organic anions.  Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.568 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Tetraethyl lead is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Approximately 70 to 90% disappearance of C-14 labeled tetraethyl lead from both sterile and non-sterile soils was observed within 8 hours to 3 days indicating that abiotic processes were primarily responsible for the degradation of this substance; however, a more rapid initial rate of biodegradation in the non-sterile soils indicated that some biodegradation was taking place as well. If released into water, organic matter in the suspended solids and sediment may influence tetraethyl lead's mobility. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.3 hours and 7.1 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 53 days when adsorption is considered. Measured BCF values ranging from 120 to 18,138 suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. Tetraethyl lead is expected to undergo hydrolysis based on half-lives of approximately 8 days in freshwater and 14 hours in seawater. Occupational exposure to tetraethyl lead may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tetraethyl lead is produced or used. The use of tetraalkyl lead additives in on-road automotive gasoline is no longer permitted in the United States; however tetraethyl lead is still used in leaded aviation gasoline. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to tetraethyl lead via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with this compound and other products containing tetraethyl lead, such as leaded gasoline.

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(2), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.3 hours and 7.1 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The volatilization half-life from a model pond is about 53 days when adsorption is considered(4). According to a classification scheme(5), BCF values ranging from 120 to 18,138(6,7) suggest bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC). Tetraethyl lead is expected to undergo hydrolysis based on reported hydrolysis half-lives of approximately 8 days in freshwater and 14 hours in seawater(8,9). Some biodegradation of tetraethyl lead in water is expected to occur based on a more rapid initial rate of degradation measured in non-sterile soil than in sterile soil (70-90% degradation after 8 hours and 18 hours, respectively); however, abiotic mechanisms are considered to be the dominant degradation processes for this substance(10).

Vapor-phase tetraethyl lead is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 6.1 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 6.3X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The rate constants for direct photolysis of vapor-phase tetraethyl lead exposed to bright sunlight at solar zenith angles of 40 and 75 deg have been experimentally determined to be 5.1X10-3/min and 1.29X10-3/min, respectively(4).

The initial concentration of tetraethyl lead (labeled and non-labeled) was approximately 10 ug/g(1). All C-14 labeled tetraethyl lead was removed from both sterile and non-sterile soil after 28 days during a soil-die away study(2). Initial degradation was more rapid in the non-sterile soil than in the sterile soil with 70-90% degradation after 8 hours and 18 hours, respectively(2). This difference along with the observation of C-14 CO2 evolution indicated that some biodegradation was taking place(2). Disappearance of 14-C labeled tetraethyl lead was reported to be greater than 90% within 1 day in non-sterile soil and greater than 90% within 3 days in autoclaved soil(1). Based on these data, it was estimated that biodegradation was responsible for 10-20% of the degradation of tetraethyl lead during the first day of incubation; abiotic degradation was considered to be the major factor resulting in the disappearance of this substance(1). Tetraethyl lead was completely degraded within 14 days in soil not contaminated with gasoline (initial concentration of 1.315 ug/g); however, 4 to 17% of the applied tetraethyl lead remained after 77 days in soil contaminated with 1000 to 5000 ug/g gasoline(3). The slower rate of degradation observed in the gasoline-contaminated soil was attributed to the high solubility of tetraethyl lead in gasoline and the protection from biotic and abiotic degradation processes that petroleum hydrocarbons provide for tetraethyl lead(3). Sieved agricultural soil samples were treated with tetraethyl lead and the resulting effects were analyzed by microcalorimetry(4). At an initial concentration of 2 g/kg dry weight in soil, the biodegradation rate was about 780 umol/day kg dry weight(4). At higher concentrations, the biodegradation of tetraethyl lead was less pronounced. At an initial concn of 10 g/kg dry weight in soil, 75% of tetraethyl lead still remained after 10 days(4)."

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6.1 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). Reaction of tetraethyl lead with hydroxyl radicals yields triethyl lead compounds, diethyl lead compounds and inorganic lead, with the ionic alkyllead compounds occurring in either the gas-phase or in aerosol form(3). The hydrolysis half-life of tetraethyl lead in fresh water at pH 7 and 40 \u00b0C was reported to be approximately 8 days(4). The rate constant for chemical hydrolysis of tetraethyl lead in seawater is reported to be 1.33X10-5/sec(5); this corresponds to a half-life of 14 hrs(SRC). Triethyl lead chloride has been identified as a reaction product(5,6). Degradation of tetraethyl lead in water results in the formation of trialkyl and dialkyl lead compounds(7). Copper and iron ions have been found to catalyze the decomposition of tetraethyl lead in water(8). The rate constants for direct photolysis of vapor-phase tetraethyl lead exposed to bright sunlight at solar zenith angles of 40 and 75 deg have been experimentally determined to be 5.1X10-3/min and 1.29X10-3/min, respectively(9). These values correspond to respective photolytic half-lives of 2.3 and 9.0 hours in air(SRC).",

Most uncombusted tetraalkyl lead compounds in the atmosphere undergo rapid photolytic decomposition to ionic elemental lead, which settles out on the ground and becomes bound to soil organic matter(2). In distilled water, tetraethyl lead is fairly stable with only 2% decomposing to triethyl lead in 77 days(2). However, the rate of decomposition increases with decreasing water purity(2).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

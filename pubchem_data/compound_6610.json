Addition of phenyl hydroquinone (O.5 or 0.75 mM) to hepatocytes resulted in dose-dependent cell death accompanied by the abrupt depletion of both glutathione and protein thiols and the accumulation of phenyl-benzoquinone. Pretreatment with diethyl maleate (1.25 mM) which causes an abrupt depletion of cellular glutathione in hepatocytes delayed the onset of phenyl hydroquinone-induced cytotoxicity. The delay correlated with inhibition of phenyl benzoquinone formation. Among other hydroquinones (0.5 mM), tert-butyl-hydroquinone-induced cytotoxicity was decreased by diethyl maleate (1.25 mM), but diethyl maleate did not affect the cytotoxicity of 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone. Phenyl-hydroquinone -induced cytotoxicity correlated with the accumulation of phenyl-benzoquinone in the cell.",

The test substance was administered in single oral doses to three groups of fasted young albino Sprague-Dawley rats (number and sex of rats was not reported) at a dosage of 1000 mg/kg of body weight. Treated rats were evaluated at intervals of 6, 18, and 30 hours. Approximately 2 hours before each sacrifice time, rats were administered colchicine at 4 mg/kg of body weight to arrest cells in metaphase. Both femurs were removed from sacrificed animals and metaphase slides were prepared for scoring of chromosome aberrations. All rats exhibited mild to severe toxic signs, including diarrhea, abnormal gait, and stance. In the 18 hour group, toxic signs included decreased body tone and inactivity. In the 30 hour group, toxic signs included yellow to brown wet pellage in the anal-genital region and decreased body tone. From the 18 hour harvest group 2 females died. From each animal, 50 metaphase cells were analyzed. There were no statistically significant increase in the incidence of aberrations or number of aberrant metaphases observed at any of the three sampling times, therefore, the test substance was classified as not clastogenic.",

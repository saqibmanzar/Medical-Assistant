PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Using this approach, we have detected 12 distinct silicon-containing peaks in PDMS-V poly(dimethylsiloxane) oil by GC/AED, and we have used GC/MS analysis to identify some of the abundant peaks by MS spectral matching. Polydimethylpolysiloxanes contain 37.8% silicon; therefore, the amount of poly(dimethylsiloxane) in each peak can be calculated from its silicon content. The first three GC peaks from PDMS-V were identified as dodecamethylpentasiloxane, tetradecamethylhexasiloxane, and hexadecamethylheptasiloxane using Wiley Mass Spectral Library match (> 90%). Peaks 4-12 could not be matched unequivocally with the spectral library but showed ionic fragments characteristic of PDMS (73, 147, 221, 281, 295, and 369 amu). The detection limit for silicones using GC/AED and GC/MS systems was found to be 80 and 10 pg/uL, respectively. Studies were conducted using mouse liver homogenates spiked with varying amounts of PDMS-V, and the recovery was found to be greater than 90% over a wide range of PDMS-V concentrations. This method appears to work equally well for both linear and cyclic poly(dimethylsiloxane)s. Thus, the methodology described here has the potential to allow the measurement of less than 1 microgram of silicone/g of biological tissue. The overall goal of this research is to establish and validate a methodology by which the unequivocal identification and quantitation of poly(dimethylsiloxane)s can be accomplished.",

If released to air, an extrapolated vapor pressure of 4.50X10-2 mm Hg at 24 \u00b0C indicates dodecamethylpentasiloxane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dodecamethylpentasiloxane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 9 days. Dodecamethylpentasiloxane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dodecamethylpentasiloxane is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.1X10+6. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 320 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation data in soil and water were not available. If released into water, dodecamethylpentasiloxane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hrs and 8 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. An estimated BCF of 880 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to dodecamethylpentasiloxane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dodecamethylpentasiloxane is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dodecamethylpentasiloxane via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with a limited number of personal care products containing this compound.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 320 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 4.50X10-2 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 7.04X10-5 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hrs and 8 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 29 yrs if adsorption is considered(7). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 880(SRC), from its log Kow of 9.41(8) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2018).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

In the present work, an analytical method based on ultrasound-assisted solid-liquid extraction (USAE) followed by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) has been optimized and applied to assess the presence of eight volatile dimethyl siloxanes (VMS) (hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3), octamethylcyclotetra-siloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5), dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6), octamethyltrisiloxane (MDM), decamethyltetrasiloxane (MD2M) and dodecamethylpentasiloxane (MD3M) and tetradecamethylhexasiloxane (MD4M)) in fish. The optimized method presented limits of quantification between 0.1 and 1.3 pg/g for linear volatile dimethylsiloxanes (lVMS) and between 13 and 39 pg/g for cyclic volatile dimethylsiloxanes (cVMS) and intraday relative standard deviation (between 1.9 and 7.0%). Recovery yields were between 71 and 92%. 40 fish samples collected in different markets in Barcelona, (Spain), and 16 samples of fish directly collected at the Xuquer River were analysed. cVMS were detected in almost all the river fish samples at concentrations between pg/g and ng/g, with a significant correlation between the fat content and VMS concentrations in fish. In addition, significant higher concentrations were found in market samples, suggesting sources of contamination from their manipulation and storage in indoor environments. Multivariate analyses were applied to the results and the siloxane profiles and analyte correlations are discussed.",

Therefore, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed spacecraft maximum allowable concentrations (SMACs) for siloxane vapors to protect astronaut health. Since publication of these original SMACs, new studies and new risk assessment approaches have been published that warrant re-examination of the SMACs. OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate SMACs published for octamethyltrisiloxane (L3) for exposures ranging from 1 hour to 180 days, to develop a 1000-day SMAC, and to expand the applicability of those values to the family of linear siloxanes. METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify studies conducted since the SMACs for L3 were set in 1994. The updated data were reviewed to determine the sensitive toxicity endpoints, and current risk assessment approaches and methods for dosimetric adjustments were evaluated. RESULTS: Recent data were used to update the original 1-hour, 24-hour, 30-day, and 180-day SMACs for L3, and a 1000-day SMAC was developed to protect crewmembers during future exploration beyond Earth orbit. Group SMACs for the linear siloxane family, including hexamethyldisiloxane (L2), L3, decamethyltetrasiloxane (L4), and dodecamethylpentasiloxane (L5), were set for exposures of 1-hour to 1000 days. CONCLUSION: New SMACs, based on acute pulmonary and neurotoxicity at high doses only achievable with L2 and potential liver effects following longer-term exposures to L2 and L3, were established to protect crewmembers from the adverse effects of exposure to linear siloxanes.",

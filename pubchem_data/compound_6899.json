When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The pheromone pesticide mixture also killed significantly more ticks than the treatment without pheromone. This increased effectiveness was due almost entirely to the significantly greater kill of male ticks.

The method is based on the hydrolysis of the phenolic compounds in urine and subsequent derivatization with acetic anhydride. To determine the accuracy and precision of the method, pooled urine from unexposed persons spiked with definite amounts of each chlorophenol was analyzed. Concentrations were between 58 and 220 ug/l. Recoveries ranged between 87 and 119%. The coefficients of variation were between 4.4 and 10.1%. The detection limit for each chlorophenol in urine ranged between 4.9 and 18.6 ug/L.",

Exposure to this crystalline substance may occur from dermal contact or inhalation at sites where it is used as a chemical intermediate in the production of pentachlorophenol. Effects of exposure include irritation or injury to the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. Personnel handling 2,6-dichlorophenol should wear protective clothing, gloves, boots, goggles, and an approved dust respirator. In an emergency situation, a self-contained breathing apparatus is recommended. If contact with the material does occur, immdeiately flush skin or eyes with running water for at least 15 minutes. Contaminated clothing should be removed and isolated at the site. 2,6-Dichlorophenol does not burn easily, but heat or fire will cause this substance to produce irritating and poisonous gases. For small fires involving 2,6-dichlorophenol, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, water spray, or foam, and for large fires, use water spray, fog, or standard foam. Fire control water should be prevented from entering water sources or sewers. 2,6-Dichlorophenol may be shipped via air, rail, road, or water in containers bearing the label, \"Keep away from food.\" Small spills of 2,6-dichlorophenol solution may be taken up with sand or other noncombustible absorbent and placed in closed containers for later disposal. Large spills of 2,6-dichlorophenol (solution) should be contained in pits, or other holding areas that are sealed with an impermeable flexible membrane liner. Runoff should be controlled by diking. Solids should be covered with a plastic sheet. Spills of 2,6-dichlorophenol in water may be trapped at the bottom with sand bag barriers, activated charcoal applied, and trapped material removed with suction hoses, mechanical dredges, or lifts. 2,6-Dichlorophenol is a good candidate for rotary kiln incineration. Prior to implementing land disposal of waste residue (including waste sludge), consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

Equivocal relationships between chlorophenols and cases of soft tissue sarcoma, malignant lymphoma (Hodgkins disease and non-Hodgkins lymphoma), nasal and nasopharyngeal cancer and lung cancer have been reported.

Oral administration, however, results in fatal poisoning in smaller dosage and in a shorter period of time than sc administration. Restlessness and an increased rate of respiration appear a few minutes after administration of o- and m-chlorophenols and are followed a few minutes later by a rapidly developing motor weakness. Tremors, clonic convulsions (which can be induced by noise or touch), dyspnea and coma set in promptly & continue until death. Similar signs are produced by p-chlorophenol, but the convulsions are more severe. 2,4- & 2,6-dichlorophenols & 2,4,6- & 2,4,5-trichlorophenols produce these signs also, but decreased activity & motor weakness do not appear quite so promptly. The tremors are much less severe, but in this case, also, they continue until a few minutes before death. /Chlorophenols/",

The activities of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase in serum as well as in liver were increased provisionally and decreased after 1 or 2 week administration. Liver mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by chlorophenol treatment in in vivo and in vitro tests. Liver microsomal cytochrome p450 was decreased by chlorophenol administration.

Ova were prepared from female CB6F1-mice and sperm suspensions from male CD1-mice. The preparations were incubated together with or without 2,3-dichlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,5-dichlorophenol, 2,6-dichlorophenol, 3,4-dichlorophenol, 3,5-dichlorophenol, or cadmium-chloride at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 millimole (mmol) per liter. Sperm motility was examined by light microscopy before and after chemical exposure. Following incubation, ova were scored for sperm penetration under phase contrast optics. Male mice also received 2,4-dichlorophenol in drinking water at doses of 0, 50, 150, or 500 mg/kg/day for 90 days. Sperm were then prepared and tested for penetration of ova in-vitro. Acrosome integrity was examined in sperm incubated in-vitro with 0.001 Molar concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol, 3,4-dichlorophenol, and 3,5-dichlorophenol for 60 minutes. Sperm penetration of ova in-vitro was significantly depressed by 2,5-dichlorophenol (20%), 3,4-dichlorophenol (90%), 3,5-dichlorophenol (9%), and cadmium-chloride (93%), all at the 1 mmol concentration. Sperm penetration was not affected by 2,4-dichlorophenol in drinking water for 90 days at any concentration tested nor was sperm motility affected by the in-vitro exposure to dichlorophenol. Acrosomes were decreased 33% by 2,5-dichlorophenol, 45% by 3,4-dichlorophenol, and 60% by 3,5-dichlorophenol.",

LBR is defined as the concentration of the compound in the organism, on molar basis, to cause death, and the LBR(50) is defined as the calculated LBR value to cause a 50% mortality in population after a given time. Groups of 30 or 40 organisms were exposed to different chlorophenol concentrations in artificial soft fresh water to achieve differential mortality. Exposure times were either 24 hr or 48 hr. In addition to exposures with individual congeners, mixtures of chlorophenols were also tested. After each exposure, the surviving organisms were collected and the body burden of chlorophenols was measured by gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The measured body burden was related to the percent mortality in the group. The trichlorophenols and pentachlorophenol have a 48-hr LBR(50) of 0.45-0.66 umol/g wet weight in L. variegatus. The 48-hr LBR(50) of pentachlorophenol for C. riparius was 0.15 umol/g wet weight, indicating a slight difference in the sensitivity of these two species. The 48-hr LBR(50) of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol is 0.91 umol/g wet weight, and the value for 2,6-dichlorophenol is 1.2 umol/g wet weight in L. variegatus. The 48-hr LBR(50)s of the chlorophenol mixtures ranged from 0.50 to 0.83 umol/g wet weight, demonstrating an additive toxicity.",

Its formation as a result of water treatment and wood pulp processing will result in its direct release to the environment. It may occur naturally in soil via direct synthesis by soil fungi or fungi-derived enzymes utilizing humic phenols, and through degradation of soil fungi metabolites. Chlorophenols may be released into the environment through burning of biomass during forest fires. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.033 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,6-dichlorophenol will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,6-dichlorophenol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 5 days. 2,6-Dichlorophenol contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,6-dichlorophenol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon a Koc of 410. The fate of different chlorophenols in soil is probably affected by many factors, such as the water solubility of each chlorophenol, pH of the soil, rainfall, soil organic matter content, type and particle size of the soil, biological and photodegradation and the evaporation of each chlorophenol. The pKa of 2,6-dichlorophenol is 6.79, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.67X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. 2,6-Dichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure of 0.033 mm Hg. Biodegradation half-lives of about 59 hours in basic soils and 389 hours in acidic soils suggest that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. If released into water, 2,6-dichlorophenol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc of 410 .The biodegradation half-life of 2,6-dichlorophenol was reported as 1000 hours in water, suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 and 130 days, respectively. A BCF range of 4.1 to 20 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 2,6-dichlorophenol may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,6-dichlorophenol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,6-dichlorophenol via ingestion of drinking water, and via dermal contact with this compound. 2,6-Dichlorophenol has been detected in groundwater, surface waters, sea water, rain water, sewage effluents, industrial effluents, and in the atmosphere in urban/suburban and rural areas. 2,6-Dichlorophenol has been detected in human urine in both adults and children.

The pKa of 2,6-dichlorophenol is 6.79(4), indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of 2,6-dichlorophenol from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.67X10-6 atm-cu m/mole, derived from its vapor pressure, 0.033 mm Hg(6), and water solubility, 1,900 mg/L(7). 2,6-Dichlorophenol is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(6). Biodegradation half-lives of about 59 hours in basic soils and 389 hours in acidic soils(8) suggest that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC).",

The soil around the treatment basins contained up to 70 mg chlorophenols/kg and that in the storage area for treated lumber up to 6 mg/kg. Contamination extended to a depth of at least 2 m near the treatment basins. Surface water inside the sawmill area contained the same chlorophenols as those used in wood preservation, plus some additional isomers. The ground water and lake water around the sawmill areas were contaminated. 2,6-Dichlorophenol was one of several chlorinated phenols detected. The fate of different chlorophenols in soil is probably affected by many factors, such as the water solubility of each chlorophenol, pH of the soil, rainfall, soil organic matter content, type and particle size of the soil, biological and photodegradation and the evaporation of each chlorophenol(1).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.67X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.033 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 1,900 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 18 and 130 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), a measured BCF of 4.1 to 20(7), and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The biodegradation half-life of 2,6-dichlorophenol was reported as 1000 hours in water(9), suggesting that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

Under aerobic sealed flask conditions, 100% of added 2,6-dichlorophenol degraded within 0.75 days in a clay loam soil while only 55% degraded in 40 days in sterilized soil controls(2). Approximately 68% of initially added 2,6-dichlorophenol remained after 12 weeks of incubation in four freshwater pond sediments(3). Between 91.7 and 100% of the 2,6-dichlorophenol initially added to a freshwater pond sediment (which had been contaminated with asphalt) was observed to degrade within two weeks, after a lag period of approximatelyly four weeks(3). The half-life of 2,6-dichlorophenol in an aquifer slurry was measured as 20 days(4). Microcosms isolated from a sewage treatment facility biodegraded 2,6-dichlorophenol to 2-chlorophenol, with an observed half-life of about 2 days(5). The biodegradation half-life of 2,6-dichlorophenol was reported as about 59 hours in basic soils, 389 hours in acidic soils and 1000 hours in water(6).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Concn of 2,6-dichlorophenol in cocoa powder and packaging materials of contaminating sack and normal sack were: contaminating sack: 7 ug/kg cocoa powder, 100 ug/kg glued seams, & 41 ug/kg paper sacking; normal sack: less than 1 ug/kg cocoa powder, 4 ug/kg glued seams, less than 1 ug/kg paper sacking. 2,6 & 2,4-dichlorophenol, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, & 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol were present in the tainted cocoa powder in such high concn that they would be expected to taint beverages & other food items prepared from it. The packaging material was the most likely source of the contamination. However, it is possible that the 2,6-dichlorophenols in the cocoa powder were derived from the microbial metabolism of chlorophenoxyacetic acid herbicides which are still used in some cocoa producing countries.",

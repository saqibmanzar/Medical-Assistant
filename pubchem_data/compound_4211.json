ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The median disease free interval after surgery was 12.1 months. Tumor dissemination occurred in 82% of the patients, most commonly to the lung, liver and adjacent organs. The median survival time was 14.5 months, and the 5 yr survival was 22%. Age over 40 yr and the presence of metastases at the time of diagnosis were the only factors recognized as indicating a poor prognosis. Mitotane controlled hormonal secretion in 75% of the patients. Eight mitotane treated patients had partial tumor regression, but the drug did not have a significant effect on survival. It was concluded that adrenocortical carcinoma carries a poor prognosis; mitotane therapy may offer transient benefits, particularly in controlling endocrine symptoms.",

Seventeen consecutive patients who were treated with mitotane after radical resection of adrenocortical cancer (ACC) from 1999 to 2005 underwent physical examination, routine laboratory evaluation, monitoring of mitotane concentrations, and a hormonal work-up at baseline and every 3 months till ACC relapse or study end (December 2007). Mitotane toxicity was graded using NCI CTCAE criteria. All biochemical measurements were performed at our center and plasma mitotane was measured by an in-house HPLC assay. All the patients reached mitotane concentrations >14 mg/L and none of them discontinued definitively mitotane for toxicity; 14 patients maintained consistently elevated mitotane concentrations despite tapering of the drug. Side effects occurred in all patients but were manageable with palliative treatment and adjustment of hormone replacement therapy. Mitotane affected adrenal steroidogenesis with a more remarkable inhibition of cortisol and DHEAS than aldosterone. Mitotane induced either perturbation of thyroid function mimicking central hypothyroidism or, in male patients, inhibition of testosterone secretion. The discrepancy between salivary and serum cortisol, as well as between total and free testosterone, is due to the mitotane-induced increase in hormone-binding proteins which complicates interpretation of hormone measurements. ...",

Before and 1 and 2 or more weeks after starting mitotane we determined the platelet counts, bleeding times and global coagulation parameters. All patients had a normal bleeding time before treatment. In 6 cases the bleeding time became prolonged (245-555 s). Four patients exhibited platelet aggregation responses compatible with an aspirin-like defect. It is concluded that mitotane may cause a clinically relevant defect of platelet function.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Although mitotane is an adrenocortical cytotoxic agent, the drug can also apparently inhibit adrenocortical function without causing cellular destruction. Mitotane appears to selectively inhibit adrenocortical function as well as functional and nonfunctional adrenocortical neoplasms by a direct cytotoxic effect; this effect may be mediated through covalent bonding of mitotane metabolites to mitochondrial proteins. The drug causes focal degeneration in the zona fasciculata and reticularis of the adrenal cortex with resultant atrophy. The drug usually causes only minimal degeneration in the zona glomerulosa (site of aldosterone biosynthesis); however, the zona glomerulosa may be damaged with prolonged mitotane therapy. Mitotane also reportedly inhibits the growth of human renal carcinoma cells, astrocytoma cells, and fibroblasts in vitro.",

Mitotane inhibits the normal 11-beta-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycortisol (compound S) and 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) in the adrenal cortex, thus blocking conversion of compound S to cortisol (hydrocortisone) and DOC to corticosterone. The drug can also inhibit 18-hydroxylase activity in the adrenal cortex and thus decrease the production of aldosterone by blocking the conversion of corticosterone to 18-hydroxycorticosterone (the immediate precursor of aldosterone). Mitotane decreases cortisol secretion rate; plasma cortisol concentration; urinary excretion of free cortisol, 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS), 17-ketosteroids (17-KS), and 17-ketogenic steroids; and adrenocortical response to stimulation by corticotropin (ACTH). A feedback increase in plasma corticotropin concentration is generally observed in patients receiving mitotane; however, a lack of feedback increase or a decrease in plasma corticotropin concentration has been observed in some patients. Therefore, it has been suggested that the drug may have a partial suppressive effect on pituitary corticotropin-secreting cells. Mitotane apparently increases the extra-adrenal metabolism of cortisol to 6-beta-hydroxycortisol which results in decreased urinary excretion of measurable 17-OHCS; this occurs even in the presence of unchanged cortisol secretion rate or plasma cortisol concentration. Although urinary excretion of aldosterone metabolites may decrease, serum aldosterone concentrations may remain in the normal range. Therefore, it has been suggested that mitotane may also alter the extra-adrenal metabolism of aldosterone. Mitotane decreases the extra-adrenal conversion of androgens to androsterone and etiocholanolone; this results in decreased urinary excretion of 17-KS. The drug also inhibits the extra-adrenal conversion of 3-beta-hydroxysteroids to 3-alpha-hydroxypregnane derivatives.",

These kits should be readily available in all areas where hazardous drugs are routinely handled. If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

DDD reduces potassium transport across the membrane. DDD inhibits the inactivation of voltaged-gated sodium channels. The channels activate (open) normally but are inactivated (closed) slowly, thus interfering with the active transport of sodium out of the nerve axon during repolarization and resulting in a state of hyperexcitability. DDD inhibits neuronal adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases), particularly Na+K+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase which play vital roles in neuronal repolarization. DDD also inhibits the ability of calmodulin, a calcium mediator in nerves, to transport calcium ions that are essential for the release of neurotransmitters. All these inhibited functions reduce the rate of depolarization and increase the sensitivity of neurons to small stimuli that would not elicit a response in a fully depolarized neuron. DDD is also believed to adversely affect the reproductive system by mimicking endogenous hormones and binding to the estrogen and adrogen receptors. (T10, L85)",

Seventeen consecutive patients who were treated with mitotane after radical resection of adrenocortical cancer (ACC) from 1999 to 2005 underwent physical examination, routine laboratory evaluation, monitoring of mitotane concentrations, and a hormonal work-up at baseline and every 3 months till ACC relapse or study end (December 2007). Mitotane toxicity was graded using NCI CTCAE criteria. All biochemical measurements were performed at our center and plasma mitotane was measured by an in-house HPLC assay. All the patients reached mitotane concentrations >14 mg/L and none of them discontinued definitively mitotane for toxicity; 14 patients maintained consistently elevated mitotane concentrations despite tapering of the drug. Side effects occurred in all patients but were manageable with palliative treatment and adjustment of hormone replacement therapy. Mitotane affected adrenal steroidogenesis with a more remarkable inhibition of cortisol and DHEAS than aldosterone. Mitotane induced either perturbation of thyroid function mimicking central hypothyroidism or, in male patients, inhibition of testosterone secretion. The discrepancy between salivary and serum cortisol, as well as between total and free testosterone, is due to the mitotane-induced increase in hormone-binding proteins which complicates interpretation of hormone measurements. ...",

Mitotane is a metabolite of DDT. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.94X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates mitotane will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase mitotane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 90 days. Particulate-phase mitotane will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Mitotane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, mitotane is expected to be immobile based upon an estimated Koc of 1.2X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 8.2X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Mitotane may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure.Biodegradatoin data were not available. If released into water, mitotane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 and 65 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 96 years if adsorption is considered. An estimated BCF of 3,500 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to mitotane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where mitotane is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to mitotane via ingestion of food and drinking water, present as a result of the use of DDT. Exposure to mitotane among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug as an antineoplastic. (SRC)",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 8 and 65 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 96 years if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3,500(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 5.9(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC).

Vapor-phase mitotane is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 90 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.34X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase mitotane may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Mitotane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that mitotane is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 8 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 65 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 96 years if adsorption is considered(4). Mitotane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Mitotane is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Male Wistar-rats were treated orally with 400, 814, and 1250 mg/kg and intraperitoneally with 20, 50 and 75mg/kg. Urine was collected for 48 hours in metabolism cages. Urine spot samples were collected from eight male fruit growers after spraying captan and from six nonexposed men. Capillary gas chromatography in combination with mass or sulfur selective detection was suitable for the qualitative and quantitative determination of THPI and TTCA in rat and human urine. The cumulative urinary excretion of THPI and TTCA accounted for about 5% of the delivered dose of captan. In nonexposed subjects, neither THPI nor TTCA could be detected using the currently available techniques. Occupational exposure to captan resulted in detectable excretion of both TTCA and THPI in urine. The authors conclude that THPI and TTCA have promise as parameters for the biological monitoring of occupational exposure to captan.",

The specificity of a transformation may vary depending on the available scientific evidence. A transformation may involve a series or cascade of changes between the predecessor (reactant) and successor (product). The presence of a successor in a sample may imply the predecessor. Predecessor: chemical being transformed. Transformation: process or medium. Successor: transformation product of predecessor. Evidence: the publication providing evidence for this transformation.

The workers used an air blast sprayer pulled by a tractor to treat an orchard. Personal air samples were used to assess pesticide particle concentrations. Skin pads were used to measure dermal exposure. Skin pads and air samples were analyzed for captan levels using high performance liquid chromatography. Urine samples were collected and analyzed for THPI by gas chromatography with chemical ionization and mass spectrometry. Estimates of total dermal exposure were based on extrapolation to total body exposures from skin pad exposures and compared to estimates based on exposure of skin pads on specific body areas. The highest dermal exposure was on the forehead, followed by the wrists and neck. Average air spraying duration was 211 minutes with a standard deviation of 84 minutes. The amount of captan handled per spraying varied from 1.7 to 22.5 kilograms. Respiratory exposure to captan was not found to contribute to urinary THPI; however, a clear association with urinary THPI was found from the estimations of exposure on the skin pads from the ankles and neck. Other factors such as use of a cabin on the tractor, wearing of gloves during mixing and loading, and the use of rubber boots also correlated very well in THPI in the urine. The authors conclude that dermal exposure data can be better linked to biological monitoring based on empirical findings as gathered in a pilot study rather than on estimates of total skin dose.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.2X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide in exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.6 hours. Particulate-phase 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1,2,3,6-Tetrahydrophthalimide does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 20. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.0X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 0% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not a rapid environmental fate process. If released into water, 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is expected to be an environmental fate process since this compound contains functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide is produced or used. Limited monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide via ingestion of contaminated food that had been treated with the fungicide captan.

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

                                                    "String": "IDENTIFICATION: Nitrofurantoin is an urninary antiseptic and antiinfective drug. It is a lemon yellow solid crystalline material.  It is very sightly soluble in water and alcohol. It is soluble in diethylformamide. In the treatment of initial or recurrent urinary tract infections caused by susceptible gram positive and gram negative bacteria including most strains of Escherischia coli. Enterobacter and Klebsiella species are less susceptible and Pseudomonas and most strains of Proteus are resistant to nitrofurantoin. Nitrofurantoin is ineffective in systemic bacterial infections in blood or tissues outside the urinary tract. HUMAN EXPOSURE: Main risks and target organs: The most frequent adverse effects include anorexia, nausea and vomiting. Nitrofurantoin has also been associated with neurological and central nervous system, hepatic, hematological, pulmonary and dermatological toxicity.  Apart from gastrointestinal tract symptoms, acute reactions as a result of overdosage of nitrofurantoin have not been reported.  Symptoms of toxicity are generally due to hypersensitivity to the drug. Contraindications: Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or to furan derivatives. It is also relatively contraindicated in renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, electrolyte imbalance, vit.B deficiency as there is an increased risk of developing peripheral neuropathy in these situations. If it has to be used in these cases, extreme care should be taken and treatment stopped at the first sign of toxicity. Hemolysis frequently occurs in Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient patients who take       nitrofurantoin. Discontinuation of the drug will often reverse this effect. Nitrofurantoin is contraindicated in pregnant women at term (38-42 weeks gestation) and it should not be administered during labor or just prior to labor to avoid precipitation of hemolytic anemia in the neonate.  Neonates are at high risk of hemolysis induced by nitrofurantoin due to their immature enzyme systems. Routes of exposure: Oral: This is the most common route of entry. Absorption by route of exposure: Nitrofurantoin is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption occurs mainly in the small intestine. The microcrystalline form of the drug (in suspension, tablets or capsules) is absorbed faster than the macrocrystalline form (in capsules). Presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract or delayed gastric emptying increases the extent of absorption (enhancing the dissolution rate of the drug). Bioavailability is a mean of 87% when taken on an empty stomach, and increases to a mean of 94% when ingested with food. Peak plasma concentrations following a single oral dose are usually attained at 1 to 2 hours after ingestion. Distribution by route of exposure: Nitrofurantoin is 25 to 90% bound to plasma protein. It crosses the placenta and is excreted in the milk. Biological half-life by route of exposure: The plasma half life is approximately 20 to 60 minutes in adults with normal renal function after a therapeutic oral dose. The half-life is prolonged in patients with impaired renal function. Metabolism: Approximately 2/3 of a dose is metabolized in the liver.  A small fraction is reduced to aminofurantoin. Elimination by route of exposure: 20 to 44% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours. 1% is excreted as aminofurantoin.  Nitrofurantoin is dialyzable. Mode of action: Toxicodynamics: Nitrofurantoin causes hepatic injury (acute and chronic) through an immunological or metabolic mechanism. Cholestatic jaundice and hepatocellular damage result in elevation of alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase levels. Development of antinuclear antibodies and antismooth muscle antibodies has also been reported.  Pulmonary toxicity is attributed to nitrofurantoin production of superoxide anion free radicals with subsequent chain reactions and uncontrolled destructive oxidation, suggested that nitrofurantoin mediated oxidant injury to the lung may be due to direct cytotoxicity or indirectly through recruitment of activated neutrophils.  Nitrofurantoin can cause an acute non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, or subacute interstitial pneumonitis which may progress to interstitial fibrosis. The acute reaction is generally considered to be a hypersensitivity reaction. There is evidence pointing to an immunological mechanism for injury and an increase in T-Lymphocytes in broncheo-alveolar lavage.  Peripheral neuropathy is a complication of nitrofurantoin therapy especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or diabetes mellitus.  Nitrofurantoin triggers a degenerative process in the nerve cell axon with subsequent impairment of sensation and motor strength in the distal extent of the axonal process. Pharmacodynamics: Nitrofurantoin is bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal depending on the concentration and the susceptibility of the microorganism. Its antibacterial activity is enhanced in an acidic pH. It is thought that nitrofurantoin is reduced by bacterial flavoprotein enzymes to an active intermediate which inhibits the microorganism's proteins, DNA, RNA and cell wall synthesis.  Nitrofurantoin is active against most strains of Gram positive and Gram negative urinary tract pathogens but generally less active against most strains of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and Proteus. Toxicity: Human data: Adults: Acute toxic exposures to nitrofurantoin have not been reported and there have been no acute ingestions causing fatalities. No toxic or lethal levels have been determined for nitrofurantoin. However there are a number of adverse effects and hypersensitivity reactions reported which have included fatalities.  The duration of exposure before the onset of symptoms of acute pulmonary toxicity varies from two or three days to several weeks. Teratogenicity: case of a 14 month old girl with asymmetrical paralysis limited to the upper limbs with signs suggesting an early prenatal onset was reported. Nitrofurantoin and Bendectin (R) taken during early pregnancy were suspected to be the cause. Mutagenicity: There are data demonstrating mutagenicity in human cells Interactions: Food significantly enhances the bioavailability and duration of the therapeutic concentration of nitrofurantoin. Uricosuric agents (probenecid or sulfinpyrazone) may inhibit renal excretion of nitrofurantoin and hence increase its plasma level, reduce its effectiveness, and increase its toxicity.  Antacids: specifically magnesium trisilicate were reported to decrease the rate and extent of nitrofurantoin absorption through an adsorption mechanism.  Quinolones antibacterial activity in vitro is antagonized by nitrofurantoin. It is possible that this interaction could occur in vivo as well. Drugs which acidify the urine decrease the excretion of nitrofurantoin. Main adverse effects: The most frequent adverse effects of nitrofurantoin are anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, which are dose related.  Peripheral polyneuropathy and optic neuritis are serious adverse effects of nitrofurantoin and call for immediate withdrawal of the drug. They occur especially in pre-existing renal impairment and the presence of vitamin B deficiency.  Peripheral neuropathy was reported in 10 month to 18 year old children.  Hepatic damage with nitrofurantoin is reversible on discontinuation of the drug. Hepatic reactions range from acute self-limiting hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis and necrosis associated with long term use.  Pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions to nitrofurantoin can be life threatening and nitrofurantoin should be stopped immediately on occurance of symptoms. Impaired pulmonary function may remain even after cessation of therapy. Deaths as a result of cardiopulmonary collapse and of alveolar hemorrhage have been reported.  Hematological disorders - and of special significance, hemolytic anaemia associated with use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency have been reported in association with nitrofurantoin use. Additional hematologic effects include leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia.  Dermatologic reactions include Stevens Johnson syndrome and other rashes. ANIMAL STUDIES: Carcinogenicity: Nitrofurantoin does not appear to be carcinogenic. There is increased ovarian cancer in mice with chronic, high dose administration. It was found to be carcinogenic in B6C3F female mice and in F344/N male rats. Teratogenicity: There is no evidence to link nitrofurantoin to birth defects in animals.",

Sprague-Dawley rat embryos were explanted on day 10 of gestation and grown in culture medium to which the test compounds were added. After 26 hr in culture, the embryos were removed and examined for malformations. Nitrofurantoin exposure was associated with cephalic hypoplasia at 0.2 mM concentration and was embryolethal to 100% of embryos tested at 0.25 mM concentration. Its failure to produce axial symmetry may have been masked due to an extremely steep dose-response curve for embryolethality. All the nitroheterocyclic compounds with high redox potential tested produced axial asymmetric malformations with the exception of nitrofurantoin. All the compounds with nitro groups and low single-electron redox potential tested did not produce the axial asymmetry.",

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of nitrofurantoin were conducted by admin nitrofurantoin (greater than 99% pure) in feed to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for ... Two yr studies of nitrofurantoin were conducted by feeding diets containing 0, 1,300, or 2,500 ppm nitrofurantoin to groups of 50 male F344/N rats and to groups of 50 male and female B6C3F1 mice for 103 wk. Groups of 50 female F344/N rats were fed diets containing 0, 600, or 1,300 ppm nitrofurantoin on the same schedule. Conclusions. Under the conditions of these 2 yr feed studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of nitrofurantoin for male F344/N rats as shown by increased incidences of uncommon kidney tubular cell neoplasms. Uncommon osteosarcomas of the bone and neoplasms of the subcutaneous tissue were observed in dosed male rats. Incidences of interstitial cell adenomas of the testis and neoplasms of the preputial gland were decreased in the 2,500-ppm group of male rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of nitrofurantoin for female F344/N rats fed diets containing 600 ppm or 1,300 ppm for 2 yr. Female rats may have been able to tolerate higher doses. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of nitrofurantoin for male B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 1,300 ppm or 2,500 ppm for 2 yr. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of nitrofurantoin for female B6C3F1 mice as shown by increased incidences of tubular adenomas, benign mixed tumors, and granulosa cell tumors of the ovary.",

Male & female mice were continuously exposed for a 7-day precohabitation & a 98-day cohabitation period (Task 2). Subsequently, the control & 0.12% groups were used in a cross-over mating trial (Task 3) to determine the sex affected by chemical treatment. The F1 generation from control, 0.06, & 0.12% groups were also evaluated (Task 4). Nitrofurantoin treatment, at up to 0.12% concns, had no apparent effect on parental fertility, number of litters/pair, proportion of pups born alive, sex of live pups, neonatal body weights, & postnatal survival. Nitrofurantoin at 0.12% in feed, significantly reduced dam body weight at delivery & lactation, number of live pups/litter, & pup body weights at postnatal days 7-21. The cross-over mating trial did not reveal any significant effects on mating, fertility or reproduction. Nitrofurantoin disrupted the estrual cycle in the F0 females; there was a significant incr in the % of vaginal smears showing estrus, & a decr in the % of smears indicating diestrus. All parental mice were necropsied. Female body weight was slightly reduced at 0.12%, as was epididymal sperm motility; absolute & adjusted kidney weights of both sexes were increased significantly at 0.12%. There were also testicular lesions in the 0.12% group. The F1 generation showed significant reductions in fertility & live litter size at the 0.12% dose level. Nitrofurantoin at 0.12% significantly increased F1 adjusted kidney weights (both sexes) & reduced testis, epididymis & cauda epididymis weights as well as epididymal sperm concn & motility, & produced testicular lesions. These data show that Nitrofurantoin exhibited reproductive toxicity in the presence of systemic effects.",

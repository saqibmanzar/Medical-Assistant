Pure hexane is used in laboratories. Most of the hexane used in industry is mixed with similar chemicals called solvents. The major use for solvents containing hexane is to extract vegetable oils from crops such as soybeans. These solvents are also used as cleaning agents in the printing, textile, furniture, and shoemaking industries. Certain kinds of special glues used in the roofing and shoe and leather industries also contain hexane. Several consumer products contain hexane, such as gasoline, quick-drying glues used in various hobbies, and rubber cement. (L175) ",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 319 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 2,2-dimethylbutane will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 2,2-dimethylbutane will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7 days. 2,2-Dimethylbutane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 2,2-dimethylbutane is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 2100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7 atm-cu m/mole. 2,2-Dimethylbutane may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Under aerobic conditions, 2,2-dimethylbutane was shown to degrade after a 15 day lag period when tested as a mixture of light hydrocarbons in activated sludge (14% of the initial amount remained after 34 days of incubation); however, when tested as the single carbon source little degradation was observed (86% of the initial amount remained) suggesting that biodegradation may occur via co-metabolism. If released into water, 2,2-dimethylbutane is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 57 minutes and 3.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 150 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 2,2-dimethylbutane may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 2,2-dimethylbutane is produced or used. 2,2-Dimethylbutane is widely detected in vehicle exhaust and gasoline vapors. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 2,2-dimethylbutane via inhalation of ambient air, and as a result of handling gasoline. (SRC)",

Under aerobic conditions, 2,2-dimethylbutane was shown to degrade after a 15 day lag period when tested as a mixture of light hydrocarbons in activated sludge (14% of the initial amount remained after 34 days of incubation); however, when tested as the single carbon source little degradation was observed (86% of the initial amount remained) suggesting that biodegradation may occur via co-metabolism(6).",

However, when tested as the single carbon source little degradation was observed (86% of the initial amount remained; comparable to the abiotic control where 89% remained) suggesting that its degradation may occur via co-metabolism(1). In another aerobic biodegradation study of gasoline hydrocarbons in water from a domestic sewage treatment plant, a degradation half-life for 2,2-dimethylbutane was calculated as 26.5 days(2). Under optimal conditions, biodegradation results for gasoline in activated sludge indicate that 2,2-dimethylbutane constituted a recalcitrant portion of the mixture(3).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that 2,2-dimethylbutane is expected to volatilize rapidly from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 57 minutes(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3.7 days(SRC). 2,2-Dimethylbutane's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of 2,2-dimethylbutane from dry soil surfaces may exist (SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 319 mm Hg(1).",

The average concentration of 2,2-dimethylbutane in the exhaust of 6 cars in the UK, 1988, was 1733 ppb(2). Gasoline engine exhaust (noncatalyst and catalyst equipped), and unburned gasoline (whole and headspace vapors) profiles include 2,2-dimethylbutane at concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, 0.2, and 0.3 wt%, respectively(3). Source composition profiles for exhaust from an FTP test of 46 in-use passenger vehicles for 1975-1982 model years, Vancouver gasoline, Vancouver gasoline vapor, Whatcom County gasoline and Whatcom County gasoline vapor included 2,2-dimethylbutane at 0.440, 0.218, 0.334, 0.192, 0.345% NMHC (non-methane hydrocarbons)(4). Emission rates of 2,2-dimethylbutane from light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles in the Fort McHenry tunnel(Baltimore, MD; collected June 1992) were measured as 4.5 and 15.9 mg/vehicle-mile, respectively; air concentrations at the east portal ranged from 1.9 to 67.8 ppbC. Emission rates of 2,2-dimethylbutane from light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles in the Tuscarora tunnel (Pennsylvania; collected September 1992) were measured as 2.3 and 12.1 mg/vehicle-mile, respectively; air concentrations ranged from 9.4 to 2.1 ppbC (5). 2,2-Dimethylbutane was emitted from the tailpipe of automobiles at a rate of 800 ug 2,2-dimethylbutane per kilometer (vehicles equipped with catalytic converters) and 195,000 ug 2,2-dimethylbutane per kilometer (vehicles without catalytic converters)(6). Vehicle emissions were analyzed in the Maria Maluf Tunnel in Sao Paulo, Brazil in May 2004. Average emission factors for 2,2-dimethylbutane were reported; May 5 morning, 10.2 mg/kg; May 5 evening, 16.4 mg/kg; May 6 morning, 122.9 mg/kg; May 6 evening, 26.2 mg/kg(7).",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Enrolled in this study were 20 patients with advanced solid tumors for whom no other therapy was available, had life expectancy greater than 12 weeks, and normal organ function.

Blood was sampled for pharmacokinetic analysis prior to dosing and at 15 and 30 min and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 hr thereafter. The patients entered comprised 15 men and 5 women with a median age of 61 years (range 30-74 years). Prior therapy regimens included: chemotherapy (median two prior regimens, range none to five), radiation therapy (one), no prior therapy (one). There was no dose-limiting toxicity. Escalation was halted at the 200 mg/kg three times daily level due to the number of capsules required. A median butyrate concentration of 52 microM was obtained but there was considerable interpatient variability. No objective responses were seen. There were four patients with prolonged disease stabilization ranging from 3 to 23 months; median progression-free survival was 55 days. Two patients with chemotherapy-refractory non-small-cell lung cancer had survived for >1 year at the time of this report without evidence of progression.",

                                            "String": "... Female CD2F1 mice were treated with tributyrin by oral gavage or with sodium butyrate by i.v. bolus or oral gavage. Oral tributyrin doses delivered to mice were 3.1, 5.2, 7.8, and 10.3 g/kg. Intravenous sodium butyrate doses were 0.31, 0.62, 0.94, and 1.25 g/kg. Oral sodium butyrate was given to mice at 5 g/kg. Subsequently, similar studies were performed in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were given tributyrin by oral gavage at doses of 3.6, 5.2, or 10.3 g/kg or sodium butyrate i.v. at a dose of 500 mg/kg. Plasma butyrate concentrations were determined by gas chromatography. RESULTS: In mice, oral dosing with tributyrin resulted in detectable plasma butyrate concentrations as early as at 5 min after treatment and produced peak plasma butyrate concentrations at between 15 and 60 min after dosing. Peak plasma butyrate concentrations increased proportionally with increasing tributyrin dose, but as the oral tributyrin dose increased there was a greater than proportional increase in the area under the curve of plasma butyrate concentrations versus time (AUC). At a tributyrin dose of 10.3 g/kg, plasma butyrate concentrations peaked at approximately 1.75 mM and remained >1 mM for between 10 and 60 min after dosing. However, approximately 10% of mice treated with this dose died acutely. At a tributyrin dose of 7.8 g/kg, plasma butyrate concentrations reached approximately 1 mM by 15 min after dosing and remained between 0.8 and 1 mM until 60 min after dosing. No mouse treated with this dose died acutely. Mice given tributyrin doses of 5.2 and 3.1 g/kg achieved peak plasma butyrate concentrations of approximately 0.9 and 0.5 mM, respectively, by 45 min after dosing. Plasma butyrate concentrations in these mice remained above 0.1 mM until 120 and 90 min after dosing, respectively. The four i.v. doses of sodium butyrate resulted in plasma concentration-time profiles that also indicated nonlinear pharmacokinetics and were well described by a one-compartment model with saturable elimination. Values recorded for the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and the maximal velocity of the process (Vmax) ranged between 1.02 and 5.65 mM and 0.60 and 1.82 mmol/min, respectively. Values noted for the volume of the central compartment (Vc) varied between 0.48 and 0.72 l/kg. At 1.25 g/kg, i.v. sodium butyrate produced peak plasma butyrate concentrations of 10.5-17.7 mM, and plasma butyrate concentrations remained above 1 mM for 20-30 min. Sodium butyrate delivered orally to mice at 5 g/kg produced peak plasma butyrate concentrations of approximately 9 mM at 15 min after dosing and plasma butyrate concentrations exceeding 1 mM for 90 min after dosing. In rats the 10.3-g/kg oral dose of tributyrin produced peak plasma butyrate concentrations of approximately 3 mM by 75 min after dosing and butyrate concentrations exceeding 1 mM from 30 to 90 min after dosing. The plasma butyrate concentrations produced in rats by 5.2- and 3.6-g/kg doses were appropriately lower than those produced by the 10.3-g/kg dose, and there was no evidence of nonlinearity. The 500-mg/kg i.v. dose of sodium butyrate produced peak plasma butyrate concentrations in rats of approximately 11 mM, and the decline in plasma butyrate concentrations with time after dosing was consistent with saturable clearance.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

MTT /2H-Tetrazolium,2-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-3)/ assay was applied to detect the cell proliferation. [(3)H]-TdR uptake was measured to determine DNA synthesis. Apoptotic morphology was observed by electron microscopy and Hoechst-33258 staining. Flow cytometry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed to detect tributyrin-triggered apoptosis. The expressions of PARP /Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase/, Bcl-2 and Bax were examined by Western blot assay. Tributyrin could initiate growth inhibition of SGC-7901 cell in a dose- and time-dependent manner. [(3)H]-TdR uptake by SGC-7901 cells was reduced to 33.6 % after 48 h treatment with 2 mmol/L(-1) tributyrin, compared with the control (P<0.05). Apoptotic morphology was detected by TUNEL assay. Flow cytometry revealed that tributyrin could induce apoptosis of SGC-7901 cells in dose-dependent manner. After 48 hours incubation with tributyrin at 2 mmol/L(-1), the level of Bcl-2 protein was lowered, and the level of Bax protein was increased in SGC-7901, accompanied by PARP cleavage.",

Transient increased mitochondria-associated bax, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta(psi)m), and caspase-3-independent cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase are evident as early as 4 h after treatment of cells with tributyrin. These events are followed by the transient accumulation of mitochondrial cytochrome c in the cytosol and, finally, the generation and accumulation of cells with subdiploid DNA content. During the period in which mitochondria-associated bax levels are elevated, the delta(psi)m is disrupted, and cytochrome c is detected in the cytosol, we show induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 in the absence of increased p53 and arrest of cells in G2-M.",

Tributyrin administration caused hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia similar to the ketotic condition in less than 3 hr and was a negative correlation of --.88 between glucose and ketone concentrations in blood plasma. Administration of either magnesium propionate, sodium propionate, or 1,2-propanediol could counteract the hypoglycemia and hyperketonemia induced by tributyrin administration without significantly changing the insulin response.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.0013 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates tributyrin will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase tributyrin will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.2 days. Tributyrin does not contain chromophores expected to absorb light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore would not be expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, tributyrin is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 570. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.6X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. Tributyrin is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, tributyrin is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Tributyrin is biodegraded by activated sludge with a measured oxygen uptake of 300 mg/L in 7 days, indicating that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 50 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis under environmental conditions is expected although the estimated rate of this reaction in slow. The estimated half-lives of this reaction are 250 days and 25 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to tributyrin may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where tributyrin is produced or used. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Bone marrow suppression, notably thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which may contribute to bleeding and overwhelming infections in an already compromised patient, is the most common and severe of the toxic effects of CeeNU.  Since the major toxicity is delayed bone marrow suppression, blood counts should be monitored weekly for at least 6 weeks after a dose. At the recommended dosage, courses of CeeNU should not be given more frequently than every 6 weeks.  The bone marrow toxicity of CeeNU is cumulative and therefore dosage adjustment must be considered on the basis of nadir blood counts from prior dose",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

If hazardous drugs are being prepared or administered in a nonroutine area (home setting or unusual patient-care area), a spill kit should be obtained by the drug handler. The kit should include two pairs of disposable gloves (one outer pair of utility gloves and one inner latex pair); low-permeability, disposable protective garments (coveralls or gown and shoe covers); safety glasses or splash goggles; respirator; absorbent, plastic-backed sheets or spill pads; disposable toweling; at least 2 sealable thick plastic hazardous waste disposal bags (prelabeled with an appropriate warning label); a disposable scoop for collecting glass fragments; and a puncture-resistant container for glass fragments. All individuals who routinely handle hazardous drugs must be trained in proper spill management and cleanup procedures. Spills and breakages must be cleaned up immediately according to the following procedures. If the spill is not located in a confined space, the spill area should be identified and other people should be prevented from approaching and spreading the contamination. Wearing protective apparel from the spill kit, workers should remove any broken glass fragments and place them in the puncture-resistant container. Liquids should be absorbed with a spill pad; powder should be removed with damp disposable gauze pads or soft toweling. The hazardous material should be completely removed and the area rinsed with water and then cleaned with detergent. The spill cleanup should proceed progressively from areas of lesser to greater contamination. The detergent should be thoroughly rinsed and removed. All contaminated materials should be placed in the disposal bags provided and sealed and transported to a designated containment receptacle. Spills occurring in the biohazard cabinet should be cleaned up immediately; a spill kit should be used if the volume exceeds 150 ml or the contents of one drug vial or ampule. If there is broken glass, utility gloves should be worn to remove it and place it in the puncture-resistant container located in the biohazard cabinet. The biological safety cabinet, including the drain spillage trough, should be thoroughly cleaned. If the spill is not easily and thoroughly contained, the biological safety cabinet should be decontaminated after cleanup. If the spill contaminates the high efficiency particulate air filter, use of the biological safety cabinet should be suspended until the cabinet has been decontaminated and the high efficiency particulate air filter replaced. /Antineoplastic agents/",

A method should be present for identifying to personnel those drugs that require special precautions (eg, cytotoxics). One way to accomplish this is to apply appropriate warning labels to all hazardous drug containers, shelves, and bins where the drug products are stored. ... 3. A method of identifying, for patients and family members, those drugs that require special precautions in the home should be in place. This may be accomplished in the health-care setting, by providing specific labeling for discharge medications, along with written instructions. 4. Methods for identifying shipping cartons of hazardous drugs should be required from manufacturers and distributors of these drugs. 5. Written procedures for handling damaged packages of hazardous drugs should be maintained. Personnel involved in shipping and receiving hazardous drugs should be trained in these procedures, including the proper use of protective garments and equipment. Damaged shipping cartons of hazardous drugs should be received and opened in an isolated area (eg, in a laboratory fume hood, if available, not in a vertical laminar airflow biological safety cabinet used for preparing sterile products). /Antineoplastic agents/"

The abnormalities are generally transient, do not cause symptoms and do not require dose modification. Clinically apparent liver injury from lomustine has been described, but is uncommon. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations were described as cholestatic and onset was after 3 to 4 months of therapy, but otherwise its clinical characteristics have not been clearly characterized. Lomustine is often given in combination with other antineoplastic agents, many of which are also hepatotoxic, so the effect of lomustine in causing liver injury is often difficult to assess. Lomustine has not been associated specifically with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, but it is not generally given in high doses or used for myeloablation in preparation for bone marrow transplantation, the situations in which this syndrome generally occurs.",

All the experiments were carried out with 20 ug/mL bleomycin for a given treatment time. By adding 0.7 and 3.5 ug/mL chloroethylnitrosourea at late G1-S phase we have demonstrated a considerable increase in both percent of aberrant cells and production of dicentrics and rings (5-fold, p < 0.001). At late S-G2 the combined treatment led to a significant enhancement of breaks per cell (p < 0.0001) and cells with more than 12 aberrations. A possible explanation could be the known repair inhibitory potential of chloroethylnitrosourea, but its pure clastogenic action still has to be considered. The results presented here point out the need for seeking chemotherapeutic regimens with reduced concentrations of the drugs in combination.",

The anterior visual system was included in the radiation field in all patients. Radiotherapy was given for a frontal lobe glioblastoma multiforme, for central nervous system prophylaxis in a patient with oat cell carcinoma of the lung, and for a parietal lobe glioblastoma multiforme. None of the neoplasms involved the anterior visual system. The radiation dose ranged from 3000 to 4650 rad and the oral CCNU dosage from 300 mg to 1050 mg. Patients 1 and 2 also received other chemotherapeutic agents. Patient 3 who was treated only with oral CCNU and cranial irradiation died. At autopsy the brain showed a widely infiltrating residual high grade glioma as well as patchy coagulative necrosis with swollen axons and dystrophic calcifications. The optic chiasm showed severe demyelination, axonal loss, and hyalinized vessels. Synergism between oral CCNU and radiation may account for the blindness produced.",

Gastric lavage is not necessary after small to moderate ingestions if activated charcoal can be given promptly.

Alkaline phosphatases and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (threefold increase) were noted for the two doses and were greater for the highest dose. Histological and ultrastructural studies disclosed hepatic lesions of two types: during the first phase of transaminase increase, inflammation of the portal tracts; during the second phase marked dilation of bile canaliculi and numerous filamentous bundles distributed at random throughout the liver cell cytoplasm like normal microtubules. Thus, CCNU induced pericholangitis and intrahepatic cholestasis with microtubular abnormalities. The long term evolution of hepatic alterations revealed that in the 3rd month after a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg CCNU, lesions were persistent but stable; no reversibility was observed in the 3rd month after 50 mg/kg CCNU, and evolution towards cholangiolysis and biliary cirrhosis was noted. CCNU causes a bimodal hepatotoxicity in rats: an early and prolonged ductal injury and a delayed anti-liver cell microtubule toxicity.",

The portal vein was perfused with 1.0% glutaraldehyde fixative. Portal areas and the common bile duct were selectively dissected and processed using standard methods for light and transmission electron microscopy. The epithelial cells of larger common bile duct and interlobular bile ducts showed increased rough endoplasmic reticulum, markedly increased free ribosomes, and mitochondrial degeneration at 6 and 12 hr after CCNU. There was also bile imbibition and loss of microvilli, which increased in severity at 12 and 24 hr. The interstitium showed infiltration by acute inflammatory cells and dilated capillaries at 6 hr. By 24 hr, degeneration of epithelial cells was extensive; cells became necrotic and sloughed into the duct lumen. The smaller bile ductules showed no significant degenerative changes; adjacent hepatocytes were unremarkable. Early CCNU injury appears localized in the large bile ducts and reflects inflammatory edema, bile stasis, and degeneration of epithelial cells. This ductal injury may reflect metabolism of CCNU to reactive species within the bile ducts.",

A single oral dose (100 mg/kg) of CCNU caused four- and ninefold increases in SGOT and SGPT respectively 48 hr after administration in rats. A 25 fold rise in serum bilirubin, a total loss of bile flow, and a decrease in BSP clearance were also observed. Cytochrome p450 content and EM-N-demethylase activity were significantly decreased to 88% and 66% of control values respectively. A histopathological time course study of CCNU-induced injury showed a progression of acute inflammation, edema, and fibrin deposition in portal areas over 24 hr with necrosis and sloughing of bile duct epithelium at 24 and 36 hr. Treatment of rats with phenobarbital (40 mg/kg/day for 4 days, ip) 24 hr prior to CCNU administration protected against CCNU-induced hepatotoxicity. Thus, the levels of serum SGOT, SGPT, and bilirubin were only 2.5 and 4 times higher than in untreated or phenobarbital treated controls. Histopathological examination also showed reduced severity of bile duct lesions in phenobarbital pretreated animals. In rats receiving both phenobarbital and CCNU, bile flow was restored and BSP clearance was increased compared to the CCNU-treated rats. The mixed function oxidase activity in phenobarbital + CCNU-treated rats was not significantly different from that in phenobarbital treated controls. It is concluded that pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital can markedly suppress the hepatotoxic manifestations, including histopathological changes, the rise in serum bilirubin, and the cholestasis observed in CCNU-treated rats.",

Neutropenia was particularly severe in dogs, and doses of 5 mg/kg bw or above were lethal. Monkeys survived hematopoietic toxicity, but chronic interstitial nephritis developed in several animals treated with 20 or 30 mg/kg bw, and they died 16 days or more after treatment. Monkeys treated with an iv dose of 10 mg/kg bw exhibited nephritis 100 days after treatment. Transient hepatotoxicity developed in dogs 20-30 days after administration of doses exceeding 2.5 mg/kg bw. It was concluded that the highest nontoxic dose was 0.625 mg/kg bw for dogs and 1.25 mg/kg bw for monkeys. IV treatment caused toxicity that was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that with oral treatment. CCNU also has cardiopulmonary toxicity in dogs and gastrointestinal toxicity in dogs and monkeys.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.6X10-5 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates lomustine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase lomustine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 18 hours. Particulate-phase lomustine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Lomustine does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, lomustine is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 200. However, by analogy to N-nitroso-N-ethylurea which exhibited a hydrolysis half-life of 47 minutes at pH 9, adsorption may be precluded by hydrolysis. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, lomustine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 34 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Lomustine is an alkylating agent that may hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to lomustine may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where lomustine is produced or used. Exposure to lomustine among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug, an antineoplastic. (SRC)",

However, by analogy to N-nitroso-N-ethylurea which exhibited a hydrolysis half-life of 47 minutes at pH 9(3), adsorption may be precluded by hydrolysis(SRC). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-10 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(5). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 34(SRC), from its log Kow of 2.83(7) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Lomustine is an alkylating agent that may hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2009).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

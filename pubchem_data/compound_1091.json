PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

Selenium (Se) has been demonstrated to prevent cancer in numerous animal models when administered selenium at levels exceeding the nutritional requirements. One study showed efficacy in the prevention of malignancy while utilizing a selenium supplement in humans. The reports from such studies have heightened the interest in additional human selenium supplementation studies to validate the results in larger populations.  Interestingly, selenium is being studied as a potential therapy in the prevention or management of atherosclerosis.",

Selenium is a nonmetal element with the atomic number 34 and the chemical symbol Se. Selenium rarely occurs in its elemental state in nature and is usually found in sulfide ores such as pyrite, partially replacing the sulfur in the ore matrix. It may also be found in silver, copper, lead, and nickel minerals. Though selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, trace amounts of the element are necessary for cellular function in most animals, forming the active center of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and three known deiodinase enzymes.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Selenium is needed to maintain the circulatory system. It also keeps the heart muscle and skin tissue healthy. It may also help in the prevention of cancer due to its stimulation of antioxidant activity and protection of cell membranes,.  Selenious acid preserves vitamin E, which improves the cell's antioxidant defense, and plays an important role in the structure of teeth.  Prolonged TPN (total parenteral nutrition) support in humans has resulted in selenium deficiency symptoms which include muscle pain and tenderness. The symptoms have been reported to respond to supplementation of TPN solutions with selenium [DB11135],.  Pediatric conditions, Keshan disease, and Kwashiorkor have been associated with low dietary intake of selenium. The conditions are endemic to geographical areas marked by low selenium content in the soil. Dietary supplementation with selenium salts has been reported to reduce the incidence of the conditions among affected children.",

In vivo, selenium compounds are generally metabolized to reduced states. For example, quadrivalent selenium (Se+4) in selenite often undergoes reduction to Se\u22122, metabolized firstly to H2Se and, finally, being methylated to various excretory forms. Selenious acid to oxidize sulfurous acid: H2SeO3 + 2H2SO3 \u2192 Se0 + 2H2SO4 + H2O.  Se may also produce reactive oxygen species and, thereby, exert cancer-selective cytotoxicity. Selenodiglutathione (SDG) is a primary Se metabolite conjugated to two glutathione (GSH) moieties. Selenodiglutathione increases intracellular selenium accumulation and is significantly more toxic than selenous acid (H2SeO3)..   The liver is the central organ for selenium regulation and produces excretory selenium forms to regulate whole-body selenium.",

Once in the body, selenium is distributed mainly to the liver and kidney. Selenium is an essential micronutrient and is a component of glutathione peroxidase, iodothyronine 5'-deiodinases, and thioredoxin reductase. Organic selenium is first metabolized into inorganic selenium. Inorganic selenium is reduced stepwise to the intermediate hydrogen selenide, which is either incorporated into selenoproteins after being transformed to selenophosphate and selenocysteinyl tRNA or excreted into the urine after being transformed into methylated metabolites of selenide. Elemental selenium is also methylated before excretion. Selenium is primarily eliminated in the urine and feces, but certain selenium compounds may also be exhaled. (L619)",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The most important physiological role of sodium selenite is associated with its presence as an active component of many enzymes and proteins, in addition to its antioxidative role. Selenium has been shown to activate anticancer agents, prevent heart and vascular diseases, exhibit anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory properties, and to stimulate the immune system.  Its anticancer properties may be explained by the oxidation of free sulfhydryl groups. Tumor cells express free sulfhydryl groups (\u2013SH) on the surface of their cell membranes and contribute to uncontrolled cell division. Only those compounds that can oxidize these groups to disulfides (S\u2013S) may inhibit this process. Some organic forms of selenium, including selenocysteine, methylseleninic acid, and Se-methylselenocysteine have been established to be antioxidants. However, their anticancer mechanism is still not well understood.  Selenious acid, during an in vitro study, was found to stimulate hemoglobin synthesis in three different malignant erythroleukemia cell lines (MEL). It has also been shown to increase the release of interleukin 2 in a dose-dependent manner. Interleukin-2 is made by a type of T lymphocyte (white blood cell). It increases the growth and activity of other T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes and this contributes to the development of the immune system.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Inactivation of the sulfhydryl enzymes necessary for oxidative reactions in cellular respiration, through effects on mitochondrial and microsomal electron transport, might contribute to acute selenium toxicity. Selenomethionine (a common organic selenium compound) also appears to randomly substitute for methionine in protein synthesis. This substitution may affect the structure and functionability of the protein, for example, by altering disulfide bridges. Inorganic forms of selenium appear to react with tissue thiols by redox catalysis, resulting in formation of reactive oxygen species and causing damage by oxidative stress. (L619)",

Each agent was added to the diet of a final concentration of 3 ppm selenium. In general, there was no significant difference in the potency of these five selenium compounds in inhibiting the development of mammary tumors. The interaction of vitamin E (500 ppm) with either selenite or selenomethionine was further characterized in a second carcinogenesis study. Results of this experiment suggested that vitamin E enhanced the protective effect of selenite but not that of selenomethionine. In an attempt to explore the synergistic mechanism of selenium and vitamin E, the effects of these two agents on mitogen induced blastogenesis and natural killer cytotoxic activity were also investigated. No consistent changes in these in vitro immune functions were detected resulting from supranutritional feeding of either selenite or vitamin E or both. ... /Selenite/",

Control Sprague Dawley rats were fed a purified 55 corn oil diet containing 0.1 ppm selenium. Selenite or seleno-DL-methionine was added to the basal diet in concentrations of 2, 3, or 4 ppm starting 1 week after DMBA administration. The inhibitory response in mammary tumorigenesis with selenium supplementation was dose dependent. Both selenium compounds were found to be equally efficacious in prophylaxis, although at the 4 ppm level a slight reduction in growth was observed. /Selenite/",

Concentrations of 10(-6) to 10(-2) M cadmium and mercury were injurious to spermatozoa as indicated by depressed motility and reduced oxygen uptake. Equimolar concentrations of selenium as selenite, selenocystine, or selenomethioine counteracted the toxicity of cadmium and mercury at low concentrations (10(-5) and 10(-6) M) but not at higher concentrations (10(-4) to 10(-2) M). ... /Selenite/",

Initial Medical Examination: A complete history and physical examination: The purpose is to detect existing conditions that might place the exposed employee at increased risk, and to establish a baseline for future health monitoring. Persons with a history of asthma, allergies, or known sensitization to selenium, or with a history of other chronic respiratory disease, gastrointestinal disturbances, disorders of liver or kidneys or recurrent dermatitis would be expected to be at increased risk from exposure. Examination of the eyes, respiratory system, liver, kidneys, and blood should be stressed. The skin should be examined for evidence of chronic disorders. Special consideration should be given to women of childbearing age since the possibility that selenium may be teratogenic might place these women in a high risk group. Urinalysis: Proper function of the kidneys is necessary to validate levels of selenium in the urine. A urinalysis should be obtained to include at a minimum specific gravity, albumin, glucose, and a microscopic /examination of/ centrifuged sediment. Liver function tests: Selenium causes liver damage and tumors in animals. A profile of liver function should be obtained by using a medically acceptable array of biochemical tests. The aforementioned medical examinations should be repeated on an annual basis. /Selenium and its inorganic compounds/",

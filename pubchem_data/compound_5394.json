Despite considerable genetic heterogeneity, these tumours often have impaired DNA repair systems, rendering them initially sensitive to alkylating agents, although they invariably develop resistance to these agents over time. Temozolomide is an imidazotetrazine prodrug that is stable at acidic pH but undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic hydrolysis at neutral or slightly basic pH; these properties allow for both oral and intravenous administration. Following initial hydrolysis, further reactions liberate a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation capable of methylating various residues on adenosine and guanine bases leading to DNA lesions and eventual apoptosis. Temozomolide as an adjunct to radiotherapy followed by maintenance dosing remains the standard of care for both Glioblastoma and refractory anaplastic astrocytoma.  Temozolomide was granted FDA approval on August 11, 1999, as an oral capsule and subsequently on February 27, 2009, as an intravenous injection. It is currently marketed under the trademark TEMODAR\u00ae by Merck.",

Unlike dacarbazine, which is metabolized to MITC only in the liver, temozolomide is metabolized to MITC at all sites. Temozolomide is administered orally and penetrates well into the central nervous system. (NCI04)",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Temozolomide treatment is associated with myelosuppression, which is likely to be more severe in females and geriatric patients. Patients must have an ANC of \u22651.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and a platelet count of \u2265100 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L before starting therapy and must be monitored weekly during the concomitant radiotherapy phase, on days one and 22 of maintenance cycles, and weekly at any point where the ANC/platelet count falls below the specified values until recovery. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed following temozolomide administration. Pneumocystis pneumonia may occur in patients undergoing treatment, and prophylaxis should be provided for patients in the concomitant phase of therapy with monitoring at all stages. Severe hepatotoxicity has also been reported, and liver testing should be performed at baseline, midway through the first cycle, before each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose. Animal studies suggest that temozolomide has significant embryo-fetal toxicity; male and female patients should practice contraception up to three and six months following the last dose of temozolomide, respectively.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Therefore, temozolomide may be administered both orally and intravenously with a median Tmax of one hour. Following a single oral dose of 150 mg/m2, temozolomide and its active MTIC metabolite had Cmax values of 7.5 \u03bcg/mL and 282 ng/mL and AUC values of 23.4 \u03bcg\\*hr/mL and 864 ng\\*hr/mL, respectively. Similarly, following a single 90-minute IV infusion of 150 mg/m2, temozolide and its active MTIC metabolite had Cmax values of 7.3 \u03bcg/mL and 276 ng/mL and AUC values of 24.6 \u03bcg\\*hr/mL and 891 ng\\*hr/mL, respectively. Temozolomide kinetics are linear over the range of 75-250 mg/m2/day. The median Tmax is 1 hour  Oral temozolomide absorption is affected by food. Administration following a high-fat breakfast of 587 calories caused the mean Cmax and AUC to decrease by 32% and 9%, respectively, and the median Tmax to increase by 2-fold (from 1-2.25 hours).",

Primarily defined histopathologically by necrosis and microvascular proliferation (WHO grade IV classification), glioblastomas are commonly treated through radiotherapy and concomitant alkylation-based chemotherapy with temozolomide. Temozolomide (TMZ) is a small (194 Da) lipophilic alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine class that is stable at acidic pH, allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing, and can cross the blood-brain barrier to affect CNS tumours. After absorption, TMZ undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic breakdown at physiological pH to form 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), which then reacts with water to produce 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) and a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation. Brain tumours such as glioblastoma typically possess a more alkaline pH than healthy tissue, favouring TMZ activation within tumour tissue.  The methyl diazonium cation is highly reactive and methylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine (N7-MeG, 70%), the N3 position of adenine (N3-MeA, 9%), and the O6 position of guanine (O6-MeG, 6%). Although more prevalent, N7-MeG and N3-MeA are rapidly repaired by the base excision repair pathway and are not primary mediators of temozolomide toxicity, although N3-MeA lesions are lethal if not repaired. By comparison, repair of O6-MeG requires action by the suicide enzyme methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes the methyl group to restore guanine. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis. As MMR activity is crucial for temozolomide cytotoxicity, cells that have reduced or absent MGMT function and an intact MMR pathway are the most sensitive to temozolomide treatment. Glioblastomas that upregulate MGMT downregulate MMR or alter both are resistant to TMZ, leading to treatment failure.  More recently, increased interest has also been shown in the immunomodulatory effects of TMZ, related to its myelosuppressive effects. Counterintuitively, lymphodepletion may enhance the antitumour effects of cellular immunotherapy and improve the dynamics of memory cells by altering tumour-specific versus tumour-tolerant populations. The depletion of tumour-localized immunosuppressive T<sub>reg</sub> cells may contribute to an improved response to immunotherapy. Hence, TMZ treatment may also form the backbone of immunotherapy strategies against glioblastoma in the future.",

An instance of serum aminotransferase elevation with jaundice was reported in the registration trials of temozolomide and subsequent to its approval. More strikingly, multiple single case reports and several case series of temozolomide hepatotoxicity have been reported in the literature. The onset of injury was typically within 2 to 8 weeks of starting temozolomide but several patients had received multiple courses before the onset of liver injury. The pattern of serum enzyme elevations was usually mixed initially, but the disease tended to be cholestatic. In several instances, jaundice was deep and prolonged. Features of hypersensitivity (rash, fever, eosinophilia) and autoantibody formation were not present. Liver histology demonstrated cholestasis and bile duct injury and a striking decrease in bile ducts (bile duct loss or paucity). Jaundice and pruritus tended to be prolonged and some patients developed vanishing bile duct syndrome, while others recovered clinically but had persistent serum alkaline phosphatase elevations during follow up and to the time of death from the brain tumor. Rechallenge was not done, but several patients subsequently received other antineoplastic agents, some of which were alkylating agents without recurrence of liver injury.",

Most patients had not received corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents that are more traditionally associated with reactivation. The episodes are marked by rises in HBV DNA levels and mild jaundice and responded to prompt antiviral therapy for hepatitis B which allowed for restarting of temozolomide in some cases. Fatal cases of reactivation have not been reported, but in general hepatitis B reactivation with jaundice has a mortality rate in excess of 10%.",

The microbial population and metabolic profile of her milk were compared to those of 8 healthy women who were not receiving chemotherapy. The breastmilk microbial population in the patient was markedly different from that of the healthy women, with increases in Acinetobacter sp., Xanthomonadacae and Stenotrophomonas sp. and decreases in Bifidobacterium sp. and Eubacterium sp. Marked differences were also found among numerous chemical components in the breastmilk of the treated woman, most notably DHA and inositol were decreased.",

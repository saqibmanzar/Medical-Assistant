When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to the atmosphere, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid will exist in both the vapor phase and in the particulate phase based on an estimated vapor pressure of 3.33X10-7 mm Hg. In the vapor phase, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid will react fairly rapidly with hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of 2 days. Particulate phase 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid may be removed physically from air by wet and dry deposition. Based on an estimated Koc of 3, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid should have very high mobility in soil and as this compound is miscible in water, leaching may occur. In moist soils, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid is expected to dissociate. 4-Hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid should biodegrade under aerobic conditions; using a soil inoculum, this compound required 32 days for complete biodegradation. In water, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid is expected to dissociate. Biodegradation will occur slowly. Using an unacclimated activated sludge inoculum, a period of 190-195 hours was required for complete biodegradation. This time period included a 76-95 hour lag time suggesting that an initial acclimatization period prior to biodegradation of this compound is necessary. Other studies using higher concentrations of 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid, a shorter time period (1 hour to 70 hours), and microorganisms acclimated to either benzene or benzenesulfonic acid showed no biodegradation of 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid. This compound is not expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms or to volatilize from water surfaces. (SRC)",

As this compound is miscible in water(4), leaching may be an important fate process(SRC). In moist soils 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid should quickly dissociate(5,SRC). Biodegradation of this compound may be an important fate process; 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid at 75 ug/l showed complete degradation within 32 days using a soil inoculum(6). 4-Hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid at 100 mg/l was biodegraded by an activated sludge inoculum over 14 days(7). A long lag period of 76-95 hours was measured with complete biodegradation requiring a total of 190 to 195 hours; these results suggested that 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid is biodegraded completely over a long time by acclimatized microorganisms(7). Other aerobic biodegradation experiments using higher concentrations of 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid (500 mg/l) and shorter incubation times (70 hours) determined that 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid was not biodegraded under these conditions(8,9). Under anaerobic conditions, using an aquifer slurry as an inoculum, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid at 35 mg/l was not biodegraded over a period of 13 months(10). 4-Hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid will not volatilize from moist soil surfaces(SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.62X10-13 atm-cu/mole(11).",

Aerobic biodegradation is expected to be a major fate process for 4- hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid. 4-Hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid at 100 mg/l was incubated over 14 days with a non-acclimatized activated sludge inoculum. Complete biodegradation required 190-195 hours including a 76-95 hour lag time; this indicates that an initial acclimatization period prior to biodegradation of this compound is necessary(2). When inoculated with an activated sludge culture which was acclimatized to benzene, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid, at a concentration of 500 mg/l, was not biodegraded within the time period of 70 hours(3). A pure culture of Pseudomonas H-8, a known benzene sulfonate oxidizer isolated from pond water, was unable to biodegrade 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid over an unreported period of time(4). 4-Hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid at 35 mg/l was not biodegraded under anaerobic conditions for a 13 month period using an aquifer slurry as an inoculum(5). An estimated BCF value of 0 indicates that 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid will not bioconcentrate in an aquatic system(6,7,SRC). 4-Hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces(SRC) based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.62X10-13 atm-cu/mole (8).",

An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The degradation ratio of 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid (at 100 mg/l), defined as the BOD/Theoretical BOD, was determined to be 0.76 to 0.78; a lag time of 76-95 hours was measured, total biodegradation of this compound required 190-195 hours including the lag period(2).

The biodegradability of 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid was measured under anaerobic conditions using two aquifer slurries, one from a sulfate reducing site, the other from a methanogenic site. 4-Hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid was added at a concentration of 200 uM to a slurry from each site and monitored from 0 to 13 months. Under sulfate reducing conditions, 4-hydroxyphenylsulfonic acid was present at 188 uM and at 198 uM after 0 to 13 months respectively.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

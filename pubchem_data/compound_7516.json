Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Phenyldiazene, presumably produced by 2-electron oxidation of phenylhydrazine by oxyhemoglobin, hemolyzed red cells rapidly and converted oxyhemoglobin into methemoglobin, hemichromes, and other hemoglobin breakdown products. Induction of hemolysis by phenyldiazene requires the presence of oxygen. The hemolysis produced in presence of phenyldiazene and oxygen was related to lipid peroxidation. It is concluded that the active hemolytic agent produced by phenylhydrazine in red cells is a phenyldiazene-derived free radical produced by reaction of phenyldiazene with oxygen, and is most probably the phenyl free radical.",

Cytochrome p450 preferentially oxidized the nitrogen to nitrogen bond of 1,2-disubstituted hydrazines and hydrazides, while monoamine oxidase oxidized the nitrogen to nitrogen bond of all the classes of hydrazine derivatives that were tested. Oxidation of the nitrogen to nitrogen bond led to the formation of stable azo intemediates in the case of 1,2-disubstituted hydrazines and to unstable monoazo (diazene) metabolites in the case of monosubstituted hydrazines and hydrazides. /Substituted hydrazines/",

Autoradiography showed that most brush border iron uptake occurred at the upper villus region and the maximal rate was increased fourfold by phenylhydrazine; Duodenal villus length was increased in phenylhydrazine-treated rats. Phenylhydrazine treatment did not influence mucosal reducing activity but Vm, measured using duodenal sheets, increased from -50 to -57 mV (p<0.001) and this was due to a reduced brush border sodium permeability. Thus, an expanded absorptive surface and an enhanced electrical driving force for iron uptake across the duodenal brush border are important adaptations for increased iron absorption in phenylhydrazine-induced hemolytic anemia.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL).

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

This chemical is used world wide mainly as a chemical intermediate in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and chemical industries. HUMAN EXPOSURE: The number of persons potentially exposed to phenylhydrazine or its hydrochloride salt is unknown, but is expected to be small. No personal exposure data were available. There is evidence that phenylhydrazine has skin sensitizing properties in humans. There are no adequate data available regarding the reproductive or developmental effects, hence, it is not possible to evaluate the risk to human health for these endpoints. The level of risk in occupational settings is uncertain; as a result, there is a continuing requirement to reduce exposure levels with the technology currently available. The lack of available data to serve as a basis for estimation of indirect exposure of individuals to phenylhydrazine from the general environment precludes the characterization of potential cancer risks for the general population. ANIMAL/PLANT STUDIES: The limited data on the toxicokinetics indicate that phenylhydrazine is well absorbed by inhalation, oral and dermal routes and binds readily with hemoglobin in red blood cells. Metabolism seems to occur via ring hydroxylation and conjugation, probably with glucuronic acid. Excretion is primarily via the urine. Phenylhydrazine is toxic by single exposure via the oral route (LD50 80-188 mg/kg body weight) and is expected to be toxic by inhalation and dermal routes (data from these routes are less clear). Phenylhydrazine has potential for skin and eye irritation. Exposure to this chemical may cause damage to red blood cells, potentially resulting in anemia and consequential secondary involvement of other tissues such as the spleen and liver. Phenylhydrazine is mutagenic in vitro, and there is some evidence to indicate that it may express genotoxic activity in vivo. The substance is clearly carcinogenic in mice following oral dosing, inducing tumors of the vascular system. Phenylhydrazine is readily biodegradable. Phenylhydrazine is toxic to aquatic organisms, with the lowest reported no observed effect concentration (NOEC) in standard acute fish tests at 0.01 mg/l; fish are generally more sensitive than either daphnids or bacteria. A NOEC of 0.49 ug/l has been reported for embryo larval stages of the zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio).",

Male (C3H/C57Bl)F1 mice received sc 1 mg PHCL in 0.1 mL water for 3 days. Controls received injections of water. Mice were injected ip with (59)iron as citrate 1 to 10 days after 3rd PHCL injection. Some mice were exposed to 800 roentgens at various intervals after 3rd injection. During the 1st five days, PHCL caused increases in spleen wt and (59)iron uptake in erthyrocytes and spleen, but a reduction in (59)iron uptake in femurs. All values returned to those of controls by 10 days after 3rd injection. Thirty-day survival of water injected control was 10%. Pretreatment with PHCL improved 30-day survival to almost 100% when mice were irradiated between 4 and 8 days after 3rd injection. Apparently the improved survival resulted from an increase in the number of hemopoietic stem cells at time of irradiation. /Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride/",

Wistar-rats were exposed to lead in-utero and up to four months after birth via administration of distilled drinking water containing ...lead-acetate. The animals were then maintained in a closed desiccator system for analysis of exhaled hydrocarbons before or immediately after injection of phenylhydrazine. The effect of chronic lead pretreatment was assessed by measuring the production of the four main volatile hydrocarbons: ethane and pentane as indices of lipid peroxidation; propane as a marker of protein peroxidation; and ethylene as an index of both lipid and protein peroxidations. Lead alone did not increase the physiological formation of alkanes. After phenylhydrazine injection, lipid peroxidation markers were not modified except for pentane in male lead treated rats. Ethylene and propane exhalation, on the other hand, were increased 45 minutes after phenylhydrazine injection in lead treated rats, indicating lead induced potentiation of the oxidative effect of phenylhydrazine.",

If released to the atmosphere, phenylhydrazine will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a vapor pressure of 0.026 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase phenylhydrazine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 9 hours. Phenylhydrazine also absorbs light above 290 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis; however, the kinetics of this potential reaction are not known. An estimated Koc value of 110 suggests that phenylhydrazine will have high mobility in soil. Phenylhydrazine is a weak base with a pKa of 5.21, suggesting it will partially exist as a cation in moist soil, and the cationic form may adsorb to soil more than the free base. Phenylhydrazine is not expected to volatilize from moist soil surfaces because cations do not volatilize and the Henry's Law constant of the free base is estimated as 2.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be important given the vapor pressure of this compound. Based on limited data, phenylhydrazine may biodegrade in soil and water under aerobic conditions. In an aerobic aqueous screening test, phenylhydrazine was 85% biodegraded in 9-13 days. In water, the neutral species of phenylhydrazine is not expected to adsorb to sediment and particulate matter based on its Koc value, however the cationic form may have greater adsorption potential. This compound should not volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant and the fact that cations do not volatilize. Bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is expected to be low based on an estimated BCF value of 2. Phenylhydrazine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in water as it lacks hydrolyzable functional groups, but may be subject to photolysis in sunlit surface waters. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at workplaces where phenylhydrazine is produced or used. (SRC)",

Phenylhydrazine is a weak base with a pKa of 5.21(4), suggesting it will partially exist as a cation in moist soil, and the cationic form may adsorb to soil more than the free base(SRC). Phenylhydrazine is not expected to volatilize from moist soil surfaces(SRC)because cations do not volatilize and the Henry's Law constant of the free base is estimated as 2.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure, 0.026 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 1.27X10+5 mg/L(6). In the Zahn-Wellens aqueous screening test, 85% of this compound was biodegraded in 9-13 days(7). Phenylhydrazine may be susceptible to photolysis upon exposure to sunlight on soil surfaces as it strongly absorbs UV light in the environmentally significant range (wavelengths >290 nm)(8).",

Phenylhydrazine is a weak base with a pKa of 5.21(4), suggesting it will partially exist as a cation in water, and the cationic form may adsorb to sediment more than the free base(SRC). Phenylhydrazine is not expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3)because cations do not volatilize and the Henry's Law constant of the free base is estimated as 2.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values for vapor pressure, 0.026 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 1.27X10+5 mg/L(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF value of 2(SRC), from a measured log Kow(2) and regression derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Based on limited data, phenylhydrazine may biodegrade under aerobic conditions in natural water environments(SRC). In the Zahn-Wellens aqueous screening test, 85% of this compound was biodegraded in 9-13 days(9). Phenylhydrazine is not expected to undergo hydrolysis as it lacks hydrolyzable functional groups, but may be susceptible to photolysis upon exposure to sunlight in natural waters because it strongly absorbs UV light in the environmental UV spectrum (wavelengths >290 nm)(10).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

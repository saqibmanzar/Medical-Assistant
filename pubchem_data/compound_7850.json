When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

After ip administration of AC, in doses ranging from 66 to 590 umol/kg, control rats excreted 30 +/- 6.5% of the AC dose as ALMA. HPMA was a minor urinary metabolite of AC (<3% of the AC dose), and, for this metabolite, no clear dose-excretion relationship was found. Two other minor urinary metabolites were also found as well, namely CHPMA and alpha-CH, suggesting the formation of ECH. CHPMA excretion was linear from 66 to 330 umol/kg AC and amounted to 0.21 +/- 0.08% of the AC dose. alpha-CH excretion was linear in the dose range used and was excreted for 0.13 +/- 0.02% of the AC dose. In addition, we investigated the influence of three different enzyme inducers on the urinary metabolite profile of AC, namely pyrazole, beta-naphthoflavone, and phenobarbital. Pyrazole only increased the urinary excretion of alpha-CH. beta-Naphthoflavone induction only enhanced the ALMA excretion significantly. Phenobarbital inducted both the excretion of CHPMA and alpha-CH.",

The acute (short-term) effects of allyl chloride from inhalation exposure in humans consists of irritation of the eyes and respiratory passages. Chronic (long-term) exposure to allyl chloride in humans causes injury to the liver and kidneys and the onset of pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). There are no human cancer data available for allyl chloride. Limited animal studies indicate that exposure to allyl chloride by gavage (placing the chemical experimentally in the stomachs of mice) caused an increase in the incidence of forestomach tumors. EPA has classified allyl chloride as a Group C, a possible human carcinogen.",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Sixteen of 25 mice died by the 7th day after the injection and LD50 was calculated 621 mg/kg bw (95% C.I.: 522-739 mg/kg). A marked congestion with severe hemorrhage and edema were observed in the lung. Liver and kidney damages were also found, and these were characterized by the dilated sinusoids, degenerative change of hepatic cells, and focal necrosis in the liver; and necrosis of epithelium in convoluted tubules of the kidneys. Nine mice have survived by the 7th day after the injection and all of them showed a various degree of damages in the testes. The testicular lesions could be classified into two types. One type of the lesion was characterized by degeneration and exfoliation of germ cells, appearance of polynuclear giant cells in the seminiferous tubules, and mild proliferation of Leydig cells in the interstitium. In another type of the lesion, all type of cells in tubules, including Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells became necrotic.",

Allyl chloride in corn oil was administered by gavage to two groups of each species for 5 days/wk for 78 wk, followed by an observation period of 30 to 33 wk for the rats and 14 wk for the mice. The time weighted avg doses were, respectively, 77 and 57 mg/kg/day for high and low dose male rats; 73 and 55 mg/kg/day for high and low dose female rats; 199 and 172 mg/kg/day for high and low dose male mice; and 258 and 129 mg/kg/day for high and low dose female mice. For each species, 20 animals of each sex were placed on test as vehicle controls. ... Twenty animals of each sex were placed on test as untreated controls for each species. These animals were not intubated. ... Under the conditions of this bioassay, no evidence of carcinogenicity was noted for allyl chloride in Osborne-Mendel rats of either sex. The results are suggestive that allyl chloride is carcinogenic in male and female B6C3F1 mice since the cmpd when admin by gavage, caused a low incidence of neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the forestomach.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 368 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates allyl chloride will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase allyl chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.8 days. Allyl chloride does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, allyl chloride is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 51. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.10X10-2 atm-cu m/mole. In addition, allyl chloride may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, allyl chloride is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A BOD of 62% measured in the Japanese MITI test, indicates that biodegradation of allyl chloride is expected to be an important environmental fate process. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 3 days, respectively. A calculated BCF range of <0.14 to <1.3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Allyl chloride is hydrolyzed at pH=7 with a half-life of approximately 8 days.  Occupational exposure to allyl chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where allyl chloride is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to allyl chloride via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase allyl chloride is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 0.8 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.70X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3 days(SRC). Allyl chloride's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). The potential for volatilization of allyl chloride from dry soil surfaces may exist(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

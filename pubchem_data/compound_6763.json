When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The enzyme contains an active site cysteine thiolate, which is critical for its catalytic function. As part of a continuing study of the interactions of quinones with biological systems, /the authors/ have examined the susceptibility of GAPDH to inactivation by 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PQ). In a previous study of quinone toxicity, this quinone, whose actions have been exclusively attributed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, caused a reduction in the glycolytic activity of GAPDH under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, indicating indirect and possible direct actions on this enzyme. In this study, the effects of 9,10-PQ on GAPDH were examined in detail under aerobic and anaerobic conditions so that the role of oxygen could be distinguished from the direct effects of the quinone. The results indicate that, in the presence of the reducing agent DTT, GAPDH inhibition by 9,10-PQ under aerobic conditions was mostly indirect and comparable to the direct actions of exogenously-added H2O2 on this enzyme. GAPDH was also inhibited by 9,10-PQ anaerobically, but in a somewhat more complex manner. This quinone, which is not considered an electrophile, inhibited GAPDH in a time-dependent manner, consistent with irreversible modification and comparable to the electrophilic actions of 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ). Analysis of the anaerobic inactivation kinetics for the two quinones revealed comparable inactivation rate constants (k(inac)), but a much lower inhibitor binding constant (K(i)) for 1,4-BQ. Protection and thiol titration studies suggest that these quinones bind to the NAD+ binding site and modify the catalytic thiol from this site. Thus, 9,10-PQ inhibits GAPDH by two distinct mechanisms: through ROS generation that results in the oxidization of GAPDH thiols, and by an oxygen-independent mechanism that results in the modification of GAPDH catalytic thiols.",

The endpoints were the capacity of cultures to reduce alamar Blue (AB), a measure of energy metabolism, and to convert carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester (CFDA AM) to carboxyfluorescein, an indication of membrane integrity. Only PHEQ elicited a cytotoxic response. PHEQ caused a concentration-dependent decline in AB but not in CFDA AM readings, suggesting an impairment to energy metabolism. In the presence of copper, PHEQ concentration-response curves were shifted to the left for AB and were obtained with CFDA AM. The Cu/PHEQ synergy is attributed to an increase in redox cycling and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which overwhelm antioxidant defenses, damaging energy metabolism first and then membrane integrity. The impermeable copper chelator, bathocuproine, reduced the PHEQ/copper interaction, but the permeable chelator, neocuproine, and copper together were cytotoxic.",

In this study, we show that NAC unexpectedly augments the toxicity of 9,10-PQ in cells with low NQO1 activity. In four human skin cell lines, the expression and the activity of NQO1 were lower than in human adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549 and MCF7. In the skin cells, the cytotoxicity of 9,10-PQ was significantly enhanced by addition of NAC. The formation of DNA double strand breaks accompanying phosphorylation of histone H2AX, was also remarkably augmented. On the other hand, the cyto- and genotoxicity were suppressed by addition of NAC in the adenocarcinoma cells. Two contrasting experiments: overexpression of NQO1 in CHO-K1 cells which originally expressed low NQO1 levels, and knock-down of NQO1 in the adenocarcinoma cell line A549 by transfection of RNAi, also showed that NAC suppressed 9,10-PQ-induced toxicity in cell lines expressing high NQO1 activity and enhanced it in cell lines with low NQO1 activity. The results suggested that dual effects of NAC on the cyto- and genotoxicity of 9,10-PQ were dependent on tissue-specific NQO1 activity.",

In this study, we used human promyelomonocytic U937 cells as surrogates of monocytes and investigated the toxicity mechanism initiated by exposure to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PQ), a major quinone component in diesel exhaust particles. A 24-hr incubation with 9,10-PQ provoked apoptotic cell death, which was due to signaling through the enhanced ROS generation and concomitant caspase activation. Flow cytometric analyses of U937 cells after long-term exposure to 9,10-PQ revealed induction of differentiation that was evidenced by increasing expression of CD11b/CD18, a cell-surface marker for monocytic differentiation into macrophages. The 9,10-PQ-induced differentiation was significantly abolished by ROS inhibitors, suggesting that ROS generation contributes to cell differentiation. The 9,10-PQ treatment increased the expression of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C3, which reached a peak at 1 to 2 day post-treatment and then declined. The bell-shaped curve of the AKR1C3 expression by 9,10-PQ resembled that caused by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a differentiation inducer. Additionally, the concomitant treatment with tolfenamic acid, a selective AKR1C3 inhibitor, sensitized the differentiation induced by 9,10-PQ. These results suggest that ROS formation during 9,10-PQ treatment acutely leads to apoptosis of U937 cells and the initiation of monocytic differentiation, which proceeds after the provisional overexpression of AKR1C3.",

Here, we have investigated the role of intracellular ROS generation in apoptotic signaling in human acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells treated with 9,10-PQ and the role of XR in the generation of ROS. Treatment with 9,10-PQ elicited not only apoptotic signaling, including mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and activation of caspases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, but also intracellular ROS generation and consequent glutathione depletion. The apoptotic effects of 9,10-PQ were drastically mitigated by pretreatment with intracellular ROS scavengers, such as N-acetyl-l-cysteine, glutathione monoethyl ester, and polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase, indicating that intracellular ROS generation is responsible for the 9,10-PQ-evoked apoptosis. Surprisingly, the ROS generation and cytotoxicity by 9,10-PQ were augmented in an XR-transformed cell line. XR indeed reduced 9,10-PQ and produced superoxide anion through redox cycling. In addition, the expression levels of XR and its mRNA in the T lymphoma cells were markedly enhanced after the exposure to 9,10-PQ, and the induction was completely abolished by the ROS scavengers. Moreover, the 9,10-PQ-induced apoptosis was partially inhibited by the pretreatment with XR-specific inhibitors. These results suggest that initially produced ROS induce XR, which accelerates the generation of ROS.",

Using benzo(a)pyrene monooxygenase as a measure of mixed-function oxidase activity, it was found that phenanthrene-9, 10-quinone was the most active compound tested with a K1 = 0.79 uM. Phenanthrene-9, 10-quinone did not affect cytochrome c reductase but did inhibit aminopyrine N-demethylase and p-nitroanisole-O-demethylase in both 3-MC and PB-induced microsome with almost identical inhibition constants. 1,2-Naphthoquinone exerted similar effects as phenanthrene-9,10-quinone on cytochrome c reductase, aminopyrine N-demethylase and p-nitroanisole-O-demethylase. Both quinones stimulated NADPH oxidase activity but the extent of this stimulation did not explain their inhibition of microsomal oxidation. Kinetic studies using benzo(a)-pyrene monooxygenase with phenanthrene-9, 10-quinone and 1,2-naphthoquinone indicated that they were noncompetitive with benzo(a)pyrene and mixed noncompetitive with NADPH. Both of these quinones inhibited benzo(a)pyrene induced oncogenic transformation in C3H10T1/2CL8 cells in culture in a dose response manner, presumably by inhibition of the cellular microsomal enzyme which activate benzo(a)pyrene. Phenanthrene-9, 10-quinone and 1,2-naphthoquinone seem to inhibit microsomal oxidative processes by interaction at the level of cytochrome P-450 possibly with a cytochrome P-450-substrate-oxygen complex.",

DEP is comprised of a complex mixture of chemicals whose carcinogenic potential has not been adequately assessed. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon quinone 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (9,10 PQ) is a major component of DEP and a suspect genotoxic agent for DEP induced DNA damage. 9,10 PQ undergoes redox cycling to produce reactive oxygen species that can lead to oxidative DNA damage. /The authors/ used two systems in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine possible differential genotoxicity of 9,10 PQ. The DEL assay measures intra-chromosomal homologous recombination leading to DNA deletions and the CAN assay measures forward mutations leading to canavanine resistance. Cells were exposed to 9,10 PQ aerobically and anaerobically followed by DNA damage assessment. The results indicate that 9,10 PQ induces DNA deletions and point mutations in the presence of oxygen while exhibiting negligible effects anaerobically. In contrast to the cytotoxicity observed aerobically, the anaerobic effects of 9,10 PQ seem to be cytostatic in nature, reducing growth without affecting cell viability. Thus, 9,10 PQ requires oxygen for genotoxicity while different toxicities exhibited aerobically and anaerobically suggest multiple mechanisms of action.",

The strongest mutagenic effects in the reversion assay were observed with phenanthrene 9,10-oxide, 9-hydroxyphenanthrene and N-benzyl-phenanthrene-9,10-imine. Interestingly, the mutagenic potency of the arene imine was similar to that of the corresponding arene oxide. This is the first report on the mutagenicity of arene imine. The mutagenic effects of all these phenanthrene derivatives were much weaker than that of the positive control benzo[a]pyrene 4,5-oxide. Even weaker mutagenicity was found with cis-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene and with trans-9,10-dihydroxy-9-10-dihydrophenanthrene. The other derivatives were inactive in this test. However, 9-10-dihydroxyphenanthrene and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone were more toxic to the rec- B. subtilis M45 strain than to the rec+ H17 strain. This was also true for phenanthrene 9,10-oxide and 9-hydroxyphenanthrene, but not with the other test compounds that reverted (9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrenes; N-benzyl-phenanthrene 9,10-imine; benzo[a]pyrene 4,5-oxide) or did not revert (phenanthrene, 9,10-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-phenanthrene 9,10-oxide, 9-10-diacetoxyphenanthrene) the Salmonella tester strains. Although the K region is a main site of metabolism and although all potential K-region metabolites were mutagenic, phenanthrene did not show a mutagenic effect in the presence of mouse-liver microsomes and an NADPH-generating system under standard conditions. However, when epoxide hydratase was inhibited, phenanthrene was activated to a mutagen that reverted his- S. typhimurium. This shows that demonstration of the mutagenic activity of metabolites together with the knowledge that a major metabolic route proceeds via these metabolites dose not automatically imply a mutagenic hazard of the mother compound, because the metabolites in question may not accumulate in sufficient quantities and therefore the presence and relative activities of enzymes that control the mutagenically active metabolites are crucial. N-Benzyl-phenanthrene 9.10-imine was mutagenic for the episome-containing S. typhimurium TA98 and TA100 but not for the precursor strains TA1538 and TA1535. This arene imine would therefore be useful as a positive control during routine testing to monitor in the former strains the presence of the episome which is rather easily lost.",

Mutagenicity via this pathway was attributable to the generation of oxygen radicals. Cytochrome p450 monooxygenase also played a significant role in the detoxification of this quinone. Phenanthrenequinone was converted to a nonmutagenic metabolite in a cytochrome p450 dependent reaction.",

It can also be formed in soil as a metabolite of phenanthrene biodegradation. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.5X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 9,10-phenanthrenedione will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase 9,10-phenanthrenedione will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2.6 days. Particulate-phase 9,10-phenanthrenedione will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. 9,10-Phenanthrenedione absorbs UV light strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 9,10-phenanthrenedione is expected to have very high mobility based upon a an estimated Koc of 28. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-9 atm-cu m/mole. 9,10-Phenanthrenedione is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. One biodegradation study found 9,10-phenanthrenedione resistant to biodegradation. If released into water, 9,10-phenanthrenedione is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 21 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to 9,10-phenanthrenedione may occur through dermal contact with this compound or other products containing 9,10-phenanthrenedione and through inhalation exposure to diesel exhaust. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 9,10-phenanthrenedione via inhalation of ambient air. (SRC)",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

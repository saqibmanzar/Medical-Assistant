Although the exact mechanism of action of methsuximide is unclear, it is thought to increase the seizure threshold and suppress the paroxysmal three-cycle-per-second spike-and-wave pattern seen with absence (petit mal) seizures. The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex and elevation of the threshold of the CNS to convulsive stimuli, probably due to direct modification of membrane function in excitable cells and/or alteration of chemically mediated neurotransmission.",

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the low-voltage activated (LVA) group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Profound CNS depression following methsuximide overdosage has been attributed to this metabolite, and it is probable that the anticonvulsant effects of the drug result from NDM. Overdosage of methsuccimide may follow a biphasic course; patients have awakened and relapsed into coma within 24 hours. In one study in patients receiving methsuximide chronically, the plasma concentration of NDM was 700 times greater than the simultaneous plasma concentration of methsuximide. On the basis of this one study, a tentative therapeutic plasma NDM concentration of 10-40 ug/mL has been proposed; plasma NDM concentrations exceeding 40 ug/mL have been associated with toxicity and coma has been reported at plasma NDM concentrations of 150 ug/mL.",

Plasma methsuximide levels were described by a two-compartment open model, and those of the metabolite were described by a one-compartment open model. An expression was derived that describes both methsuximide and metabolite plasma levels after methsuximide administration. Excellent fits were obtained between observed data and those predicted from the model. The metabolite, 2-methyl-2-phenylsuccinimide accounted for 40% of the overall elimination of methsuximide, and the half-life of the metabolite (15 hr) was much greater than that of the parent drug (1-3.5 hr). The results suggest that pharmacological effects after methsuximide administration may be due primarily to the metabolite, which may accumulate in the body during repeated doses.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the \"low-voltage activated (LVA)\" group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes.",

The frequency of attacks is reduced by depression of nerve transmission in the motor cortex. These effects may be due to direct modification of membrane function in excitable cells and/or alteration of chemically mediated neurotransmission. The specific effect of ethosuximide against absence seizures appears to be due to its ability to block T-type calcium channels at concentrations that do not affect other ion channels. /Succinimide anticonvulsants/",

Despite the widespread acceptance of this hypothesis, recent studies using rat and cat neurons have failed to confirm inhibition of T-type currents at therapeutically relevant concentrations. The present study re-examines this issue using the three cloned human channels that constitute the T-type family: alpha 1G, alpha 1H, and alpha 1I. The cloned cDNAs were stably transfected and expressed into mammalian cells, leading to the appearance of typical T-type currents. The results demonstrate that both ethosuximide and the active metabolite of methsuximide, alpha-methyl-alpha-phenylsuccinimide (MPS), block human T-type channels in a state-dependent manner, with higher affinity for inactivated channels. In contrast, succinimide analogs that are not anticonvulsive were relatively poor blockers. The apparent affinity of MPS for inactivated states of the three channels was estimated using two independent measures: K(I) for alpha 1G and alpha 1I was 0.3 to 0.5 mM and for alpha 1H was 0.6 to 1.2 mM. T-type channels display current at the end of long pulses (persistent current), and this current was especially sensitive to block (ethosuximide IC(50) = 0.6 mM). These drugs also reduced both the size of the T-type window current region and the currents elicited by a mock low threshold spike. /The authors/ conclude that succinimide antiepileptic drugs are capable of blocking human T-type channels at therapeutically relevant concentrations.",

A previous study ... demonstrated that PSX (0.3 or 0.6 mmol/kg/day ip) induced urotoxicity following daily administration for 5-7 days in Fischer 344 rats, but PSX (1.25 mmol/kg, ip) induced only minimal urotoxicity following acute administration. The purpose of this study was to determine the acute nephrotoxic potential of MSX and ESX in male Fischer 344 rats and if antiepileptic succinimide induced urotoxicity is potentiated by phenobarbital pretreatment. In one set of experiments, rats (four rats per group) were administered a single ip injection of a succinimide (0.4 or 1.0 mmol/kg) or vehicle (sesame oil, 2.5 mL/kg), and the renal function was monitored at 24 and 48 hr. Neither ESX or MSX induced substantial changes in renal function or morphology, which suggests that neither compound is acutely nephrotoxic. Similar results were obtained with PSX, whiCh supported ... earlier findings with this antiepileptic agent. In a second set of experiments, rats (four rats per group) were pretreated for 3 days with phenobarbital (75 mg kg/day, ip) prior to receiving a succinimide (0.4 or 1.0 mmol/kg, ip) or vehicle (sesame oil, 2.5 mL/kg, ip). Renal function was monitored at 24 and 48 hr after the last injection. Phenobarbital pretreatment had only minor effects on ESX or MSX induced renal effects, with no significant morphological changes detected between treated and pair fed control groups.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

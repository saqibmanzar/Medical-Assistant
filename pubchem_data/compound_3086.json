When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Skin changes were recorded at 24, 48, and 72 hr, as well as 7 days after the start of the exposure. After an exposure for both 30 min and 4 hr, scale formation and necroses passing beyond the application area were observed.

Do not allow spilled material or wash water to enter sewers, surface waters, or groundwater systems. Remove all sources of ignition, including flames, heat, and sparks. Ventilate area to remove vapors or dust. Evacuate and keep unnecessary people out of spill area. Cover spill with damp, fluid-binding material (for example, sand, sawdust, chemical binder based on calcium silicate hydrate). Transfer to an open waste container after approximately one hour, cover loosely and remove to an isolated area. Do not seal the container as carbon dioxide given off by the slow reaction between Velcorin and water may cause a tightly sealed container to burst. Flush the spill with cold water but avoid flushing into open drains. Hot water should never be used for this purpose since it would cause considerable vaporization of the spilled material. Use the paper Velcorin indicator strips to insure that there is no residual Dimethyl Dicarbonate in the air.",

Remove empty bottle from automatic metering system to a well-ventilated area (outdoors is also suitable). Fill bottle carefully with water to the brim so as to avoid overflow. Do not tighten the screw lid back on the container due to possible pressurization from evolution of carbon dioxide. After 24 hours of standing, the water containing the hydrolyzed products of the residual amount of Velcorin can be added to the plant's waste water. The bottle may then be disposed of like any other glass container. Soiled empty containers are to be treated in the same manner.",

Groups of 15 male and 15 female rats received orange juice, black currant juice, beer (lager type), or wine (Riesling) without (control groups) or with 4000 mg/L DMDC instead of drinking water for a period of 3 months. The animals were inspected daily. Body weights and food consumption were recorded weekly, drink consumption daily.  Clinical chemical tests were performed on five rats of each sex for every group 1 and 3 months after the start of the experiment. Hematological parameters investigated were hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell volume (MCV), the reticulocyte count, differential blood count, and, at the end of the experiment, thromboblastin time. Liver function was assessed by measurement of the activities of alkaline phosphatase (AP), glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase (GPT), glutamate-oxalacetate-transaminase (GOT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), as well as the concentrations of bilirubin in the blood plasma.  Kidney function was assessed by measurement of plasma urea and creatinine concentrations as well as by urinalysis.  Blood glucose and cholesterol levels were also  determined.  Surviving animals were autopsied at the end of the experiment, animals that died earlier were autopsied immediately. Samples from 22 different tissues were fixed for histopathological examinations. Animals receiving DMDC showed no differences in appearance, behavior, or consumption of drink or food as compared to the corresponding controls. Body weight gain was not significantly different in animals receiving DMDC in comparison with the respective controls.  Application of DMDC did not affect mortality.  No significant differences in hematological parameters or in parameters of liver and kidney function were observed between rats receiving DMDC and their controls. Also, blood glucose and cholesterol concentrations remained within physiological ranges for all groups. On autopsy, no pathological changes attributable to the treatment were observed in any group. Only slight and randomly distributed differences in organ weights were seen. Histomorphological examination of fixed organs revealed no changes which were attributable to the administration of DMDC-treated drinks.  It was concluded that 4000 mg DMDC/L in fruit juice or alcoholic beverage was tolerated by rats without signs of toxicity.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.46 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dimethyl dicarbonate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase dimethyl dicarbonate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 24.6 days. Dimethyl dicarbonate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, dimethyl dicarbonate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Dimethyl dicarbonate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data in soil or water were not available; however, structurally similar dimethyl cabonate was >90% biodegraded in the Modified MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, dimethyl dicarbonate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.2 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. The alkyl carbonate esters hydrolyze very slowly in water when compared to the chloroformates. Under alkaline conditions, the rates of hydrolysis are similar to those of the corresponding acetic acid esters. Occupational exposure to dimethyl dicarbonate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where dimethyl dicarbonate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general public may be exposed to dimethyl dicarbonate via ingestion of foods containing this preservative. Dimethyldicarbonate (DMDC) is unstable in aqueous solution and breaks down almost immediately after addition to beverages; principal breakdown products in wine and aqueous liquids are methanol and carbon dioxide.

Volatilization from water surfaces may be expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.5X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.7 hours and 5.3 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3.2(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -0.86(6) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Dimethyldicarbonate (DMDC) is unstable in aqueous solution and breaks down almost immediately after addition to beverages; principal breakdown products in wine and aqueous liquids are methanol and carbon dioxide(8). Biodegradation data in water were not available(SRC, 2013); however, structurally similar dimethyl carbonate was >90% biodegraded in the Modified MITI test(8), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The alkyl carbonate esters hydrolyze very slowly in water when compared to the chloroformates. Under alkaline conditions, the rates of hydrolysis are similar to those of the corresponding acetic acid esters. The net result is the formation of hydroxy compounds and carbon dioxide(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

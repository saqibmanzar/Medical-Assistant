Ibudilast (IBD) is able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Upon administration, IBD exerts its potential anti-tumor activity against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells by inhibiting PDE-4 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which results in a decrease in MIF, its receptor CD74, and AKT expression, and attenuates the immunosuppressive properties of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and reduces T-regulatory cells (Tregs). This causes GBM cell apoptosis and inhibits GBM cell proliferation. In addition, IBD reduces, through its inhibitory effect on various PDEs, the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL- 1beta, leukotriene B4, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). IBD also upregulates the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and promotes the production of neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). It also blocks toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), inhibits nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and reduces the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also prevents platelet aggregation, causes cerebral vasodilation, bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, and improves cerebral blood flow. In addition, IBD attenuates the PDE-mediated activation of glial cells and abrogates PDE-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. MIF is secreted by cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is highly expressed within GBM and plays a key role in tumor cell proliferation. Co-expression of MIF and CD74 in GBM is associated with poor patient survival.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

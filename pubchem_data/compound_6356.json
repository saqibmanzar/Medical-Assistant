PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Explosive limits specify the concentration range of a material in air which will burn or explode in the presence of an ignition source.

The explosive limits are usually given as the percent by volume of the material in the air (e.g., 5%).",

The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

IDLH values are established (1) to ensure that the worker can escape from a given contaminated environment in the event of failure of the respiratory protection equipment and (2) to indicate a maximum level above which only a highly reliable breathing apparatus, providing maximum worker protection, is permitted.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Testing was conducted using groups of 10 male and 10 female rats (BF(3)) or groups of 6 male rats (FSA). Rats were exposed for a single 4-hr period (BF(3)) or a single 1-hr period (FSA) and necropsied 1 or 14 days after exposure (BF(3)) or 14 days after exposure (FSA). Measurements consisted of clinical signs, body weight, kidney and lung weight, histopathology (BF(3)), and breathing parameters (FSA) and were used to evaluate the possible irritating effects of these compounds. The results indicated treatment-related findings in the larynx and trachea in the rats exposed to 74.4 mg/cu m BF(3), consisting of ventral cartilage necrosis, hemorrhage, and an increase in ventral epithelial hyperplasia and ventral inflammatory cell inflammation 24 hr postexposure. In the animals sacrificed 14 days postexposure, the only notable observation was ventral cartilage necrosis, present in 2 animals. The next lower level tested, 24.6 mg/cu m BF, was considered a no-observed-adverse-effects level (NOAEL). A concentration of 4125 mg/m(3) FSA resulted in a clearly decreased breathing rate during and shortly after exposure with 67% (4/6) mortality on days 5-9 after exposure. A concentration of 845 mg/m(3) FSA resulted in only minor signs of irritation, consisting of slight changes in breathing pattern shorlty after exposure. The results of the present 4-h inhalation study with BF(3) indicated that respiratory irritation was present at a level of 74.4 mg/cu m whereas 24.6 mg/cu m was a NOAEL. A single 1-hr exposure to 845 mg/cu m FSA resulted in only minor signs of respiratory irritation, indicating that on a mass basis FSA is no more toxic or irritating than hydrogen fluoride (HF) or sulfuric acid.",

It sets up criteria for the classification of chemicals for physical-chemical, health, and environmental hazards of chemical substances and mixtures and sets up standardized hazard information to facilitate global trade of chemicals.  Please note that obsolete codes are added in this classification for completeness purposes, as they are still in use. Any obsolete codes are annotated as such.",

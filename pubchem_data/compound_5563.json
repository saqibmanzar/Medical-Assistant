                        "Description": "A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using a single line of chemical element symbols and numbers. PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

If released to the atmosphere, triclofos will exist in both the vapor phase and particulate phase based on an estimated vapor pressure of 2.13X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. It will degrade in the vapor phase by reaction with hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of 10 days. Particulate phase triclofos may be removed physically from air by wet and dry deposition. In soil, triclofos is expected to have moderate mobility; some leaching may be possible as triclofos should be fairly water soluble. Hydrolysis of triclofos in soil may be an important fate process, particularly under alkaline soil conditions. In water, hydrolysis may be a major fate process for triclofos, particularly if the water is alkaline. An estimated Henry's Law constant of 5.64X10-7 atm-cu/mole indicates that this compound will not volatilize from water surfaces. Triclofos is not expected to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms.

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 10 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1,SRC). Hydrolysis of triclofos is expected to be rapid. Hydrolysis of phosphate esters is generally promoted by alkaline conditions as the phosphate ester undergoes second order nucleophilic reactions involving cleavage of the O-P bond due to hydroxide ions(2). A half-life of 852 years has been reported for methyl phosphate in water at 25 \u00b0C and at a pH 4.17(3); the reaction rate was 2.57X10-11 1/sec(3). The three chlorines on the ethyl will act as electron withdrawing groups and will promote hydrolysis by OH-(2). In addition, monoalkyl phosphates, which exist as mono and dianions at common environmental pH's, are generally more susceptible to hydrolysis than the di- or triesters. Thus under alkaline conditions triclofos may hydrolyze fairly rapidly(2,SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

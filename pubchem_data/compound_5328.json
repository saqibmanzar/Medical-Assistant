All the chelates showed an intense charge transfer absorption band at the blue end of the visible region. The stereochemical characteristics of the chelates were illustrated by means of the absorptions caused by the d-d transitions. The Ni(II) and Co(II) chelates are 6 coordinated in all cases.",

The stoichiometry was found to be 1:1 for all compounds. The metal content determined by the described method agreed with theoretical values. Structure analysis by infrared spectrometry and x-ray diffraction is also included. Thermostability of these Schiff bases was investigated using a thermogravimetric method. Decomposition began at 200-290 \u00b0C for the Schiff bases, while chelates began to decompose at 60-120 \u00b0C. Stable oxides were formed by all chelated at 530-800 \u00b0C. The orders and the activation energies of some decomposition reactions were calculated for the chelates on the basis of the thermograms.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Because photosensitivity may also occur, patients should be cautioned against exposure to UV light or prolonged exposure to sunlight. A relatively high proportion of fatalities has occurred as a result of the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, especially in children. Although long-acting sulfonamides (which are no longer commercially available) have been associated most often with the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, other sulfonamides also have been reported to cause this reaction. The physician should be alert to the signs, including high fever, severe headache, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urethritis, and balanitis, which may precede the onset of the cutaneous lesions of the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a rash develops during therapy, the sulfonamide should be discontinued at once. In rare instances, a skin rash may precede a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis, and/or serious blood disorders. /Sulfonamides/"

Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections.

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Most sulfonamides are metabolized mainly by N4-acetylation. The degree of acetylation, which is a function of time, varies from less than 5% for sulfamethizole to up to 40% for sulfadiazine. The N4-acetyl metabolites, which do not possess antibacterial activity, have greater affinity for plasma albumin than does the nonacetylated drug and are usually less soluble than the parent sulfonamide, particularly in acidic urine. Like acetyl derivatives, glucuronide derivatives do not possess antibacterial activity; however, glucuronide derivatives are water soluble, appear to resemble the nonacetylated sulfonamide in plasma binding capacity, and have not been associated with adverse effects. /Sulfonamides/",

Sulfonamides interfere with the utilization of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid (the reduced form of folic acid) cofactors in susceptible bacteria. Sulfonamides are structural analogs of PABA and appear to interfere with PABA utilization by competitively inhibiting the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, which catalyzes the formation of dihydropteroic acid (a precursor of tetrahydrofolic acid) from PABA and pteridine; however, other mechanism(s) affecting the biosynthetic pathway also may be involved. Compounds such as pyrimethamine and trimethoprim, which block later stages in the synthesis of folic acid, act synergistically with sulfonamides. Only microorganisms that synthesize their own folic acid are inhibited by sulfonamides; animal cells and bacteria which are capable of utilizing folic acid precursors or preformed folic acid are not affected by these drugs. The antibacterial activity of the sulfonamides is reportedly decreased in the presence of blood or purulent body exudates. /Sulfonamides/",

Because dihydrofolate synthesis is reduced, the levels of tetrahydrofolate (folinic acid) formed from dihydrofolate diminish. Tetrahydrofolate is an essential component of the coenzymes responsible for single carbon metabolism in cells. Acting as antimetabolites to PABA, sulfonamides eventually block, in a complex fashion, several enzymes. These enzymes include those needed for the biogenesis of purine bases; for the transfer of desoxyuridine to thymidine; and for the biosynthesis of methionine, glycine, and formylmethionyl-transfer-RNA. This results in suppression of protein synthesis, impairment of metabolic processes, and inhibition of growth and multiplication of those organisms that cannot use preformed folate. The effect is bacteriostatic, although a bactericidal action is evident at the high concentrations that may be found in urine.",

The risk of adverse birth and neonatal outcome, and miscarriage in women who used sulfamethizole during pregnancy /was investigated/. The association between use of sulfamethizole and adverse birth and neonatal outcome was investigated in a case-control and a cohort study in Denmark. /Investigators/ used data from the Prescription Database, the Birth Registry and the Hospital Discharge Registry in North Jutland County to study any association between sulfamethizole use and first recorded miscarriage. The cohort analysis included 3484 women who received a prescription for sulfamethizole from 30 days before conception to date of delivery, and 60175 women who did not use a sulphonamide-containing drug during pregnancy or 30 days before conception. The case-control analysis included 3347 women who had a miscarriage, of whom 90 had taken sulfamethizole, and 22599 primiparous controls who had a live birth. Among women who received prescriptions for sulfamethizole, adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for adverse birth outcome were: malformation 1.17 (0.95-1.43); low birth weight 0.69 (0.49-0.98); pre-term birth 1.12 (0.97-1.30); stillbirth 1.02 (0.61-1.68); neonatal jaundice 1.14 (0.38-3.46); and for receiving a prescription for sulfamethizole within 1 week before miscarriage 1.66 (0.92-2.99). /Investigators/ found no increased risk of congenital malformation, stillbirth or pre-term birth, and no association between use of sulfamethizole late in pregnancy and risk of neonatal jaundice. There was an increased risk of miscarriage after exposure to sulfamethizole during the week before miscarriage, but further studies are needed to evaluate whether this increased risk is causal.",

Because photosensitivity may also occur, patients should be cautioned against exposure to UV light or prolonged exposure to sunlight. A relatively high proportion of fatalities has occurred as a result of the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, especially in children. Although long-acting sulfonamides (which are no longer commercially available) have been associated most often with the Stevens-Johnson syndrome, other sulfonamides also have been reported to cause this reaction. The physician should be alert to the signs, including high fever, severe headache, stomatitis, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urethritis, and balanitis, which may precede the onset of the cutaneous lesions of the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. If a rash develops during therapy, the sulfonamide should be discontinued at once. In rare instances, a skin rash may precede a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatic necrosis, and/or serious blood disorders. /Sulfonamides/"

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 2.1X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sulfamethizole will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase sulfamethizole will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Sulfamethizole contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, sulfamethizole is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 47. Amphoteric sulfonamides behave as weak acids. The pKa1 and pKa2 of sulfamethizole are 2.1 and 5.3, respectively, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. In general, sulfonamide antimicrobials are not readily biodegraded and persist in soils. If released into water, sulfamethizole is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization of the neutral species from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon the estimated Henry's Law constant. The pKa values indicate sulfamethizole will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. By analogy to structurally similar sulfamethoxazole which did not undergo hydrolysis under field conditions, hydrolysis of sulfamethizole is not expected to be an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to sulfamethizole may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sulfamethizole is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to sulfamethizole via dermal contact and administration of pharmaceutical products containing sulfamethizole. (SRC)",

The pKa1 and pKa2 values for sulfamethizole are 2.1 and 5.3(4), respectively, indicating that this compound will partially exist in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts(5). Volatilization of the neutral species from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-14 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(6). Sulfamethizole is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 2.1X10-9 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(7).

A pKa1 and pKa2 of 2.1 and 5.3(4), respectively, indicate sulfamethizole will exist partially in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(5). By analogy to structurally similar sulfamethoxazole which did not undergo hydrolysis under field conditions(9), hydrolysis of sulfamethizole is not expected to be an important environmental fate process(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC).

Sulfamethizole is expected to be readily photodegraded in most natural waters as the anionic form is most susceptible to direct photodegradation. In aqueous solution, direct photolysis rates under natural sunlight were reported as <0.3X10-5/sec (pH 2.4); 0.5X10-5/sec (pH 5.2); 1.3X10-5/sec (pH 6.7); 1.3X10-5/sec (pH 8.6), resulting in sulfanilic acid(4).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

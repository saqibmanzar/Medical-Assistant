When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

These compounds also have a central nervous system (CNS) anesthetic effect analogous to a structurally similar general anesthetic, halothane. Pressurized refrigerant or liquid fluorocarbons with a low boiling point have a cryogenic effect on exposed tissues, causing frostbite, laryngeal or pulmonary edema, and gastrointestinal perforation. Certain fluorocarbons degrade at high temperatures into toxic products of chlorine, hydrofluoric acid, or phosgene gases. /Freons/",

The traditional, liquid-phase process uses antimony pentafluoride or a mixture of antimony trifluoride and chlorine as catalysts. Continuous vapor-phase processes that employ gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of heterogenous chromium, iron, or fluorinated alumina catalysts also are widely used. Carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and hexachloroethane (or tetrachloroethylene plus chlorine) are commonly used starting materials for one- and two-carbon chlorofluorocarbons. The extent of chlorine exchange can be controlled by varying the hydrogen fluoride concentration, the contact time, or the reaction temperature. /CFCs and HCFCs/",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

The original Montreal Protocol was agreed on 16 September 1987 and entered into force on 1 January 1989. The Montreal Protocol includes a unique adjustment provision that enables the Parties to the Protocol to respond quickly to new scientific information and agree to accelerate the reductions required on chemicals already covered by the Protocol. These adjustments are then automatically applicable to all countries that ratified the Protocol. Since its initial adoption, the Montreal Protocol has been adjusted five times. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Nineteenth Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the Montreal Protocol, certain adjustments and reductions of production and consumption of the controlled substances listed in the Annexes of the Protocol. These adjustments entered into force, for all the Parties, on 7 March 1991, 23 September 1993, 5 August 1996, 4 June 1998, 28 July 2000 and 14 May 2008, respectively. In addition to adjusting the Protocol, the Parties to the Montreal Protocol have amended the Protocol to enable, among other things, the control of new chemicals and the creation of a financial mechanism to enable developing countries to comply. Specifically, the Second, Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Meetings of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4 of Article 9 of the Vienna Convention, four Amendments to the Protocol - the London Amendment (1990), the Copenhagen Amendment (1992), the Montreal Amendment (1997) and the Beijing Amendment (1999). Unlike adjustments to the Protocol, amendments must be ratified by countries before their requirements are applicable to those countries. The London, Copenhagen, Montreal and Beijing Amendments entered into force on 10 August 1992, 14 June 1994, 10 November 1999 and 25 February 2002, respectively, only for those Parties which ratified the particular amendments. In addition to adjustments and amendments to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties to the Protocol meet annually and take a variety of decisions aimed at enabling effective implementation of this important legal instrument. Through the 22nd Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, the Parties have taken over 720 decisions.",

The Clean Air Act requires FDA, in consultation with the EPA, to determine whether an FDA-regulated product that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS. FDA has concluded that there are no substantial technical barriers to formulating flunisolide, triamcinolone, metaproterenol, pirbuterol, albuterol and ipratropium in combination, cromolyn, and nedocromil as products that do not release ODSs, and therefore they will no longer be essential uses of ODSs as of the effective dates of this rule. MDIs for these active moieties containing an ODS may not be marketed after the relevant effective date. DATES: Removal of Part 2.125(e)(2)(iii) and 2.125(e)(4)(vii) is effective June 14, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(v) and 2.125(e)(4)(iv) is effective December 31, 2010. Removal of Part 2.125(e)(1)(iii) is effective June 30, 2011. Removal of 2.125(e)(2)(iv) and Part 2.125(e)(4)(viii) is effective December 31, 2013. /Ozone-Depleting Substances/",

Exposure to the chlorofluorocarbon mixture significantly reduced forced expiratory volume for 2 hr, relative to \"no treatment\", and for 8 hr relative to exposure to fenoterol (containing CFC-11 and CFC-12). The results suggest that chlorofluorcarbons can decrease bronchial tone in asthmatic patients, but that this effect is transient and of a sufficiently small magnitude to be superseded by the dilating effects of fenoterol when both fenoterol and chlorofluorcarbon propellants are inhaled together.",

Patients must be removed from the exposure environment, and high-flow supplemental oxygen should be utilized. The respiratory system should be evaluated for injury, aspiration, or pulmonary edema and treated appropriately. CNS findings should be treated supportively. A calm environment with no physical exertion is imperative to avoid increasing endogenous adrenegic levels. Exogenous adrenergic drugs must not be used to avoid inducing sensitized myocardial dysrhythmias. Atropine is ineffective in treating bradyarrhythmias. For ventricular dysrhythmias, diphenylhydantoin and countershock may be effective. Cryogenic dermal injuries should be treated by water bath rewarming at 40 to 42 \u00b0C until vasodilatory flush has returned. Elevation of the limb and standard frostbite management with late surgical debridement should be utilized. Ocular exposure requires irrigation and slit-lamp evaluation for injury. /Freons/",

Ambulatory electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded for 24 hours on the day of exposure and on a control day. The ECG tapes were automatically analyzed with a Reynolds pathfinder 3 apparatus and all aberrant complexes recorded by the machine were checked. One person read all the tapes without knowing whether or not they were recorded during exposure. The number of ventricular ectopic beats were compared between the day of exposure and the control day and with the tape of the control. In addition, the number of ventricular ectopic beats during exposure was compared with the number occurring during the rest of the day. The concentrations of fluorocarbons were measured in four instances. High peak concentrations of fluorocarbons (1300-10,000 cc/cu m) were measured during refrigerator repair work. No clear connection between fluorocarbons and cardiac arrhythmia was found, although one subject had several ventricular ectopic beats which may have been connected with exposure.",

The average concentrations of fluorocarbons during work were 170 to 815 cu cm/cu m and the peak concentrations were 1300 to 10,000 cu cm/ cu m.

A number of biological end-points, including clinical hematology and chemistry, ECG, EEG, pulmonary function, neurological parameters, and cognitive tests were monitored. Single exposures to CFC-11 or CFC-12 at concentrations of 0.025% (CFC-11, 1.4 g/cu m, CFC-1, 1.2 g/cu m), 0.05% (CFC-11, 2.8 g/cu m, CFC-123, 2.5 g/cu m), and 0.1% (CFC-11, 5.6 g/cu m, CFC-12, 5 g/cu m, for 1 min to 8 hr, induced no observable effects. There was a statistically-significant decrease in cognitive test performance in subjects exposed to CFC-11 at 5.6 g/cu m, 8 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 2-4 weeks, but not in subjects exposed to CFC-12 at 5 g/cu m.",

In the present study, the effects of FC 12 on the electrical activity of cells in the atrial and ventricular myocardium of anesthetized rats were recorded with \"flexibly mounted\" intracellular microelectrodes. The major phenomena observed in both types of cells were: a distinct decrease in the diastolic potential, a decrease in the amplitude of the action potential, modifications in the shape of the action potential. Analysis of the simultaneously obtained electrocardiogram specifies the rhythm abnormalities which consist of an important decrease in the atrio-ventricular conduction and changes in the myocardial excitability. The cardiotoxicity of FC 12 is assumed to affect passive or active transmembrane ionic movements. ...",

It is being phased out under the terms of the Montreal Protocol. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4850 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dichlorodifluoromethane will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Dichlorodifluoromethane does not react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone molecules or nitrate radicals. The compound will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone. The half-life for this reaction has been estimated to range from 105 to 169 years. Dichlorodifluoromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere. If released to soil, dichlorodifluoromethane is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 75. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.343 atm-cu m/mole. Dichlorodifluoromethane is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Dichlorodifluoromethane is resistant to aerobic biodegradation in soil; however, when incubated anaerobically using fresh household domestic waste, dichlorodifluoromethane exhibited a degradation rate constant of 0.029/day, corresponding to a half-life of 23.9 days. If released into water, dichlorodifluoromethane is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Dichlorodifluoromethane was degraded under anaerobic conditions over a 100 day incubation period using a sediment inoculum. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 12 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure should be low or non-existent since dichlorodifluoroethane is no longer produced or used in the US. Monitoring data indicate that the general population could be exposed to dichlorodifluoromethane via inhalation of ambient air due to the long atmospheric residence time of dichlorodifluoromethane.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 0.343 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3 hrs and 4 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 12(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Dichlorodifluoromethane is resistant to aerobic biodegradation(7); however, the compound was degraded under anaerobic conditions over a 100 day incubation period using a sediment inoculum(7).",

Dichlorodifluoromethane does not react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone molecules or nitrate radicals(3,4). The compound will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone(SRC). The half-life for this reaction has been estimated to range from 105 to 169 years(4). Dichlorodifluoromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Dichlorodifluoromethane does not react with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals, ozone molecules or nitrate radicals(1,2). Dichlorodifluoromethane will gradually diffuse into the stratosphere above the ozone layer where it will slowly degrade due to direct photolysis from UV-C radiation and contribute to the catalytic removal of stratospheric ozone(2). The half-life for this reaction has been estimated to range from 105(3) to 169 years(2). In the stratosphere, the compound can breakdown to carbonyl difluoride and chlorine atoms; the ozone depletion potential is 1.0(4). Dichlorodifluoromethane is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(5). Dichlorodifluoromethane does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight in the troposphere(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Methyl n-octanoate was detected in cassava roots, nectarines and grape juice. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.54 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl n-octanoate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl n-octanoate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 2 days. Methyl n-octanoate may also undergo direct photolysis since it contains a functional group that can absorb UV light at greater than 290 nm, but the kinetics of this reaction are unknown. If released to soil, methyl n-octanoate is expected to have low mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1,500. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.83X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon the vapor pressure. Methyl n-octanoate was shown to be biodegradable under aerobic conditions using an activated sludge in a single screening study. If released into water, methyl n-octanoate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 5 days, respectively. Hydrolysis is expected to be a slow environmental fate process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 121 days and 3.3 years at pH 8 and 7, respectively. An estimated BCF of 72 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Occupational exposure to methyl n-octanoate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl n-octanoate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to methyl n-octanoate through the ingestion of foods containing this compound and from consumer porducts containing this product. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 7.83X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 5 days, respectively(SRC). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.063 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(5); this corresponds to half-lives of 3.3 years and 121 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(5). Methyl n-octanoate was rapidly oxidized with an activated sludge inoculum(6), suggesting this compound will biodegrade in water surfaces(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 72(SRC), from its log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

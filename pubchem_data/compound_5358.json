Sumatriptan selectively binds to and activates serotonin 5-HT1D receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby constricting cerebral blood vessels. This may lead to a relief in pain from vascular headaches. Sumatriptan may also relieve vascular headaches by decreasing the release of vasoactive neuropeptides from perivascular trigeminal axons in the dura mater during a migraine, by reducing extravasation of plasma proteins, and by decreasing the release of other mediators of inflammation from the trigeminal nerve.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

A prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in Tochal Mountain Hotel at an altitude of 3,500 meters above sea level during October 2006 to November 2006. A total of 102 Iranian adults were assigned to receive either sumatriptan succinate (50mg) or placebo within 1 hour of ascent. AMS incidence was measured by Lake Louise AMS score > or = 3 with headache and one other symptom. Secondary outcome measures included severity of syndrome (Lake Louise scores > or = 5), incidence of headache, and severity of headache. Based on intention-to-treat analysis, AMS was more prevalent in placebo group (n = 23 [45.1%]) than sumatriptan group (n = 12 [23.5%]; p = 0.02). Headache also had a greater rate for placebo users (placebo vs sumatriptan group: 29 [56.9%] vs 17 [33.3%]; p = 0.02). No association was detected between sumatriptan prophylaxis and AMS or altitude headache severity. Sumatriptan prophylaxis is effective to prevent AMS development. Furthermore, our findings confirm cerebral vasodilative and edematous mechanisms of AMS progression, whereas sumatriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine(1) receptor subtype agonist and a selective cerebral vasoconstrictor as a result",

This patient had been hospitalized numerous times for cyclic vomiting over the previous 4 years, each hospitalization lasting from 3 to 11 days. Following a single subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan 6 mg, the patient ceased vomiting and was discharged 40 hours from the time of admission. The efficacy of sumatriptan in migraine headache appears to be mediated through its agonist activity at the serotonin1D receptor, resulting in constriction of dural blood vessels. According to published reports, therapeutic attempts at controlling cyclic vomiting often have included antimigraine therapies. Consistent with these reports, sumatriptan also appears effective in the treatment of cyclic vomiting.  The pathogenesis of cyclic vomiting appears to share similarities with classic migraine, both of which may respond to sumatriptan therapy according to this report and previous work. Further study of the use of sumatriptan in the treatment of cyclic vomiting appears warranted.",

Common adverse effects reported in patients receiving oral sumatriptan for the treatment of migraine or cluster headache include malaise or fatigue, nausea or vomiting, dizziness or vertigo, tingling, and nasal discomfort. Since some adverse effects noted with sumatriptan therapy (eg, nausea or gastric symptoms, tingling, photophobia, visual disturbances, headache, numbness, neck pain, drowsiness/sedation, asthenia, fatigue) also are symptoms associated with migraine attacks and/or the postdromal period, it may be difficult to distinguish the effects of underlying disease processes from drug-induced effects. The most frequently reported adverse effects associated with intranasal sumatriptan include disturbances of taste, nausea or vomiting, and disease of nasal cavity or sinuses. For adverse effects reported with sumatriptan therapy in the Cautions section, a causal relationship to the drug has not always been established. In addition, the incidence of adverse effects reported in clinical trials may not predict precisely the likelihood of encountering these effects under usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those prevailing in the trials.",

Transient irritative symptoms (eg, burning, numbness, paresthesia, discharge, pain or soreness) were reported to be severe in about 1% of patients receiving intranasal sumatriptan; these symptoms generally resolved in less than 2 hours. Limited examination of the nose and throat did not reveal clinically noticeable injury in these patients. In addition, an increased incidence of local irritation has not been observed in patients receiving intranasal sumatriptan repeatedly for up to 1 year. However, epithelial hyperplasia (with and without keratinization) and squamous metaplasia were observed in the larynx of rats receiving inhaled sumatriptan daily for 1 month at dosages as low as one-half the maximum daily human exposure (based on dose per surface area of nasal cavity). In addition, evidence of epithelial hyperplasia, focal squamous metaplasia, granulomata, bronchitis, and fibrosing alveolitis was observed in the respiratory and nasal mucosa in dogs administered various formulations of sumatriptan by intranasal instillation daily for up to 13 weeks, at exposure rates of 2-4 times the maximum daily human exposure (based on dose per surface area of nasal cavity). The changes observed in both species are not considered to be signs of preneoplastic or neoplastic transformation. Local effects on nasal and respiratory tissues after chronic, repeated intranasal administration of sumatriptan have not been studied in animals or humans.",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

The drug also is absorbed rapidly following intranasal administration. The bioavailability of sumatriptan given subcutaneously is almost complete, averaging about 97% of that obtained with iv administration of the drug. The bioavailability of sumatriptan following oral or intranasal administration averages only about 15 or 17%, respectively, principally because of presystemic metabolism of the drug and in part because of incomplete absorption. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak serum concentration of sumatriptan increase linearly with single subcutaneous doses of 1-16 mg. The extent of sumatriptan absorption (AUC) also is dose-proportional following single oral doses of 25-200 mg; however, peak plasma concentrations after a 100-mg oral dose of sumatriptan are approximately 25% less than those predicted from a 25-mg oral dose.",

The 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors function as autoreceptors, activation of which leads to inhibition of firing of serotonin neurons and a reduction in the synthesis and release of serotonin. Upon binding to these 5-HT1 receptor subtypes, sumatriptan inhibits adenylate cyclase activity via regulatory G proteins, increases intracellular calcium, and affects other intracellular events that lead to vasoconstriction and inhibition of sensory nociceptive (trigeminal) nerve firing and vasoactive neuropeptide release. Sumatriptan has the highest affinity for the 5-HT1D receptor, the most common serotonin receptor subtype in the brain, and a 2- to 17-fold lower affinity for 5-HT1A receptors; agonist activity at 5-HT1A and other serotonin receptors may be responsible for some of the adverse effects noted with administration of serotonin or serotonergic antimigraine drugs (eg, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine). Sumatriptan has essentially no affinity for (based on standard radioligand binding assays) nor pharmacologic activity at other serotonin receptors (eg, 5-HT2, 5-HT3) or at receptors of the dopamine1, dopamine2, muscarinic, histamine, benzodiazepine, or alpha1-, alpha2-, or beta-adrenergic type.",

The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of migraine and cluster headache are not clearly understood; consequently, the precise mechanism of action of sumatriptan in the management of these disorders has not been established. However, current data suggest that sumatriptan may ameliorate migraine and cluster headache through selective constriction of certain large cranial blood vessels and/or inhibition of neurogenic inflammatory processes in the CNS. While some features of migraine clearly reflect effects on cerebral blood vessels, neurogenic mechanisms involving activation of the trigeminovascular system also have been implicated; current evidence suggests that both mechanisms may be involved.",

This results in vasoconstriction and inhibtion of sensory nociceptive (trigeminal) nerve firing and vasoactive neuropeptide release. Sumatriptan stimulates 5-HT receptors of the 1D subtype, most likely presynaptic receptors, resulting in selective vasoconstriction of inflamed and dilated cranial blood vessels in the carotid circulation. Sumatriptan also blocks the release of vasoactive neuropeptides from perivascular trigeminal axons in the dura mater during migraine and may inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators from the trigeminal nerve.",

It also has poor oral bioavailability, further decreasing infant exposure to the drug.

The manufacturer recommends withholding breastfeeding for 12 hours after a dose. Withholding breastfeeding might be helpful in extreme cases, such as in the mother of a preterm infant, but sumatriptan would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in most breastfed infants. Painful, burning nipples and breast pain have been reported after doses of sumatriptan and other triptans. This has occasionally been accompanied by a decrease in milk production.",

As of October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states people who are pregnant should not use NSAIDs (such as naproxen) after week 20 of pregnancy unless specifically advised to do so by their healthcare provider. For more information on naproxen, see our fact sheet at https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/naproxen/.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether. However, it is important to talk with your healthcare providers before making any changes to how you take your medication. Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

Under the conditions of this experiment, the result was a 2-fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration x time curve (AUC), corresponding to a 40% increase in elimination half-life. This interaction was not evident with an MAO-B inhibitor. A small study evaluating the effect of pretreatment with an MAO-A inhibitor on the bioavailability from a 25-mg oral sumatriptan tablet resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in systemic exposure.",

Intravenous access should be established and gastric lavage (after intubation, if patient is unconscious) and administration of activated charcoal together with a laxative should be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure, or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis.  Cardiovascular monitoring should commence immediately and should include continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. If antiarrhythmic therapy is administered, disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine carry a theoretical hazard of additive QT-prolonging effects that might be additive to those of ziprasidone.  Hypotension and circulatory collapse should be treated with appropriate measures such as intravenous fluids. If sympathomimetic agents are used for vascular support, epinephrine and dopamine should not be used, since beta stimulation combined with a1 antagonism associated with ziprasidone may worsen hypotension. Similarly, it is reasonable to expect that the alpha-adrenergic-blocking properties of bretylium might be additive to those of ziprasidone, resulting in problematic hypotension.  In cases of severe extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic medication should be administered. There is no specific antidote to ziprasidone, and it is not dialyzable. The possibility of multiple drug involvement should be considered. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.",

Drug concentrations in milk and plasma over the ensuing 8 hr were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean milk:plasma ratio estimated from the areas under the milk and plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) was 4.9 (95% CI 4.1-5.7), indicating a significant transfer of sumatriptan into the milk compartment. The mean total recovery of drug in milk was estimated to be only 14.4 ug (95% CI 6.1-22.7 ug), or 0.24% of the 6 mg administered dose. On a weight-adjusted basis this corresponded to a mean infant exposure of 3.5% of the maternal dose (95% CI 0.3-6.7%). If oral bioavailability in the infant is similar to that in adults (14%), the weight-adjusted infant dose is reduced to 0.49%. Furthermore, allowance for reduced clearance in the infant predicts an infant exposure varying from 4.9% in a very premature neonate to 0.7% in a 30 week old infant. Since sumatriptan is usually administered as a single dose at infrequent intervals, the low level of excretion in breast milk suggests that continued breast feeding following its use will not pose a significant risk to the suckling infant. Even this minor exposure could be largely avoided by expressing and discarding all milk for 8 hr after the dose.",

Its clinical presentation includes headaches, seizures and focal neurological deficits, which develop shortly after a normal pregnancy. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and angiography, showing multiple narrowing of the intracranial cerebral arteries. This neurological feature is reversible and the clinical outcome is good. We report a case of benign cerebral angiopathy in a 20-year-old woman in the postpartum period, occurring after administration of sumatriptan and ergot derivates.",

Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no-effect doses were not established; however, the relative exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 5 times the human exposure after a 100-mg oral dose. There is evidence of alterations in corneal appearance on the first day of intranasal dosing to dogs. Changes were noted at the lowest dose tested, which was approximately one half the maximum single human oral dose of 100 mg on a mg/sq m basis.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 7.1X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sumatriptan will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase sumatriptan will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Sumatriptan does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, sumatriptan is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 80. However, aromatic amines are expected to bind strongly to humus or organic matter in soils due to the high reactivity of the aromatic amino group, suggesting that mobility may be much lower in some soils. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.6X10-14 atm-cu m/mole. Sumatriptan may not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, sumatriptan is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to sumatriptan may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sumatriptan is produced or used. Use data indicate that exposure may be limited to those administered this drug in the treatment of migraines. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Drug concentrations in milk and plasma over the ensuing 8 hr were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean milk:plasma ratio estimated from the areas under the milk and plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) was 4.9 (95% CI 4.1-5.7), indicating a significant transfer of sumatriptan into the milk compartment. The mean total recovery of drug in milk was estimated to be only 14.4 ug (95% CI 6.1-22.7 ug), or 0.24% of the 6 mg administered dose. On a weight-adjusted basis this corresponded to a mean infant exposure of 3.5% of the maternal dose (95% CI 0.3-6.7%). If oral bioavailability in the infant is similar to that in adults (14%), the weight-adjusted infant dose is reduced to 0.49%. Furthermore, allowance for reduced clearance in the infant predicts an infant exposure varying from 4.9% in a very premature neonate to 0.7% in a 30 week old infant. Since sumatriptan is usually administered as a single dose at infrequent intervals, the low level of excretion in breast milk suggests that continued breast feeding following its use will not pose a significant risk to the suckling infant.

This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic.

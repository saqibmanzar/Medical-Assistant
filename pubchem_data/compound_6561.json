Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Isobutyraldehyde is also emitted into the atmosphere by combustion sources. Isobutyraldehyde occurs naturally in foods; it is also emitted into the atmosphere by plants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 173 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isobutyraldehyde will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isobutyraldehyde will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14.6 hrs. Isobutyraldehyde may also be degraded in the atmosphere by direct photolysis, half-lives of 2.5 and 3.3 hr at respective solar zenith angles of 30 and 58 deg were determined. If released to soil, isobutyraldehyde is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 8. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Isobutyraldehyde may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, isobutyraldehyde is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Isobutyraldehyde, present at 100 mg/l, reached 81% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.6 hrs and 4.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Isobutyraldehyde is not expected to chemically hydrolyze in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups. Occupational exposure to isobutyraldehyde may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isobutyraldehyde is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isobutryaldehyde through consumption of food (since it occurs naturally in many foods) and consumption of drinking water.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 173 mm Hg(4), and its water solubility(2). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.6 hrs and 4.6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 1(SRC), from its water solubility(2) and a regression-derived equation(3), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Isobutyraldehyde, present at 100 mg/l, reached 81% of its theoretical BOD in 2 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(6).",

Vapor-phase isobutyraldehyde is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 14.6 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.6X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Based upon direct photolysis measurements, the direct photolysis rate constants of isobutyraldehyde at solar zenith angles of 30 and 58 deg were determined to be 7.6X10-5 and 5.9X10-5 /sec(4), respectively, which correspond to respective half-lives of 2.5 and 3.3 hr(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 14.6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Isobutyraldehyde is not expected to chemically hydrolyze in the environment due to the lack of hydrolyzable functional groups(2). Based upon direct photolysis measurements, the direct photolysis rate constants of isobutyraldehyde at solar zenith angles of 30 and 58 deg were determined to be 7.6X10-5 and 5.9X10-5 /sec(3), respectively, which correspond to respective half-lives of 2.5 and 3.3 hr(SRC). Carbon monoxide is one of the products formed from atmospheric photolysis and OH reaction with isobutyraldehyde(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that isobutyraldehyde is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 3.6 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 4.6 days(SRC). Isobutyraldehyde's estimated Henry's Law constant(1,2) indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).

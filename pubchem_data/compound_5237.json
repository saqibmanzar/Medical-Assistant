The use of 2-(13)C-, 1,2-(13)C-, and 1,2-(14)C-fluoroacetate, ... reveals a complex mixture of urinary metabolites including an S-(carboxymethyl) conjugate complex in rats and mice and sulfoxidation products... in rats. ...Bile, following treatment with 2-(13)C- fluoroacetate, shows the presence of S-(carboxymethyl)glutathione or a related conjugate and an O-conjugate of fluoroacetate. Incubation of (13)C-fluoroacetate with rat and mouse liver cytosol involves formation of S-((13)C-carboxymethyl) glutathione and fluoride ion. Fluorocitrate is also /detected in/ fluoroacetate incubations with mouse liver cytosol. Fluoroacetamide administered ip to rats and mice yields urinary fluoride ion formed via fluoroacetate which is liberated on hydrolysis by an organophosphate-sensitive amidase. (19)F NMR... of other metabolites of fluoroacetamide are consistent with fluoroacetohydroxamic acid in the liver of mice and fluorocitrate in the urine of rats. Fluoroethanol gives urinary fluoroacetate and fluoride ion in rats and mice and is converted to fluoroacetaldehyde by mouse and rat liver microsomes. (-)- and (+)-erythro- fluorocitrates administered ip to rats yield mostly the parent compounds in urine at 6 hr with increasing amounts of fluoride ion thereafter. ...Rat and mouse liver cytosols defluorinate (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate. Metabolic defluorination and pig heart aconitase also defluorinates (-)-erythro- fluorocitrate. Metabolic defluorination of fluoroacetate and its progenitors, fluoroacetamide and fluoroethanol, is therefore attributable to both conjugation of fluoroacetate with glutathione and conversion to (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate, which is both an inhibitor of and a substrate for aconitase. ...Urine of rats and mice poisoned with fluoroacetate or (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate show elevated citrate and glucose and diminished urea consistent with disruptions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and ammonia metabolism.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Other species in Brazil including some species traditionally assigned to Mascagnia but now properly called Amorimia species and other Palicourea species are reported to cause sudden death in livestock and are suspected to contain MFA due to the similarity of clinical signs. In this study, an HPLC-APCI-MS method to detect and quantify MFA was developed and was used to investigate plant material from field collections and/or herbarium specimens of Mascagnia, Amorimia, and Palicourea species suspected of causing sudden death. MFA was detected in Amorimia amazonica, Amorimia camporum, Amorimia exotropica, Amorimia pubiflora, Amorimia rigida, and Amorimia septentrionalis as well as Palicourea aeneofusca. MFA concentrations differ greatly between Palicourea species and Amorimia species, which may explain the incidence of poisoning and the amount of plant material required to cause sudden death between these taxa.",

Urine is one of the most typical specimens for forensic diagnosis when poisoning case about FAcOH happens. The positive sample containing FAcOH plays a key role for the development of an accurate and reliable analytical method. The bioconversion from monofluoroacetamide (FAcNH2) to FAcOH in urine in vitro was studied for the preparation of positive urine sample containing FAcOH without standard spiking or animal experiment. The average bioconversion rates were 0%, 18.6% and 41.3% when incubated the FAcNH2 spiked urine in vitro for 21 days at -20 \u00b0C, room temperature (RT) and 37 \u00b0C, respectively. Afterwards, a fast and sensitive analytical method was developed for determination of FAcOH in urine. Samples were diluted with water containing formic acid and cleaned with polymeric anion exchange (PAX) cartridge. The acid eluate was neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and directly measured by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using basic mobile phase condition. The limit of detection and limit of quantification of FAcOH in urine were 2 and 5 ng/mL, respectively. The linear range was 5-1000 ng/mL with a correlation coefficient of r=0.9993 in urine calibrated with internal standard. The recoveries at four spiking levels (5, 10, 50 and 500 ng/mL in urine) were 87.2%-107% with relative standard deviations ranged between 4.3%-8.8%.",

For intentional and unintentional misuses, the incidence of FAcOH poisoning has increased in recent years. Organic fluorine rodenticides such as sodium monofluoroacetate and monofluoroacetamide, the analogs of FAcOH, can easily be converted to FAcOH in vivo and cause injury. It is urgent to establish a simple and sensitive analytical method of FAcOH in human plasma and applied to clinical poison analysis. In this paper, an ultra-fast liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS/MS) method was developed for determination of FAcOH in patient plasma. We used isotopic labelled FAcOH-13C2, D2 as the internal standard (IS). Plasma samples were simply precipitated with acetonitrile and the supernatant was injected directly for analysis. The chromatographic column was Phenomenex Luna Silica column (100 x 2 mm, 3 um), FAcOH was eluted by isocratic elution with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water contains 5 mM ammonium formate with 0.2% formic acid. The retention time of FAcOH was 2.31 minA good linear response was from 0.25 to 200 ug/mL, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.9980. The limit of detection was 0.05 ug/mL. The recoveries at three spiking levers were 89.51-93.03% with relative standard deviations ranged between 2.55-3.61%. This new method has been successfully applied to monitor 31 cases of patients suspected with sodium monofluoroacetate or monofluoroacetamide poisoning.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Carboxylic acids donate hydrogen ions if a base is present to accept them. They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

It was used formerly in the production of the highly toxic rodenticide and general mammalian pest control agent sodium fluoroacetic acid. HUMAN STUDIES: Estimates of the lethal dose of fluoroacetate in humans lie in the range of 2 to 10 mg/kg. In the case of chronic human poisoning, a rabbit exterminator in New Zealand was exposed repeatedly during preparation of fluoroacetate bait over a period of 10 years. He presented with severe and progressive lesions of the renal tubular epithelium and with milder hepatic, neurologic and thyroid dysfunctions. In another case, symptoms of poisoning in a chemist began after latent period of 0.5 to several hr followed rapidly by death. Convulsions and arrhythmia were common terminal signs. No specific changes were noted at post mortem. Fluoroacetic ion alone is non-toxic but in vivo forms fluorotricarboxylic acid, which blocks cellular metabolism at the citrate stage. Symptoms occur with a delay but lethal synthesis of fluorotricarboxylic acid leads to the irreversible cellular dysfunction, especially in CNS and circulatory system. Poisoning may be treated with monoacetin and acetamide. ANIMAL STUDIES: Administration of 1.0-1.5 mg/kg of fluoroacetate decreased dentin formation and enamel calcification in rats. Hypothermic activity of fluoroacetic acid 1.5-60 mg/kg, ip in rats was closely related to its lethal effect. Rats were more sensitive than mice. Administration of 6 mg/kg ip to rats progressively depleted ATP content, AMP and ADP levels increased during initial 2 hr and later declined. 4.5-15 ug/kg/min fluoroacetate administration into dogs left renal artery for 90-240 min sharply increased unilateral diuresis, with increased excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, chlorides and inorganic phosphates due to decreased reabsorption. Similar changes observed after 37-936 ug/kg iv administration. Fluoroacetic acid toxicity is often characterized by seizures. In cats intravenously injected with fluoroacetate at 0.03 mmol/kg the ionized calcium level in blood fell by an average of 27.2%, 40 minutes after injection. There was a corresponding prolongation of the QT interval of the electrocardiogram. Many plants worldwide contain monofluoroacetate and cause sudden death in livestock. These plants are primarily found in the southern continents of Africa, Australia, and South America, where they negatively affect livestock production. In goats, the main clinical signs were motor incoordination, generalized muscle tremors, broad-based posture, tachypnea, tachycardia, vocalization and respiratory distress. Two goats died 5 and 20 min after the observation of the first clinical signs. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, fluoroacetic acid added to the growth medium reduced reproduction in the second generation by 50% at concentrations 3,000 times lower than the concentrations that reduced 24-hour survival by 50%.",

Fluoroacetate disrupts the citric acid cycle by combining with coenzyme A to form fluoroacetyl CoA. Fluoroacetyl CoA then reacts with citrate synthase to produce fluorocitrate. A metabolite of fluorocitrate binds very tightly to aconitase, thereby halting the citric acid cycle. This inhibition results in an accumulation of citrate in the blood which deprives cells of energy. (L1713) (A2849) (A2850)",

If a delay of more than 60 minutes is expected before charcoal can be given, consider using ipecac to induce vomiting if it can be administered within a few minutes of exposure and there are no contraindications. Hospital: Immediately administer activated charcoal. Consider gastric lavage if it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.

In this study, /investigators/ discovered it to be a potent and specific inhibitor of reproduction in a bioassay using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Fluoroacetic acid added to the growth medium reduced reproduction in the second generation by 50% at concentrations 3,000 times lower than the concentrations that reduced 24-hour survival by 50%. Four concentrations (2, 4, 8, and 17 mM) of fluoroacetic acid were tested thoroughly. At the two lower concentrations, the survival rates were unaffected, and first-generation reproduction was greatly reduced but not completely eliminated. Survival was reduced at the higher concentrations. Malonate, which inhibits the Krebs cycle, and itaconate, which inhibits the glyoxylate cycle, were tested individually and in combination. The combination did not specifically inhibit reproduction, suggesting another mode of action for fluoroacetic acid. ...",

Its former use as a rodenticide resulted in its direct release to the environment. Fluoroacetic acid occurs naturally as a constituent of many poisonous plants. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates fluoroacetic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase fluoroacetic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 27 days. Fluoroacetic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, fluoroacetic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.4. The pKa of fluoroacetic acid is 2.59, indicating that this compound will exist almost entirely in the anion form in the environment and anions generally do not adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Fluoroacetic acid may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Fluoracetic acid has been identified as potentially removed by biological sewage treatment provided suitable acclimatization can be achieved, suggesting that the compound may be subject to biodegradation in terrestrial or aquatic systems. If released into water, fluoroacetic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. The pKa value indicates fluoroacetic acid will exist almost entirely in the anion form at pH values of 5 to 9 and, therefore, volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to fluoroacetic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sodium fluoroacetic acid is produced or used. General population exposure should be low or non-existent since the pesticide use of the sodium salt of fluoroacetic acid is prohibited in the US. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 27 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The neutral, aqueous hydrolysis rate constant of fluoroacetic acid was experimentally determined to be <1.7X10-6/hr at pH 7 which corresponds to a half-life of >47 years(2). Fluoroacetic acid does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(3) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). Using a 1000-W xenon arc lamp and addition of 1 mmol/L ferric iron, fluoroacetic acid was substantially degraded in 20 minutes(4). Haloacetates can be degraded by iron-catalyzed direct photodecarboxylation or photolytic generation of hydroxyl radicals with subsequent reaction with the haloacetate(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

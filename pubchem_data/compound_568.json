ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Dibenzosuberenone showed minor differences in selectivity, with IC50 values of 10 and 30 microM for HRV16 and HRV14 cytopathy, respectively.

With the exception of acridine, which showed a strong binding to the test soil and a subsequent low toxicity, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and neutral N-, S-, O-monosubstituted analogues showed a similar toxicity to the enchytraeids. Concentrations estimated to give a 10% reduction of reproductive output (EC10 values) were based on measured initial concentrations and were, for acridine, 310 mg/kg; for carbazole, 19 mg/kg; for dibenzofuran, 36 mg/kg, for dibenzothiophene, 40 and 45 mg/kg (two tests); for fluoranthene, 15 mg/kg; for fluorene, 25 mg/kg; for phenanthrene, 40 mg/kg; and for pyrene, 11 mg/kg.",

With the exception of acridine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and neutral N-, S-, and O-monosubstituted analogues showed similar toxicities to soil collembolans when the results were expressed in relation to total soil concentrations (mg/kg). The estimated concentrations resulting in a 10% reduction of reproductive output (EC10 values) were based on measured initial concentrations and were for acridine 290 mg/kg, carbazole 10 mg/kg, dibenzofuran 19 mg/kg, dibenzothiophene 7.8 mg/kg, fluoranthene 37 mg/kg, fluorene 7.7 mg/kg, phenantrene 23 mg/kg, and pyrene 10 mg/kg. When the EC10 values were converted to soil pore-water concentrations, they showed a highly significant correlation (r2 = 0.71, p < 0.01) to no-observed-effect concentrations for the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna, as estimated by a quantitative structure activity relation (QSAR) for baseline toxicity (nonpolar narcosis). Only carbazole and acridine were more than two times more toxic (4.9 and 3.1, respectively) than expected from the Daphnia QSAR data.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.00248 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenzofuran will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase dibenzofuran will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days. Dibenzofuran absorbs little UV light above 300nm, but UV absorption rises sharply below 300 nm which indicates the potential for direct photolysis in the environment. If released to soil, dibenzofuran is expected to have slight mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4,200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Indigenous soil microorganisms at contaminated sites can degrade dibenzofuran if stimulated. At a creosote-contaminated site, the concn of dibenzofuran (mean at 8 locations, 652 mg/kg) was reduced by an avg of 83% in 4 months. If released into water, dibenzofuran is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Biodegradation screening tests indicate that dibenzofuran is not readily biodegradable. However in laboratory studies, dibenzofuran was degraded in a few days using subsurface materials which had been contaminated by creosote chemicals. Once microbial adaptation had occurred, dibenzofuran rapidly biotransformed under aerobic conditions. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 7 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment. BCF values for fish of 524 to 947 are high and from 1,100 to 2,420 are very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dibenzofuran may occur through inhalation and dermal, particularly at sites where coal tar, coal tar derivatives, and creosote is produced or used (e.g., the handling of creosote-treated wood). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenzofuran via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with wood products containing dibenzofuran. (SRC)",

Dibenzofuran is a component of coal tar (mainly in the wash or creosote oil fraction in the primary distillation of coal tar) which is made into creosote which is widely used as a wood preservative(2,3). Dibenzofuran may be present in emissions from creosote-treated wood(SRC). Dibenzofuran may be released in wastewater, solid waste, and emissions at wood preserving facilities, coking oven, and other facilities that produce or use coal tar and coal tar products(SRC). Leachates from commercial coal tar contain dibenzofuran(4). Sources of dibenzofuran release to the atmosphere include the combustion of coal, biomass, refuse, diesel fuel, and residual oil, coal gasification, and tobacco smoke(5-8).",

Volatilization of dibenzofuran from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.00248 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 3.1 mg/l(5). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Dibenzofuran is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(4). Photoreactor studies indicate that photodegradation may occur in surface soil but degradation rates appear to be slow(6). Screening tests in water indicate that dibenzofuran is not likely to be readily biodegradable(SRC). Dibenzofuran, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(7). However, indigenous soil microorganisms at contaminated sites can degrade dibenzofuran if stimulated(8,9). At a creosote-contaminated site, the concn of dibenzofuran at 8 locations (mean, 652 mg/kg) was reduced by an avg of 83% in 4 months(9).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.00248 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 3.1 mg/l(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 7 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 82 days if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), BCF values for fish of 524 to 947(5,8) are high and from 1,100 to 2,420(5,8,9) are very high(SRC). However, rapid elimination of dibenzofuran would reduce the BCF potential(SRC). Over 97% of the accumulated dibenzofuran was eliminated in 2 days during depuration tests in fathead minnow(10). Screening tests indicate that dibenzofuran is not readily biodegradable(SRC). Dibenzofuran, present at 100 mg/l, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/l and the Japanese MITI test(8). However, dibenzofuran was degraded in a few days in laboratory studies using subsurface materials which had been contaminated by creosote chemicals(11). The rate of dibenzofuran degradation in studies using pristine subsurface materials was relatively slow and not much faster than in autoclaved controls, 3.9% per week(11). Restriction of oxygen supply in the non-sterile experiments significantly lowered the degradation rate(11). Once microbial adaptation had occurred, dibenzofuran rapidly biotransformed as long as an adequate oxygen supply was present(11).",

However, a small fraction (about 2.4%) exists in the particulate phase(3-5). Vapor-phase dibenzofuran is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.9X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(6). For particle-associated dibenzofuran, the dominant tropospheric removal processes are expected to be wet and dry deposition; a tropospheric lifetime of >10 days is expected which is sufficient for long-range transport to occur(7). Rainwater monitoring indicates that both vapor-phase and particulate dibenzofuran are removed from air via wet deposition(3,4). Washout ratios (concn in rainwater/concn in air) are approximately 1000(5). Dibenzofuran absorbs little UV light above 300nm, but UV absorption rises sharply below 300 nm(7), indicating a potential for direct photolysis in the atmosphere(SRC).",

The  rate of dibenzofuran degradation in studies using pristine subsurface materials was relatively  slow and not much faster than in autoclaved controls, 3.9% per week(1). Restriction of oxygen  supply in the non-sterile experiments significantly lowered the degradation rate(1). Once  microbial adaptation had occurred, dibenzofuran rapidly biotransformed as long as an adequate  oxygen supply was present(1). In a laboratory study, factors affecting the biodegradation of  polynuclear aromatics in creosote-contaminated groundwater (Conroe, TX) were examined(2). The  results under specific experimental conditions were (conditions, biodegradation rate, percent  removal): nutrient and dissolved oxygen addition, 57%/wk, 100%; dissolved oxygen addition,  37%/wk, 94%; oxygen limited, 11%/wk, 12%; sterile control, 0%/wk, 0%(2). Groundwater from a  moderately contaminated well was sparged with nitrogen to see the effect of dissolved  oxygen(2); at high (9.0 mg/l) and low (1.8 mg/l) dissolved oxygen, the biotransformation rate  was 65.4%/ day and 39.5%/ day, respectively(2). Dibenzofuran degraded in creosote-contaminated  groundwater at a rate of 18.2-50%/wk with a 1-3 day lag(3). Degradation at an uncontaminated  site was 12.3%/week with a 6 day lag. Degradation was faster in the more highly contaminated  groundwater(3). Dibenzofuran degraded in 5 days (3 day lag period) in single substrate batch  experiments conducted at 10 \u00b0C at pH 7 using groundwater (without aquifer material) from an  oil-contaminated site in Denmark(4). In an analogous experiment using a mixed substrate of  selected nitrogen-and oxygen-containing aromatic compounds, dibenzofuran degraded in 14.5 days  (13 day lag period)(4). When dibenzofuran was aerobically incubated with groundwater from the  periphery of a plume of contamination from creosote, 38% degradation occurred in one week;  dibenzofuran was not detected after 2 weeks(5). In shake flask studies of the biodegradation  of creosote components by indigenous microorganisms in contaminated groundwater at a Superfund  site in Pensacola, FL, 38% and 87% dibenzofuran loss was found after 5 and 14 days incubation,  respectively(6). In a study using aerobic groundwater microcosms, dibenzofuran at 3.3 mg/l  degraded completely after 278 days (lag period = 118 days) from an aquifer contaminated with  creosote compounds while from a background aquifer, benzofuran degraded after 42 days (lag  period = 29 days)(7).",

In laboratory studies of the biodegradation creosote constituents in soil from a abandoned wood-preserving facility in Pensacola, FL, 76% of dibenzofuran degraded in 1 week of incubation at 23 \u00b0C in special landfarming chambers(2). Analogous experiments performed with sediment resulted in 31% degradation in 12 weeks. Soil amendation did not have a marked effect of degradation(2). The reason suggested for the much slower degradation in sediment was the higher concn (190 times higher) and anaerobic source of the microorganisms in the sediment(2).",

Vapor-phase reaction of dibenzofuran with ozone and nitrate radicals  result in atmospheric half-lives of >142 days and >4.9 years, respectively(1), which are  negligible compared with the reaction of dibenzofuran with hydroxyl radicals(SRC).  Dibenzofuran absorbs little UV light above 300 nm, but UV absorption rises sharply below 300  nm(2), indicating a potential for direct photolysis in the environment(SRC). Soil studies  indicate that there may be significant degradation in soil that are attributable to  photochemical reactions(2). Reaction rates determined for some systems indicate that  half-lives are of the order of months(2). The soil itself was more of a determinant of  photoreactivity than amendments in the soil; reactivity was related to soil color and surface  reflectance(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

According to a classification scheme(3), this estimated Koc  value suggests that dibenzofuran is expected to have slight mobility in soil(SRC). Monitoring  of dibenzofuran in contaminated groundwater beneath an abandoned creosote facility in Conroe,  TX has suggested that leaching of dibenzofuran may be much more important than predicted from  estimation methods, although soil from this location had a very low organic content and other  co-contaminants present(4). Sorption of creosote compounds (including dibenzofuran) were  measured on natural clayey till soil column(5); a Kd of 4.31 l/kg was measured for  dibenzofuran (in the presence of other creosote compounds)(5).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that dibenzofuran is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(3). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 7 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 82 days if adsorption is considered(4). Dibenzofuran's estimated Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). However, volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to soil(SRC). Dibenzofuran is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon its vapor pressure(1).",

Similar monitoring beneath a wood-preserving facility in Pensacola, FL found levels of 0.01-0.49 ppm(2). Another study at the Pensacola site found that the concn of dibenzofuran in ground water (6.1 m deep wells) in the sand and gravel aquifer with down-gradient distance from a surface impoundment was (distance from source, concn): 6 m, 0.30 mg/l; 53 m, 0.04 mg/l; 99 m, 0.16 mg/l; 122 m, <0.10 mg/l; 150 m, <0.10 mg/l(3). Another investigator found that the dibenzofuran concn at the well 6 m from the contamination source was 0.62 mg/l at 6.1 m depth and the concn at the well 53 m from the source was 0.31, 0.19 and 0.27 mg/l at a depth of 3.3, 5.8, and 11.0 m, respectively(4). It should be noted that a less permeable silt-clay layer extends into the sand aquifer between 6 and 15 m depth. Dibenzofuran was detected, but not quantified, in upper level groundwater beneath a coal-tar distillation facility in St. Louis Park, MN(5). Dibenzofuran was detected in groundwater at 3 creosote-contaminated sites in Denmark with concns ranging from not detected (detection limit = 0.05 ug/l) to 31 ug/l(6).",

It was found in sediment from 2 of 5 Great Lakes tributaries at concns of 1.70 and 9.50 ppm(2). Concns detected in sediments  from various sites of a Norwegian fjord receiving industrial effluents ranged  from 6.7 to 918.7 ppb dry wt(3). Sediments collected from Lake Pontchartrain  in LA in 1980 contained levels of 1.9 ppb dry wt(4). Concns in sediments from  Eagle Harbor (near Puget Sound, WA) in 1983, which had been receiving  creosote effluents, ranged from 31 to 3600 ug/kg(5). One of 4 sediment  samples and none of the 5 soil samples collected in the vicinity of a manufacturing plant in Czechoslovakia that processes crude tar contained  dibenzofuran (detection limit = 50 ng/g)(6). The concn in the positive sediment sample was 1315.8 ng/g(6). It was detected in Black River Sediment  near Lorain, OH, the site of a coking plant associated with a steel mill(7).  In sediment samples taken from Lake Michigan (between 1991-1993), the concn  of dibenzofuran ranged from 9.59 to 41.25 ng/g dry wt(8). The concns of  dibenzofuran in sediment cores in northern New Jersey waterways were  (waterway, frequency of detection, median using half of detection limit as  concn in samples where substance was not detected (ppm), maximum detected  (ppm)): Arthur Kill (n=24), 21%, 0.65, 6.0; Hackensack River (n=12), 17%,  0.58, 0.45; Kill Van Kull (n=12), 0%, 0.44, -; Newark Bay (n=45), 7%, 0.60,  13; Passaic River (n=95), 0.3%, 0.65, 74(9). The frequencies of detection and  medians must be treated with caution due, in part, to the high variability in  detection limits (as high as 57 ppm for one sample) which were attributed to matrix effects in the highly contaminated sediment (9). Sediment collected from Georges Bank (off Martha's Vineyard, MA) in 1982 had dibenzofuran levels of 0.94 ug/kg(10). Dibenzofuran was detected, but not quantified in Kondo Bay, Japan, a body of water that received untreated industrial and municipal waste(11).",

The concn of dibenzofuran in the gas-phase in the ambient air of Portland, OR in Feb-Apr 1984 ranged from 13 to 25 ng/cu m(2); the particulate phase concn ranged from  0 to 0.35 ng/cu m(3). The mean concns of dibenzofuran in the gas and particulate phases in Portland were 19 and 0.1 ng/cu m, respectively indicating that only 2.4% of the dibenzofuran was attached to particles(4). A 24-hr air sample collected in December, 1986 in Whitehorse, Yukon contained 2 ppm of dibenzofuran(5).",

Occupational exposure to dibenzofuran may occur through inhalation and dermal contact, particularly at sites where coal tar, coal tar derivatives, and creosote are produced and used (e.g., the handling of creosote-treated wood)(2,3). Approximately 4,000 workers in the US were employed at facilities that used creosote as a wood preservative in the late 70s, including an estimated 100 workers employed in commercial thermal and dip treatment operations(3). The workplace air in a carbon-paste plant in Norway was found to contain a dibenzofuran particulate concn of 0.7-1.8 ug/cu m(4). Monitoring of the workplace air in an aluminum reduction plant in Norway found gas-phase dibenzofuran levels of 0.44-61.0 ug/cu m and particulate phase levels of 0.02-0.14 ug/cu m(5). Only cleaning chamber workers (n=3) were exposed to detectable levels of dibenzofuran at a Finnish wood impregnation plant, 0.7 mg/cu m(6). Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenzofuran via inhalation of ambient air and dermal contact with wood products containing dibenzofuran(SRC).",

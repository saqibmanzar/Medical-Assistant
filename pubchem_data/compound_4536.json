PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

In one study, women who received the implant at 6 days postpartum, a transient decrease in milk protein occurred 2 weeks after implant insertion. A decrease in milk phosphorus content was also observed between 2 and 4 months after implant insertion in this group and at 3 months postpartum, the early insertion group had a higher rate of supplementation. In another study, women given norethindrone enanthate depot injection less than 48 hours postpartum were 2.5 to 3 times more likely to have postpartum depression at 6 weeks postpartum.

Women who intended to breastfeed for at least 4 months and were taking a progestin-only oral contraceptive, such as norethindrone, were 3.15 times more likely to be breastfeeding (exclusive or nonexclusive) at 4 months than women who used a nonhormonal contraceptive. Women who said they would breastfeed for 3 to 4 months had 4-month breastfeeding rates equivalent to those using a nonhormonal contraceptive. These rates were much higher than those of women who were taking an estrogen-containing, combined oral contraceptive.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The results showed that body weights of the 2916 and 5248 ppm groups were consistently decreased (10-13%) in males from week 3 to the end of the study. The decrease was statistically significant. Food consumption, and hematological parameters were similar to those of the controls. Clinical signs were not seen in the treated or control rats. There was a decrease in the aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) activity in both males and females at 5248 ppm on the 21 day examination period, but by 90 day examination period the SGOT values of 5248 ppm animals were similar to those of the controls. The alkaline phosphatase level was slightly increased in both males and females of 5248 ppm groups, but no statistical significance was found. At sacrifice, liver weights of the 2916 and 5248 ppm females were slightly increased. No gross pathology and histological changes were observed. The LOAEL of this study was 2916 ppm (292 mg/kg/day, based on 1 ppm=0.1 mg/kg/day) based on decreased in body weights; the NOAEL was 1620 ppm (162 mg/kg/day).",

In the 6-month feeding study in dogs, groups of beagle dogs (4/sex/dose; 8-10 weeks old) received TFM (85.6%) in the diet at concentrations of 300, 1250, or 5000 ppm for 6 months. The controls (4/sex) received 2% corn oil by weight. The results showed that a decrease in body weights was seen in both males (12-15%) and females (8-16%) of the 5000 ppm level beginning at 10 weeks. The body weight gains in these dogs were also decreased. Food consumption and food efficiency in 5000 ppm males and females also decreased, but not markedly. Clinical signs, hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis values were similar between the control and the treated animals. No treatment-related changes in organ weight were seen in any treatment groups. Treatment-related gross and histological changes were not found in TFM treated dogs. Under the conditions of this study, the LOAEL was 5000 ppm (125 mg/kg/day; based on 1 ppm =0.025 mg/kg/day) based on decreases in body weights and body weight gains; the NOAEL was 1250 ppm (31.25 mg/kg/day)."

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.3X10-3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, indicates that 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 days. 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol undergoes photolysis in aqueous solutions, and may be subject to photodegradation in the air. 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol is a weak acid with pKa of 6.07, indicating that it will partially exist as an anion under environmental conditions, and there is a correlation between pH and the soil adsorption properties of 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol. Koc values in the range of 224-390 at pH 6, and 38-52 at pH 8, indicates that 3-trifluoro-methyl-4-nitro- phenol is expected to possess moderate mobility in soil under acidic conditions and high to very high mobility under alkaline conditions. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since anions do not volatilize, and the estimated Henry's Law constant of the neutral species is 1.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole. Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected based upon the estimated vapor pressure. The biodegradation half-life of 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was under 1 week, with 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenol observed as the primary degradation product. If released into water, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in the water column in acidic waters, but is not expected to adsorb under alkaline conditions given the range of Koc values measured as a function of pH. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since anions do not volatilize and given the estimated Henry's Law constant for the neutral species. 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7, and 9; however, it may be susceptible to photolysis in surface water. 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol photodegraded in unbuffered distilled water when exposed to natural sunlight conditions with a half-life of 3.3 days. Occupational exposure to 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol may occur through inhalation of dust and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where it is produced or used. (SRC)",

The Henry's Law constant for the free acid (neutral species) is estimated as 1.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on the Henry's Law constant for the neutral species of 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol and the fact that anions do not volatilize(SRC). Volatilization from dry soil surfaces is not expected(SRC), based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 1.3X10-3 mm Hg determined from a fragment constant method(5).

The Henry's Law constant for the free acid (neutral species) is estimated as 1.9X10-8 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important environmental fate process based on the Henry's Law constant for the neutral species of 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol and the fact that anions do not volatilize(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), a BCF of 8.4 measured in rainbow trout(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The biodegradation half-life of 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was under 1 week, with 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenol observed as the primary degradation product(2). 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol is stable to hydrolysis at pH 5, 7, and 9; however, photolysis may be an important environmental fate process(2). 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol photodegraded in unbuffered distilled water under natural sunlight with a half-life of 3.3 days(2).",

Vapor-phase 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 21 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 7.7X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). 3-Trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol undergoes photolysis in aqueous solutions (4), and may be subject to photolysis in the air(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

Maximum BCF values of 50.3 for viscera, 1.3 for fillet, and 8.4 for whole body tissues were measured for rainbow trout that were exposed to nonradiolabeled plus uniformly phenyl ring-labeled C-14 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol, at a nominal concentration of 62.0 ug/L, under flow-through aquarium conditions at a pH of 7.8(1).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

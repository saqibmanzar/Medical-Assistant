Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 60.4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isopropyl acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase isopropyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere with an estimated half-life of 4.6 days by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals. If released to soil, isopropyl acetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 15. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.78X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of isopropyl acetate from dry soil surfaces may exist based on a vapor pressure of 60.4 mm Hg. If released into water, isopropyl acetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based on the estimated Koc. Isopropyl acetate was determined to have a 5 day BOD of 61% using a settled domestic wastewater seed, and BOD's of 72%, 74% and 76% after 10, 15 and 20 days, respectively. When the same inoculum was added to synthetic sea water, the 5, 10, 15 and 20 day BOD's were 14%, 39%, 43%, 49%, respectively. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based on its Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6 hours and 5 days, respectively. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 9.1X10-2 L/mol-sec was estimated using a structure estimation method; this corresponds to half-lives of 2.4 years and 88 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. An estimated BCF of 2 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to isopropyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isopropyl acetate is produced or used. The general population will be exposed to isopropyl acetate via inhalation of ambient air and volatiles of grape juice, nectarines, apples and milk, ingestion of drinking water, and dermal contact with vapors, food and other products containing isopropyl acetate.

A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 9.1X10-2 L/mol-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 2.4 years and 88 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2,SRC). An experimental rate constant for the aqueous reaction of isopropyl acetate with peroxy radicals at 30 \u00b0C has been determined to be 2.4X10-3 l/mole-sec(3); this corresponds to a half-life of greater than 9000 years(SRC) using an oxidant concn of 1X10-9 mole/l(4). The atmospheric photo-oxidation potential of isopropyl acetate, based on a 5 tiered rating system and determined in smog chamber studies, was assigned as Class II, low reactivity(5). This ranking system assigns compounds with negligible reactivity, such as methane, as class I and highly reactive dienes as class V(5). The relative rate for the photo-oxidation of isopropyl acetate in a smog chamber was 0.4 times less reactive than toluene(6).",

                                "Description": "Sorption to soils and sediments is an important factor on the transport and fate of organic contaminants in the environment.  The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

It is a resource for basic information about chemicals, biological organisms, and other substances of interest to EPA and its state and tribal partners. SRS makes it possible to identify which EPA data systems, environmental statutes, or other sources have information about a substance and which synonym is used by that system or statute.",

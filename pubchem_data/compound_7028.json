ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Caregivers noted historical details and the degree of apparent ear pain, drowsiness, and excitability with ascent and descent. Ninety-one flights involving 50 children were studied, with ear pain being reported in 13 (14%) of flights. Ear pain was not associated with a history of air travel-associated ear pain, recent ear infection, or recent upper airway symptoms. Pseudoephedrine use was not associated with a decrease in ear pain during either ascent (4% with pseudoephedrine vs 5% with placebo; P approximately 1.00) or descent (12% with pseudoephedrine vs. 13% with placebo; P approximately 1.00). Pseudoephedrine use was, however, linked to drowsiness at takeoff (60% with pseudoephedrine vs. 27% with placebo; P = .003) but not at landing (P = .39). Treatment was not associated with excitability at takeoff (P = .09) or landing (P approximately 1.00). Ear pain is not uncommon in children traveling by commercial aircraft. The predeparture use of pseudoephedrine does not decrease the risk for in-flight ear pain in children but is associated with drowsiness. /Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride/",

This pharmaceutical coding system divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and chemical characteristics. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

At pH 1.2, there was no difference in dissolution between the formulations. At pH 7.2, release rates correlated with the viscosity grade of sodium alginate. Bioavailability tests confirmed that capsules containing high viscosity grades of alginate led to slow release, with a time to reach peak concn of 6.5 hr, and no loss of amount of drug absorbed. It was concluded that controlled release pseudoephedrine capsules can be prepared with high viscosity grades of sodium alginate. /Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride/",

In vitro dissolution studies indicated that the coating levels types of resins and types of plasticizers in the film played a major role in determining drug release rate profiles. Drug release appeared to follow first order kinetics. A coating of 2% Eudragit S-100 eliminated the formation of soft lumps which are commonly seen with Eudragit RS coated beadlets. Eudragit S-100 coating also contributed to retarding drug release in dissolution media at pH 1.2-6.5. It was concluded that pseudoephedrine release from coated beadlets depended on coating levels types of resins and types of plasticizers used. /Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride/",

They are all chiral drugs that exist as stereoisomers. It is possible that each enantiomer can reflect significant enantioselective differences with regard to both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects. Both PPA and PDE are readily and completely absorbed, whereas PE, with a bioavailability of only approximately 38%, is subject to gut wall metabolism and is thought to be absorbed erratically. Peak concn are reached between 0.5 and 2 hr after admin. All three drugs are extensively distributed into extravascular sites (apparent volume of distribution between 2.6 and 5.0 L/kg). No protein binding data in humans are available. Whereas PPA and PDE are not substantially metabolized, PE undergoes extensive biotransformation in the gut wall and the liver. Elimination of PPA and PDE is predominantly renal, with urinary excretion being pH dependent. Half-lives are relatively short, approximately 2.5 hr for PE, 4 hr for PPA, and 6 hr for PDE. Elimination of PPA and PDE may be rapid in children, and the agents should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. In addition, PPA incr caffeine plasma levels and decr theophylline clearance. Reduced metabolism of PE occurs with concurrent admin of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. No direct relationship between nasal decongestant effect and plasma concentration has been established.",

Excretion studies of the ephedrine-related drugs have been performed to better understand the metabolic yields of ephedrines in urine. After consuming a single clinical dose of each of these drugs, urine samples from volunteers (n=3 for each drug) were subjected to tert-butyl-methyl-ether (TBME) extraction and trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA) derivatization before gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Most ephedrines were excreted unchanged in urine, including EPH (40.9%), PEPH (72.2%), and PPA (59.3%). However, only a relatively small amount of MEPH (15.5%) was excreted unchanged in urine. In addition, a trace amount of PPA (1.6%) and cathine (0.7%) was found to be the metabolites of EPH and PEPH, respectively. Urinary EPH, PEPH, and PPA reached peaks at 2-6 hr and disappeared in urine at approximately 24-48 hr post-administration. ...",

Before dosing and at intervals up to 7 hours after dosing, serum pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine concentrations were measured, and pulse and blood pressure were recorded.

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Following intraperitoneal injection of Sprague Dawley rats with pseudoephedrine, Fos induction was measured in various brain areas by Western blots and immunocytochemistry. Pseudoephedrine induced Fos-like immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens and striatum in a time and concentration-dependent manner with maximal effect at 60 mg/kg 2 hr after injection. Immunocytochemical studies confirmed that the majority of the signal was detectable in the nucleus accumbens and striatum. Pre-injection with the D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 partially and completely blocked pseudoephedrine-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity in the striatum and nucleus accumbens, respectively, suggesting that the action of pseudoephedrine is mediated via dopamine release and results in the activation of D1 dopamine receptors. With the exception of the higher doses required, the actions of pseudoephedrine were similar to those previously described for the psychostimulant amphetamine.",

In this process, specialized strains of yeast (typically a variety of Candida utilis or Saccharomyces cerevisiae) are added to large vats containing water, dextrose and the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase (such as found in beets and other plants, inter alia). After the yeast has begun fermenting the dextrose, the benzaldehyde is added to the vats, and in this environment the yeast convert the precursor ingredients to L-phenylacetylcarbinol. /L-phenylacetylcarbinol/ is then chemically converted to pseudoephedrine via reductive amination.",

Pseudoephedrine is sold under many different brand names, including Biofed\u00ae, Cenafed\u00ae, Sudafed\u00ae and Nexafed\u00ae.Sometimes when people find out they are pregnant, they think about changing how they take their medication, or stopping their medication altogether.

Your healthcare providers can talk with you about the benefits of treating your condition and the risks of untreated illness during pregnancy.",

Treat hypertension if the diastolic pressure is higher than 100-105 mm Hg, especially in a patient with no prior history of hypertension. If there is CT or obvious clinical evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, lower the diastolic pressure cautiously to no lower than 90 mm Hg and consult a neurosurgeon immediately. Use a vasodilator such as phentolamine or nitroprusside. Caution: Do not use beta blockers to treat hypertension without first giving a vasodilator; otherwise, paradoxic worsening of the hypertension may result. Many patients have moderate orthostatic variation in blood pressure; therefore, for immediate partial relief of severe hypertensin, try placing the patient in an upright position. Arrhythmias. Tachyarrhythmias usually respond to low-dose esmolol for metoprolol. Caution: Do not treaT AV block or sinus bradycardia associated with hypertension; increasing the heart rate with atropine may abolish this reflex response that serves to limit hypertension, resulting in worsening elevation of the blood pressure. /Pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine, and other decongestants/",

Two analyses of health maintenance organization pharmacy data identified 9 malformed infants among 902 first-trimester pseudoephedrine exposures, suggesting no association with birth defects overall; however, studies of such data sets often lack sufficient power to identify risks for specific birth defects. The related compounds, epinephrine, ephedrine, and phenylephrine, have been associated with hemorrhages and cardiovascular and limb malformations in animal models. Risk of ventricular septal defects was associated with decongestant use in pregnant women in 1 recent study. The vasoconstrictive effects of these drugs raise the hypothesis that their use in early pregnancy might increase the risk of vascular disruption defects. Case-control studies, which often do have power to identify risks related to specific birth defects, have explored this hypothesis. Decongestant use in the first trimester has been associated with small increases in risks of 3 defects thought to arise, at least in some instances, from vascular disruption-gastroschisis, small intestinal atresia, and hemifacial microsomia. These findings are somewhat consistent in terms of magnitude of effect and suggest that risks are even greater among women also exposed to the vasoconstrictive effects of cigarette smoking. There are, however, limitations to these studies, including the possibilities of inaccurate recall of exposures and confounding by indication. In addition, the majority of decongestant use is in oral form and the question of whether intranasal formulations carry risk has not been adequately addressed.",

A follow-up cerebral angiogram demonstrated a small arteriovenous malformation arising off a branch of the pericallosal artery and a small arteriovenous fistula arising off the costal marginal branch. The arteriovenous malformation was embolized without incident, however, the arteriovenous fistula was not accessible. ...

Based on Teratogenic Index [LC50/EC50 (malformation)] values, types and severity of induced malformations, and embryo growth, 5-azacytidine and methotrexate tested as having strong teratogenic potential. Pseudoephedrine scored as having moderate teratogenic potential, but amaranth and aspartame had little or no teratogenic potential.

Changes of dopamine function can induce malfunction of glutamatergic system because there are well-documented interactions between glutamate/N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and dopaminergic system. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute and chronic pseudoephedrine administration on NMDA receptors in hippocampal formation. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the alteration of NMDA receptor density in rat hippocampus and dentate gyrus following acute and chronic pseudoephedrine administration. The density of NMDA receptors was increased significantly (p<0.005) in the dentate gyrus of animals treated with pseudoephedrine chronically when compared with the acute and control groups. Similarly, the density of NMDA receptors in an acute group was also higher than the control group (p<0.01). These results indicate that pseudoephedrine could induce an increase of NMDA receptors in the dentate gyrus. This might be a compensatory effect of NMDA receptor in response to the degeneration or loss of glutamatergic neurons.",

It is found in plants of the genus Ephedra (Ephedraceae) known in traditional medicine as Ma Huang. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 8.3X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates pseudoephedrine will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase pseudoephedrine will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 4 hours. Particulate-phase pseudoephedrine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition Pseudoephedrine does not contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, pseudoephedrine is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 73. However, the pKa of pseudoephedrine is 10.25, indicating that this compound will primarily exist in the cation form in the environment and cations generally adsorb more strongly to soils containing organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Biodegradation data are not available. If released into water, pseudoephedrine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. A pKa of 10.25 indicates pseudoephedrine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to pseudoephedrine may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where pseudoephedrine is produced or used. Exposure to pseudoephedrine among the general population may be limited to those administered various decongestants. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Triprolidine concentrations in milk and plasma were more variable between subjects than those of pseudoephedrine. AUC values for milk and plasma were similar for one subject, while the plasma value exceeded that for milk in another woman.

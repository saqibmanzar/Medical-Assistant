Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

If released to the atmosphere, bromotrichloromethane is expected to exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere based on a measured vapor pressure of 39 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase bromotrichloromethane is expected to degrade slowly in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals based on its structural similarity to bromotrifluoromethane; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be greater than 44 years. Photolysis may occur based on bromotrichloromethane's structural similarity to other halogenated methane compounds but not at an environmentally important rate. If released to soil, bromotrichloromethane is expected to have low mobility based on an estimated Koc of 567. The potential for volatilization of bromotrichloromethane from dry soil surfaces may exist based on this compound's vapor pressure. Bromotrichloromethane may volatilize from moist soil surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based on the estimated Henry's Law constant for this compound. Estimated volatilization half-lives from a model river and model lake are 7.4 hours and 6.6 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 49 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Based upon the highly halogenated structure of bromotrichloromethane, biodegradation in the environment is expected to be slow. Occupational exposure to bromotrichloromethane may occur through inhalation or dermal contact with this compound in workplaces where it is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to bromotrichloromethane via ingestion of food and drinking water. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 3.7 hrs and 6.6 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 49(SRC), from an estimated log Kow(2) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Based upon the highly halogenated structure of bromotrichloromethane, biodegradation in water is expected to be slow(7).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

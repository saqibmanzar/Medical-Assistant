When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Clinically apparent liver injury from mepacrine has also been reported, but the clinical features of the injury have not been well defined. Because mepacrine causes a yellowing of the skin, jaundice is not a reliable finding and most reports of liver injury from mepacrine have not included bilirubin elevations. Nevertheless, several instances of acute liver failure and death have been attributed to mepacrine therapy, although the reports usually predated the availability of tests for hepatitis A, B and C and often lacked histological documentation. Mepacrine has also been implicated in cases of aplastic anemia and in hypersensitivity reactions with exfoliative dermatitis, suggestive of Stevens Johnson syndrome, conditions that can be associated with liver injury that may be severe.",

In one of these cases, a child having malaria, possibly pulmonary tuberculosis, and iridocyclitis in one eye, developed transient optic neuritis in the other eye after receiving several doses of quinacrine plus pamaquine. In the second case the patient was taking quinine as well as quinacrine for malaria. This patient had xanthopsia for 10 days before gradually becoming blind. Papilledema was the only abnormality observed in the fundus. In the course of a month after quinacrine was discontinued, vision recovered completely, although quinine was still being given.",

Female inbred F344 rats were divided into three experimental groups. Animals were injected ip with either CQ, QN or normal saline for 5 days/week throughout the entire experimental period (25 days). After 7 days of drug treatment each rat received sc one 2 mm aliquot of R3230AC mammary adenocarcinoma in the mid-thoracic region. Eighteen days after implantation, all rats were sacrificed and tumors were excised, weighed and measured. The results indicate that weights and volumes of tumors as well as tumor to body weight ratios were significantly higher in CQ and QN treated animals than those in saline treated animals. The final body weights of rats treated with QN were significantly lower than those treated with saline. The prostaglandin E2 content of tumors was significantly reduced by CQ treatment. Erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient and reduced glutathione concentrations remained unaffected by both treatments. These results suggest that CQ and QN have significant stimulatory effects on the growth of mammary adenocarcinoma in rats.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.8X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates quinacrine will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase quinacrine will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Quinacrine absorbs light at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, quinacrine is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 4.9X10+6. Estimated pKa values of 9.4 and 10.7 (amine groups) indicate quinacrine will exist almost entirely in the cation form at pH values of 5 to 9 and therefore volatilization from moist soil and water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process. Cations generally adsorb more strongly to organic carbon and clay than their neutral counterparts. Quinacrine will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, quinacrine is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. An estimated BCF of 5,400 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to quinacrine may occur through dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where quinacrine is produced or used. Exposure to quinacrine among the general population may be limited to those administered the drug as an antimalarial. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

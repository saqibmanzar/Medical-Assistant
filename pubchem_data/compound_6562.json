ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The detoxification of aldehydes can be seen to proceed basically via two routes: (1) an oxidation to yield readily metabolized acids; (2) inactivation by reaction with sulfhydryl groups, particularly glutathione. Under conditions that either deplete glutathione levels, or that result in an inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase (for example, Antabuse treatment), the acute and chronic effects of aldehyde toxicity might be more fully expressed. /Aldehydes/",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Aldehydes can react with air to give first peroxo acids, and ultimately carboxylic acids.

It has been detected in the emissions from automobile exhaust, liquid floor wax, steel protective paints, and from trees. It also has been identified in urban and rural air samples, Chickpea seed, and in human adipose tissue. If released to soil, methacrolein will have very high mobility. Volatilization of methacrolein will be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of methacrolein in soil or water. If released to water, methacrolein may not adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Methacrolein may volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of about 5 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 1.4 suggests that methacrolein will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. If released to the atmosphere, methacrolein will exist in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase methacrolein is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 11.5 hours. Vapor-phase methacrolein is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone with an estimated half-life of about 10.5 days. Methacrolein reacts very quickly in air with oxygen forming peroxides and acids. Methacrolein is formed from the gas-phase reaction of ozone with isoprene. Exposure to methacrolein may occur through dermal contact and inhalation. (SRC)",

Methacrolein may volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.86X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values of vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(2). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 4 days, respectively(3,SRC). An estimated BCF value of 1.4(3,SRC), from an experimental water solubility(2), suggests that methacrolein will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a recommended classification scheme(5). Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of methacrolein in water(SRC).",

Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This value indicates that methacrolein will volatilize from water surfaces(3,SRC). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 5 hours(3,SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec) is estimated as approximately 4 days(3,SRC). Methacrolein's high vapor pressure(1) and Henry's Law constant(1,2,SRC) indicate that volatilization from dry and moist soil may occur(SRC).",

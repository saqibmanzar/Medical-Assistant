PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

However, in a diffusion experiment only 0.3% (rat skin) or 0.2% (human skin) of diphenyl ether penetrated the skin in vitro. The higher absorption in the in vivo experiment may have been caused by the vehicle (diethyl phthalate) and some oral uptake after removal of the occlusion plaster.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

Employed as a processing aid in the production of polyesters. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Contact with a commercial product containing diphenyl ether has caused burning of the eyes, irritation of the respiratory tract, and severe nausea along with skin irritation. Oral exposure to a commercial product containing this chemical has caused severe degenerative changes in the liver and kidney. Prolonged exposure of skin to liquid causes reddening and irritation. Occupational exposure to diphenyl ether occurs through dermal contact and inhalation of vapor. Its use in various soap, detergent, creams, lotion, and perfume formulations results in general population exposure through inhalation and dermal contact. Diphenyl ether was detected in collected composite adipose tissue. ANIMAL STUDIES: In acute oral exposures of diphenyl ether to rats, injury to the liver, spleen, kidney, thyroid and intestinal tract was observed. Undiluted diphenyl ether is irritating to rabbit skin. Erythema and exfoliation of skin was noted.",

DPE was diluted in diethyl phthalate (DEP) to administer a total application volume of 2 mL/kg and concentrations of 0.5, 5 and 50% (approximately equal to 10, 100 and 1000 mg DPE/kg body weight). Approximately 17.7% of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine, with small amounts also found in the feces (1.18-3.79%). At 72 hr post-dosing, approximately 0.2% of the applied dose was retained in the body with low levels also measured in the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract (approximately equal to 0.04, 0.02 and 0.3%, respectively).",

Approximately 67% is used in making heat-transfer fluids; approximately 100,000 lbs is used annually in fragrance products. Diphenyl ether reportedly occurs in lemon balm oil. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2.25X10-2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates diphenyl ether will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase diphenyl ether will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 days. Diphenyl ether contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, diphenyl ether is expected to have low mobility based upon a Koc of 1950. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.8X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Diphenyl ether is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 6.3% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, diphenyl ether is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces may be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 hours and 6 days, respectively. Experimental BCF values of 195, 470 and 590, suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate to high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to diphenyl ether may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where diphenyl ether is produced or used. The most likely pathway by which the general public is exposed to diphenyl ether is by inhalation and dermal contact due to it's use as a fragrance in soaps, detergents, creams, lotions, and perfumes.

Vapor-phase diphenyl ether is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.8X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Diphenyl ether contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

By TLC, HPLC, GC, GC-MS, NMR- and UV-spectroscopy, several oxidation products were identified. The primary attack was initiated by a monooxygenation step, resulting in the formation of 4-hydroxydiphenyl ether, 2-hydroxydiphenyl ether and 3-hydroxydiphenyl ether (48:47:5). Further oxidation led to 3,4-dihydroxydiphenyl ether. As a characteristic product resulting from the cleavage of an aromatic ring, the lactone of 2-hydroxy-4-phenoxymuconic acid was identified. The possible mechanism of ring cleavage to yield this metabolite is discussed(1).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The compound has been detected in wastewater effluents from municipal waste water treatment facilities(2,3), textile finishing plants(4), organic chemical and plastic manufacturing plants, soap and detergent facilities, and electronic facilities(5). Diphenyl ether is reportedly released to the atmosphere in emissions from combustion, phthalic anhydride manufacture, and turbine engines(6). The detection of diphenyl ether in river water samples adjacent to hazardous waste disposal areas in Niagara Falls, NY indicates that leaching is a source of environmental contamination(7). Possible sources of release to environmental waters include spent heat exchange chemicals and byproduct from phenol manufacture(8).",

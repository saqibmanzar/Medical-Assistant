Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

Because of this oxidation by plants and in spite of some inevitable loss of total residue, residues on plants to which phorate had been applied increase in anticholinesterase activity for several days and only then gradually lose activity. Although phorate metabolites could be detected in foliage of 7.4 week old cotton plants grown from treated seed, no metabolites (<0.03 ppm) could be found in the seeds gathered when the plants were 16 weeks old.",

Piperonyl butoxide treatment produced a distinct biphasic effect (initial inhibition and subsequent induction) on several hepatic enzyme activities, including phorate sulfoxidation. The relative contribution by the cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase system to phorate sulfoxidation decreased from 76% in control to 58% at 2 hr after treatment and increased to 89% at 12 hr. Hydrocortisone treatment caused an increase in flavin containing monooxygenase activity in liver microsomes, but not in lung microsomes. Administration of acetone caused an increase in benzphetamine N-demethylation and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation in the liver, but no change in phorate sulfoxidase activity was observed, nor was the relative contributions due to the cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase system and flavin containing monooxygenase altered. Treatment with phenobarbital produced a large increase in both benzephetamine N-demethylase and phorate sulfoxidase activity in liver microsomes, with the percentage of phorate sulfoxidase activity due to the cytochrome p450 dependent monooxygenase system being increased from 76% in the control livers to 85% in the treated livers.",

The glutathione transferase reactions produce products that are, in most cases, of low toxicity. Paraoxonase (PON1) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of organophosphates. PON1 can inactivate some organophosphates through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes the active metabolites in several organophosphates insecticides as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes there to be different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of organophosphate exposure.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether they are eligible for reregistration. In addition, all pesticides must meet the new safety standard of the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Phorate is found on List A, which contains most food use pesticides and consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA, as amended in 1988. Case No: 0103; Pesticide type: Insecticide; Registration Standard Date: 08/01/84; Case Status: OPP is reviewing data from the pesticide's producers regarding its human health and/or environmental effects, or OPP is determining the pesticide's eligibility for reregistration and developing the Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): Phorate; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 10/14/92, 10/13/95; AI Status: The producers of the pesticide have made commitments to conduct the studies and pay the fees required for reregistration, and are meeting those commitments in a timely manner.",

EPA has proposed to revoke tolerances in or on meat, milk, poultry and eggs for residues of phorate because the Agency has determined that there are no reasonable expectations of finite residues and the tolerances are not necessary.

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or 'anticholinesterase') suppresses the action of acetylcholinesterase. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of acetylcholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death.  Nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by binding a serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. Acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop. Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen.",

Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if respiratory muscles are involved.  Accumulation of ACh at motor nerves causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression at the neuromuscular junction. When this occurs symptoms such as muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, fasciculation, and paralysis can be seen. When there is an accumulation of ACh at autonomic ganglia this causes overstimulation of nicotinic expression in the sympathetic system. Symptoms associated with this are hypertension, and hypoglycemia. Overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, due to accumulation of ACh, results in anxiety, headache, convulsions, ataxia, depression of respiration and circulation, tremor, general weakness, and potentially coma. When there is expression of muscarinic overstimulation due to excess acetylcholine at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors symptoms of visual disturbances, tightness in chest, wheezing due to bronchoconstriction, increased bronchial secretions, increased salivation, lacrimation, sweating, peristalsis, and urination can occur.  Certain reproductive effects in fertility, growth, and development for males and females have been linked specifically to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Most of the research on reproductive effects has been conducted on farmers working with pesticides and insecticdes in rural areas. In females menstrual cycle disturbances, longer pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and some developmental effects in offspring have been linked to organophosphate pesticide exposure. Prenatal exposure has been linked to impaired fetal growth and development. Neurotoxic effects have also been linked to poisoning with OP pesticides causing four neurotoxic effects in humans: cholinergic syndrome, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP), and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND). These syndromes result after acute and chronic exposure to OP pesticides.",

For skin contact, the skin should be washed with soap and water. If the compound has entered the eyes, they should be washed with large quantities of isotonic saline or water. In serious cases, atropine and/or pralidoxime should be administered. Anti-cholinergic drugs work to counteract the effects of excess acetylcholine and reactivate AChE. Atropine can be used as an antidote in conjunction with pralidoxime or other pyridinium oximes (such as trimedoxime or obidoxime), though the use of '-oximes' has been found to be of no benefit, or possibly harmful, in at least two meta-analyses. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and thus blocks the action of acetylcholine peripherally.",

Remember that atropine can be administered through an endotracheal tube if initial IV access if difficult to obtain. Depending on the severity of poisoning, doses of atropine ranging from very low to...high... . The objective of atropine antidotal therapy is to antagonize the effects of excessive concentrations of acetylcholine at end-organs having muscarinic receptors. Atropine does not reactivate the cholinesterase enzyme or accelerate disposition of organophosphate. Recrudescence of poisoning may occur if tissue concentrations of organophosphate remain high when the effect of atropine wears off. Atropine is effective against muscarinic manifestations, but it is ineffective against nicotinic actions, specifically muscle weakness and twitching, and respiratory depression. Despite the limitations, atropine is often a life-saving agent in organophosphate poisonings. Favorable response to a test dose of atropine can help differentiate poisoning by anticholinesterase agents from other conditions. However, lack of response, with no evidence of atropinization (atropine refractoriness) is typical of more severe poisonings. The adjunctive use of nebulized atropine has been reported to improve respiratory distress, decrease bronchial secretions, and increase oxygenation. ...Do not administer atropine or pralidoxime prophylactically to workers exposed to organophosphate pesticides. Prophylactic dosage with either atropine or pralidoxime may mask early signs and symptoms of organophosphate poisoning and thus allow the worker to continue exposure and possibly progress to more severe poisoning. Atropine itself may enhance the health hazards of the agricultural work setting: impaired heat loss due to reduced sweating and impaired ability to operate mechanical equipment due to blurred vision. This can be caused by mydriasis, one of the effects of atropine. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

During this study, atropine was used as a bolus for a heart rate less than 60 beats/min. The other apparent advantage to this regimen was a decreased number of respiratory infections. This may represent an alternative when there is a concern for respiratory infection due to excessive and difficult to control secretions, and in the presence of altered level of consciousness where the distinction between atropine toxicity or relapse of organophosphate poisoning is unclear. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

Before administration of pralidoxime, draw a blood sample (heparinized) for cholinesterase analysis (since pralidoxime tends to reverse the cholinesterase depression). Administration pralidoxime (Protopam, 2-PAM), a cholinesterase reactivator, in cases of severe poisoning by organophosphate pesticides in which respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and/or twitching are severe. When administered early (usually less than 48 hours after poisoning) pralidoxime relieves the nicotinic as well as the muscarinic effects of poisoning. Pralidoxime works by reactivating the cholinesterase and also by slowing the \"aging\" process of phosphorylated cholinesterase to a non-reactivatable form. ... Dosage of pralidoxime may be repeated in 1-2 hours, then at 10-12 hour intervals if needed. In very severe poisonings, dosage rates may be doubled. Repeated doses of pralidoxime are usually required. In cases that involve continuing absorption of organophosphate (as after ingestion of large amounts), or continuing transfer of highly lipophilic organophosphate from fat into blood, it may be necessary to continue administration of pralidoxime for several days beyond the 48 hour post-exposure interval usually cited as the limit of its effectiveness. ... Blood pressure should be monitored during administration because of the occasional occurrence of hypertensive crisis. Administration should be slowed or stopped if blood pressure rises to hazardous levels. Be prepared to assist pulmonary ventilation mechanically if respiration is depressed during or after pralidoxime administration. If intravenous injection is not possible, pralidoxime may be given by deep intramuscular injection. /Organophosphate pesticides/",

If the average of several pre-exposure values were available, then a decrease of 17% would be significant. It has been recommended that, if measured activity is reduced by 30% or more of the pre-exposure value, AChE measurements should be repeated at appropriate intervals to confirm the results. Depressions of AChE or ChE in excess of 20-25% are considered diagnostic of exposure but not, necessarily, indicative of hazard. Depressions of 30-50% or more are considered indicators for removal of an exposed individual from further contact with pesticides until levels return to normal. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/"

Advances in gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) have made it possible to analyse the urine of exposed persons for the presence of appropriate metabolites. It is usually necessary to preserve the sample by the addition of chloroform, to concentrate or extract the metabolite(s), and to convert them to suitably-volatile derivatives that can be detected by GC. Obviously, access to a well-equipped analytical laboratory, capable of the quick processing of samples, is a necessary factor if monitoring by urine analysis is proposed. However, in some cases, simpler and sensitive colorimetric tests are available for screening the urine of exposed persons. Thus, 4-nitrophenol can be measured directly in the urine of workers exposed to parathion. Consideration of the concentration of metabolite(s) in the urine can be helpful in determining patterns of exposure, and these concentrations can be calibrated against the effects on AChE for a particular pesticide. However, the time-course and peak of excretion of metabolites appears to vary according to dose, so that serial sampling and analyses of urine are desirable. Levels of metabolite alone cannot be considered a guide to hazard. This is obvious when it is realized that pesticides that have very different toxicities may yield identical acidic metabolites. Thus, the level of metabolites in urine, after exposure to sufficient amounts of the very toxic parathion-methyl to depress blood-AChE to 50%, will be much lower than that of the identical metabolites, following exposure to the related fenitrothion, which is about 40 times less toxic. /Organophosphorus Pesticides/",

No significant difference between the groups was found on audiometric tests, ophthalmic tests, electroencephalograms, or the clinical serum and blood chemistry evaluations. From the neurological examination, abnormalities were demonstrated among the cases only on measures of memory, abstraction, and mood, and on one test of motor reflexes. Differences between the cohorts were more apparent in the neuropsychological tests, and occurred on tests of widely varying abilities, including intellectual functioning, academic skills, abstraction and flexibility of thinking and simple motor skills. ...The results indicate that there are subtle chronic neurological sequalae to acute organophosphate poisoning. /Organophosphates/",

The animals were exposed to this dose in a whole-body inhalation chamber for 12 weeks and the biochemical and histopathological changes were studied in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th weeks of exposure. A significant rise in creatinine level was observed from the 4th week of exposure until the end of the experiment. This rise suggests impairment of the glomerular function and tubular damage in the kidneys. These changes were confirmed by histopathological studies in the tubules. Kidney lesions were present throughout the experimental period. These consisted of mild to severe multifocal cloudy and hydropic degeneration with necrosis in the tubules, though the glomerular damage was not seen by light microscopy. After a 30-day recovery period, the histopathological and biochemical changes were absent and normal patterns were restored.",

The higher concentration of pesticides resultant into zero percent of  fecundity and viability while in lower concentration the number of egg masses as well as number of egg capsules/egg mass showed significant decrease in comparison to the control groups.

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.000638 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates phroate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase phorate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 hours. Laboratory experiments indicated rapid gas-phase photolysis of phorate under midsummer sunlight conditions with observed half-lives <30 minutes. If released to soil, phorate is expected to have low to slight mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 543-3200. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.37X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Biodegradation studies suggest phorate will biodegrade in soils (half-lives ranging from 5 to 68 days) and in the water column (half-lives ranging from 1 to 1.5 days). If released into water, phorate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc values. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 14 and 105 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A BCF of 90 for juvenile sheepshead minnows suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Half-lives for the hydrolysis of phorate at pH 5.7, 8.5, 9.4, and 10.25, were 52, 61, 62, and 33 days, respectively, producing diethyl disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and formaldehyde uner alkaline conditions. Occupational exposure to phorate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where phorate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to phorate via inhalation of ambient air, and ingestion of food. (SRC",

Volatilization of phorate from moist soil surfaces is expected(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 4.37X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.000638 mm Hg(3) and water solubility, 50 mg/l(3). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Phorate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC), based upon its vapor pressure(3). The rate of photolysis for phorate in soil was reported as 0.3758 per day at 25 \u00b0C(5), which corresponds to a half-life of 1.8 days(SRC). Biodegradation studies suggest phorate will biodegrade in soils with half-lives ranging from 5 to 68 days(6,7).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(5) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 4.37X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 0.000638 mm Hg(3) and water solubility, 50 mg/l(3). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(5), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 14 and 105 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 810 days if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), a BCF of 90(8), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate(SRC). Half-lives for the hydrolysis of phorate at pH 5.7, 8.5, 9.4, and 10.25 were 52, 61, 62, and 33 days, respectively, producing diethyl disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and formaldehyde uner alkaline conditions(9). No significant catalytic effect was observed in the presences of several metal oxides(9). Aqueous solutions of phorate are degraded by light with a half-life of 1.1 days(3). Half-lives of 1.2 days and 1.1 days were determined for phorate in active sediment and water, respectively(9). In shake flasks tests, phorate showed more degradation in the presence of non-sterile estuarine sediment, half-life of about 1 day, than in the presence of sterile sediment, half-life of about 1.5 days(10). The half-lives of phorate in shake flasks containing a non-sterile sediment-water slurry were less than 1 day(10). The half-lives (days) of phorate in water of the Limon River, Venezula that had been filtered through cellulose acetate with 0.45 um porosity were 12.63 (dark) and 11.87 (sunlight); half-lives (days) in non-filtered water exposed to sunlight were 12.46 (open) and 11.46 (closed)(11).",

Vapor-phase phorate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.5 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.5X10-10 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Laboratory experiments indicated rapid gas-phase photolysis of phorate under midsummer sunlight conditions with observed half-lives <30 minutes(4).",

One-half of the applied phorate dosage to silt loam soil could no longer be detected after 6 days when applied to the soil surface and after 30 days when mixed with the upper 4-5 inch soil layer(2). In silt loam soil, phorate persisted beyond 16 weeks at 25 \u00b0C(3). The half-life of phorate in clay loam soil when applied as a granular formulation ranged from 5 to 10 days(4). In a field study, 67 and 70% of phorate was lost within 28 days from silty clay loam soil(5). Bioassays indicate the half-life of phorate, when applied to the top 4 inches of sandy loam soil at a concentration of 10 ppm, is about 68 days(6). In flooded agricultural loam soil, 1.7, 6.0, and 9.9% of the applied C14-phorate had been evolved as C14-CO2 after 3, 7, and 14 days incubation, respectively(7). In non-flooded soils, 1.3, 2.3, and 3.3% of the applied C14-phorate had been evolved as C14-CO2 after identical incubation periods(7). Half-lives of 1.2 days and 1.1 days were determined for phorate in active sediment and water, respectively(8). In a 1 week laboratory assay, phorate mineralization was not significantly greater in soils with a history of phorate use than in soils with no history of phorate use(9). The microbial degradation of phorate in loam soil, sandy soil, and muck soil led to the formation of phorate sulfone and phorate sulfoxide; formation was much less in sandy soil(10). Phorate, when applied at a rate of 1.25 kg AI/ha to black clay loam soils under flooded conditions, degraded quickly(11). In shake flask tests, phorate showed more degradation in the presence of non-sterile estuarine sediment, half-life of about 1 day, than in the presence of sterile sediment, half-life of about 1.5 days(12). The half-lives of phorate in shake flasks containing a non-sterile sediment-water slurry were less than 1 day(12). In studies where 32 farm soils were incubated with phorate, initial half-lives of freshly-applied phorate ranged from <1 to >16 weeks(13). Accelerated degradation was stimulated by a single application and occurred most readily at pH's >7.4(13).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.5 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). The observed half-life of phorate in 1% ethanol (in sterile water), phosphate buffered solutions, at 25 \u00b0C is 0.60 weeks at pH 5.0, 0.55 weeks at pH 6, 0.57 weeks at pH 7, and 0.68 weeks at pH 8(2). Half-lives for the hydrolysis of phorate at pH 5.7, 8.5, 9.4, and 10.25 were 52, 61, 62, and 33 days(3). Hydrolysis of phorate under alkaline coniditions produces diethyl disulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and formaldehyde; no significant catalytic effect was observed in the presences of several metal oxides(3). In a field trial, the half-life for phorate on apple tree leaves was 0.2 days(4). The half-life of phorate on plant foliage ranged from 1.4 to 3.6 days(5). Aqueous solutions of phorate are degraded by light with a half-life of 1.1 d(6). Calculated half-lives for phorate on alfalfa and coastal bermuda grass were 3.6 and 1.4 days, respectively(7). Laboratory experiments indicated rapid gas-phase photolysis of phorate under midsummer sunlight conditions with observed half-lives <30 minutes(9).",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

Bioconcentration of phorate from culture media by the blue green algae Anabaena sp. (ARM 310) and Aulosira fertilissima (ARM 68) was studied(1). Bioconcentration factors for phorate in Anabaena sp. were 3, 6 and 12 at 2.5, 5 and 10 ug/ml, respectively(3). In Anabaena fertilissima, at 2.5, 5 and 10 ug/ml of phorate, max bioconcentration of phorate was reached after 16, 16 and 32 hr, respectively, with bioconcentration factors of 8, 12 and 11 for the respective doses(3). Elodea nuttallii plants grown for 2 weeks in water with a deposit of C14-phorate in the bottom soil accumulated 30% of the originally soil-applied radiocarbon in their tissues; 56% of phorate accumulated in plant tissues when the insecticide was applied directly to the water(4).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Phorate was less mobile in degraded chernozem and in black marsh soil, than in brown forest soil(4). According to a classification scheme(5), these Koc values suggest that phorate is expected to have low to slight mobility in soil. Phorate is most readily adsorbed to mineral solids and to silty loam and clay soils when the soils are dry(4). A soil mobility factor of 1.2 was calculated for phorate using soil column studies with Hagerstown silty clay loam (4.3% organic matter, 30% clay, pH 5.5) and Lakeland sandy loam(3.3% organic matter, 10% clay, pH 6.2)(6). A mobility factor of 1 represents no movement, while a mobility factor of 6 represents maximum movement(7). In a field study using watershed soils and their corresponding pond sediments, phorate was adsorbed more extensively by pond sediments (organic matter 1.4%, clay content 25%) than by Ca-saturated soils (organic matter 2.4%, clay content 16%)(7).",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that phorate is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 14 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 105 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column(SRC). The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is 810 days if adsorption is considered(3). The presence of sediment in the water column has been shown to inhibit volatilization of phorate(4).

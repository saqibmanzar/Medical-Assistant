PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

                        "Description": "In medicine, the term \"mechanism of action\" (also called MOA) is used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Isobornyl acetate was administered daily to rats in doses of 0, 15, 90 or 270 mg/kg bw for 13 wk. Male rats had signs of nephrotoxicity at 90 mg/kg and 270 mg/kg/day, as well as signs of hepatotoxicity at 270 mg/kg. Isobornyl acetate was investigated in a 1-generation reproduction study in rats and it did not produce developmental toxicity. Increased incidences of excess salivation occurred in parent generation male and female rats at 100 and/or 300 mg/kg/d throughout the dosage period, and low incidences of urine-stained abdominal fur were seen in females at 300 mg/kg/d during the gestation period.",

After weaning, 25 F1 generation pups/sex/dosage group were randomly selected for evaluation until sexual maturity. The following parameters were evaluated in P generation males and females: viability, clinical signs, body weights, feed consumption, mating and fertility, organ weights, gross and microscopic observations, sperm assessments (motility and concentration), natural delivery and litter observations, and ovarian follicle counts. In F1 generation pups, viability, body weights, sexual maturation, anogenital distance (days 1 and 22 postpartum), nipple eruption (day 12 postpartum), and gross necropsy observations were recorded. Isobornyl acetate did not adversely affect any of the investigated parameters. Based on the results of this investigation, the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) for toxicity of IA is considered to be 300 mg/kg/d. Increased incidences of excess salivation occurred in P generation male and female rats at 100 and/or 300 mg/kg/d throughout the dosage period, and low incidences of urine-stained abdominal fur were seen in females at 300 mg/kg/d during the gestation period. These clinical signs were not considered as adverse effects of IA administration. Thus, the NOAEL for reproductive toxicity in the P generation rats and the NOAEL for viability and growth of the F1 generation offspring is considered to be =300 mg/kg/d.",

Its use in compounding needle odors and theater sprays will result in its direct release to the environment. Isobornyl acetate is reported in a wide variety of herbs and other plants. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.11 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates isobornyl acetate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase isobornyl acetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 50 hrs. Isobornyl acetate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, isobornyl acetate is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 420. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Isobornyl acetate has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.11 mm Hg and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions; therefore, isobornyl acetate may volatilize from dry soil. Using the OECD Biodegradability test, isoborneol acetate was biodegraded in 10 days, suggesting that biodegradation is an important environment fate process in soil or water. If released into water, isobornyl acetate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 17 hrs and 9.5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 320 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is moderate. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process as indicated by estimated base-catalyzed second-order half-lives of 2.3 yrs and 84 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to isobornyl acetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where isobornyl acetate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to isobornyl acetate via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with consumer products containing isobornyl acetate.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 17 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9.5 days(SRC). Isobornyl acetate's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC).Isobornyl acetate has an estimated vapor pressure of 0.11 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(13) and exists as a liquid under environmental conditions: therefore, isobornyl acetate may volatilize from dry soil(SRC). Isobornyl acetate dissipated within one week when added along with 21 other fragrance materials to a Georgetown, DE anaerobically digested municipal sludge and applied to four soils (sandy agricultural loam, silty midwestern agrigultural loam, high organic carbon soil, and a highly weathered oxide-rich soil)(3).",

The chemical compositions of these essential oils were analyzed by the GC and GC/MS systems. Qualitative and quantitative differences were recorded between essential oils extracted from plants collected from the three geographical provinces and between organs of the same plant (leaves and flowers). ... 161 components representing 87.2 - 96.5% of the whole oils were identified. Myrcene (3.2 - 35.7%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (0.6 - 23.0%), camphor (0.6 - 17.2%), cis-chrysanthenol (0 - 6.9%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (1.1 - 17.9%), isobornyl acetate (1.6 - 3.5%), (E)-beta-farnesene (0 - 6.0%), germacrene D (0 - 8.7%), and (E,E)-a-farnesene (0.7 - 12.4%) were the predominant components in the oils. These major constituents occur in different amounts depending on the organs (leaves or flowers) and the geographical origin of the plant. The chemotaxonomic usefulness of these data was discussed according to results of principal component analysis (PCA). ...",

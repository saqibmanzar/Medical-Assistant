PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.

Terphenyl, unspecified isomers, also occurs naturally in petroleum oil. If released to the atmosphere, o-terphenyl will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere based on a vapor pressure of 2.5X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C, determined from experimentally-derived coefficients. Vapor-phase o-terphenyl is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2 days. Particulate-phase o-terphenyl may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 3900 suggests that o-terphenyl will have slight mobility in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 6.1X10-5 atm cu m/mol, but not be significant from dry soil surfaces given o-terphenyl's vapor pressure. Based on limited data, o-terphenyl may be resistant to aerobic biodegradation in soil and water. o-Terphenyl may adsorb to suspended matter in the water based on its Koc value. This compound is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given its estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 26 hours and 13 days, respectively. An experimental BCF value of 590, measured in goldfish, suggests that o-terphenyl will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. Occupational exposure may occur through dermal contact at workplaces where terephenyl's are produced or used. (SRC)",

Vapor-phase o-terphenyl is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 2 days(3,SRC). Particulate-phase o-terphenyl may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

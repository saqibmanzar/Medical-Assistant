When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Recoveries of each compound were assessed in two different pharmaceutical matrices (intermediate and final active pharmaceutical ingredient) and ranged from 75 to 125%. The limit of quantitation has been determined to be 0.10% wt/wt for CAA and 0.03% wt/wt for CAC and MCA. The linearity ranged from 0.03 to 5.00% wt/wt for CAC and MCA and from 0.10 to 5.00% wt/wt for CAA, with correlation coefficients from 0.9995 to 1.0000.

A systematic screening of various anionic probes was performed to obtain the best separation conditions and sensitivity. High sensitivities with low quantification and detection levels were achieved for dimethylsulfate and chloroacetyl chloride using a background electrolyte (BGE) containing 5 mM pyridine dicarboxylic acid as the probe ion. The method is specific, precise and accurate for the two genotoxins. The optimized method was validated for specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy and stability in solution. Calibration curves were linear (R>0.999) for both dimethylsulfate and chloroacetyl chloride in the range LOQ - 300% of nominal concentrations. The CE method was effectively implemented for estimating dimethylsulfate and chloroacetyl chloride in two different active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

It is also used as a tear gas. HUMAN STUDIES: The effects of acute exposure include: skin erythema and burns, respiratory effects including dyspnea, cyanosis, and cough, and gastrointestinal effects. Painful eye irritation and lacrimation around 1 ppm. Chloroacetyl chloride may promote ventricular arrhythmias. ANIMAL STUDIES: A subchronic inhalation study was conducted in which rats, mice, and hamsters were exposed at averaged vapor concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 5 ppm chloroacetyl chloride 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Most of the rats inhaling the 5 ppm or 2.5 ppm concentrations died during the first 2 weeks of exposure. Mortality in mice at these two higher concentrations was 15% and 10%, respectively. All animals survived in the other exposure groups, including hamsters at all concentrations. Respiratory and/or eye irritation was observed in all three species at all exposure levels. Chloroacetyl chloride was not mutagenic in five strains of Salmonella, with or without metabolic activation. It did not induce sister chromatid exchange or chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster cells when tested both with and without metabolic activation.",

At the time of the published account, 2 years after the accident, the patient was still comatose. The relative contribution of the three chemicals to the patient's condition is unknown. However, the authors related information obtained from the chloroacetyl chloride manufacturer that two fatalities had resulted from exposure to chloroacetyl chloride, one of them following massive skin contact followed by cardiorespiratory arrest within a few minutes. According to that manufacturer, other data indicated that chloroacetyl chloride may promote ventricular arrhythmias.",

These average, analytically determined concentrations were substantially lower than nominal concentrations. Most of the rats inhaling the 5 ppm or 2.5 ppm concentrations died during the first 2 weeks of exposure. Mortality in mice at these two higher concentrations was 15% and 10%, respectively. All animals survived in the other exposure groups, including hamsters at all concentrations. Respiratory and/or eye irritation was observed in all three species at all exposure levels. The severity and incidence of irritation were concentration-dependent, with only slight effects evident at the 0.5 ppm concentration. Dose related decreases in body weight gains occurred in rats and mice exposed at 1 ppm and above. Body weight was decreased in female hamsters exposed at 5 ppm or 2.5 ppm and in males at the highest level only. Respiratory tract lesions were grossly visible in rats and mice exposed at 5 ppm or 2.5 ppm and were microscopically evident at all exposure concentrations. The severity of the histopathologic changes and the extent of the respiratory system affected were related to exposure concentrations. Although the entire respiratory tract was affected at the higher concentrations, the most severe response was observed in the nasal region. Respiratory epithelium of the nasal mucosa showed inflammation, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and occasionally, squamous metaplasia. These effects ranged from very slight to moderate in rats and mice exposed at 0.5 ppm. There were no gross histopathological lesions in other organs and tissues studied. Hamsters showed no gross pathologic respiratory effects and were not examined histopathologically.",

Application sites were covered with semi-occluded dressings while animals were restrained in stocks to prevent anything but a dermal exposure, the dressing and test substance removed after 24 hours. Treatment was associated with signs of systemic toxicity including reduced appetite of 3-5 days' duration in study survivors, progressive weakness, dyspnea, collapse, and death consistent with a minimal lethal dose between 316 and 501 mg/kg, and with time to death (3 hours - 2 days) inversely correlated to dose. Upon necropsy of study lethalities, visceral abnormalities included slightly enlarged gall bladder and hemorrhagic lungs and liver. The study survivors exhibited no treatment-related gross pathology upon Day 14 post-treatment sacrifice, other than the severe deep dermal injury which was common in all treated rabbits.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 25.2 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates chloroacetyl chloride will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase chloroacetyl chloride will be degraded slowly in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 670 days. Chloroacetyl chloride contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, chloroacetyl chloride is expected to react rapidly with soil moisture and decompose to chloroacetic acid and hydrochloric acid. Volatilization, adsorption, and biodegradation are not expected to be important fate processes in moist soils due to rapid reaction of chloroacetyl chloride with moisture. Chloroacetyl chloride may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, adsorption to suspended solids and sediment, biodegradation, volatilization and bioconcentration will not be important environmental fate processes due chloroacetyl chloride's rapid reaction with water. Occupational exposure to chloroacetyl chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where chloroacetyl chloride is produced or used. The general population is not likely to be exposed to chloroacetyl chloride due to its rapid breakdown in the environment. (SRC)",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

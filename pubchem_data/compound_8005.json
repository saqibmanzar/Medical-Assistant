PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Carcinogenesis studies of n-butyl chloride (greater than 99.5% pure) ... was conducted by exposing groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice to n-butyl chloride in corn oil by gavage for ... 2 yr. ... The 2 yr toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of n-butyl chloride were conducted by administering doses of 0, 60, or 120 mg/kg in corn oil by gavage to groups of 50 male and 50 female rats and doses of 0, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg to groups of 50 male and 50 female mice. ... Pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland occurred at a marginally increased incidence in low dose female rats (1/50; 6/50; 1/49). Hyperplasia was observed in 3/50 vehicle controls, 7/50 low dose females, and 4/49 high dose females. The incidence of pheochromocytomas was low, not dose related, and not seen in male rats, and thus it was not considered to be cmpd related. ... An increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined) was observed in the 500 mg/kg/group of female mice (3/50 vs 9/50), but little effect was seen in the 250 mg/kg group (6/50 vs 8/50). ... An increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) was observed in the 500 mg/kg group of female mice (3/50 vs 8/50) but not in the 250 mg/kg (9/50 vs 7/50). ... Under the conditions of these 2 yr gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity of n-butyl chloride for male and female F344/N rats at daily doses of 60 or 120 mg/kg, for male B6C3F1 mice at doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg, or for female B6C3F1 mice at doses of 250 or 500 mg/kg. Chemical-induced toxicity in high dose rats (primarily females) reduced the sensitivity of the study for determining carcinogenicity.",

There is also evidence that it may be formed during chlorination of waste water. n-Butyl chloride has a high vapor pressure and Henry's Law constant. In addition it has a low adsorptivity to soil. Therefore releases to the land or water will partition, to a large extent, to the atmosphere. Limited data suggests that biodegradation is slow. It's rate of hydrolysis is unknown and estimates of its rate from analogous compounds indicate that hydrolysis could not compete with volatilization as a fate process except in groundwater. If released in surface water, the volatilization half-life in a model river and pond are estimated to be 2.9 hr and 34 hr, respectively. In the atmosphere, n-butyl chloride will degrade by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere with a half-life of 7.0 days. Human exposure will be primarily occupational by inhalation and dermal contact. (SRC)",

No rate for neutral hydrolysis of n-butyl chloride is available. Based on extrapolations of hydrolysis rates of analogous compounds determined at higher temperatures and generalizations concerning the relative reactivity of analogs, the hydrolysis half-life of n-butyl chloride at 25 \u00b0C is estimated to lie in the range of 6 hr to 38 days(2). In the atmosphere, n-butyl chloride will react with photchemically produced hydroxyl radicals by H-atom extraction. The estimated rate of reaction is 2.29X10-12 cu cm/molec-sec(3). Assuming a hydroxyl radical concentration of 5X10+5 per cu cm, the half-life of n-butyl chloride in the atmosphere is 7.0 days. n-Butyl chloride does not absorb radiation >290 nm and therefore it will not directly photolyze(4). The half-life of n-butyl chloride in an eutrophic lake due to the photochemical production of hydroxyl radicals in full summer noon sunlight is 1000 hr(1). Therefore, this reaction would not be a significant degradation route for n-butyl chloride in surface waters(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "The NTP technical reports provide the long-term NTP toxicology and carcinogenicity studies that usually involve exposing laboratory animals (rats and mice) to a substance for a period of two years. These studies are designed and conducted to characterize and evaluate the toxicologic potential, including carcinogenic activity, of selected substances. Substances selected for NTP toxicology and carcinogenesis studies are chosen primarily on the basis of human exposure, level of production, and chemical structure. Substance selection is not an indicator of a substance's carcinogenic potential.",

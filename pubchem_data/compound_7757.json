PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For solid alcohol, an inert solvent is used. Catalysts used include strong acids, tertiary amines, salts such as sodium acetate, organophosphorus compounds, and organometallic compounds. /Acetoacetic Esters/",

The benefit or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

No clinical signs observed were considered to be as a result of treatment with the test substance. There were no notable intergroup body weight, food or water consumption differences in either sex. There were no effects noted in hematology, clinical chemistries or urinalyses considered to be toxicologically significant in either sex. There were no intergroup differences in either organ weights, necropsy or histological findings that were considered to be treatment related in either sex. On completion of 4 weeks of dosing all main study animals were sacrificed and necropsied and given a detailed post mortem examination with organs being weighed ( i.e. adrenals, brain, kidney, liver, ovaries and testis with epididymis) and tissues preserved in fixative (i.e. all abnormal tissue, adrenals, brain, ears, eyes, heart, kidney, liver, lung, marrow smear, optic nerve, ovaries, pituitary, spleen stomach, testis with epididymis, thyroid with parathyroid and urinary bladder). Histological examination was carried out on all control and high dose animals. After the 2 week recovery period all recovery study animals were sacrificed and processed in an identical manner.",

Methyl acetoacetate was found in the condensed smoke of fires of ponderosa pine sapwood, needles, bark, litter, duff, and humus. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.892 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates methyl acetoacetate will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase methyl acetoacetate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 5 days. If released to soil, methyl acetoacetate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1.0. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be slow based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.7X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Methyl acetoacetate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. One screening test observed 90% biodegradation of methyl acetoacetate in 2 days; although this study was not specific to soil, it suggests that biodegradation in soil and water may be rapid. If released into water, methyl acetoacetate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be slow based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 3.1 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Methyl acetoacetate does not absorb light with wavelengths >290 nm and is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. Based on an estimated base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 0.57 L/mole-sec, half-lives of 140 and 14 days at pH values of 7 and 8 can be calculated for methyl acetoacetate, respectively. Methyl acetoacetate would be expected to undergo hydrolysis in environmental waters and moist soils under basic conditions. Occupational exposure to methyl acetoacetate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where methyl acetoacetate is produced or used. The general population may be exposed to methyl acetoacetate via inhalation of ambient air containing wood smoke. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

                "Description": "An organic chemistry ontology developed by MolGenie and OntoChem to assign chemical entities to structural classes, split into three main subsections: calculated properties, compounds and substructural concepts. The ontology contains chemistry structural classes with a focus on elements and small organic compounds, but not inorganic, polymer, biopolymer, metal complexes, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and other chemistry entities. The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",

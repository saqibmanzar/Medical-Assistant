ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The spectral features of the spin adducts derived from all three hydrazine derivatives corresponded to the values reported for the methyl free radical adduct of 4-pyridyl-1-oxide-t-butyl nitrone. In the microsomal preparations, inhibitors of the mixed function oxidase system and the destruction of cytochrome P450 by pretreating the rats with cobalt chloride all decreased the free radical formation. Methimazole, an inhibitor of FAD-containing monoxygenase system, similarly decreased the activation of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, but not that of monomethylhydrazine and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. The addition to liver microsomes of physiological concentrations of glutathione (GSH) lowered by approx 80% the intensities of the ESR signals. Consistently, incubation of isolated hepatocytes with methylhydrazine decreased the intracellular GSH content, suggesting that GSH can effectively scavenge the methyl free radicals. The results obtained suggest that methyl free radicals could be the alkylating species responsible for the toxic and/or carcinogenic effect of methylhydrazines.",

Reactive metabolites that were capable of binding covalently to nucleic acids were detected. Biotransformation of methylhydrazine might not be a detoxification process but may produce metabolites that are themselves active. No liver DNA guanine could be methylated in hamsters given the highest feasible doses of methylhydrazine. This does not appear to be an important intermediate in the methylation of DNA guanine seen in hydrazine-treated animals. Monoalkylhydrazines, including methylhydrazine, were converted to the corresponding hydrocarbons in the presence of liver microsomes, oxygen, and energy-producing co-factors. Mixed-function aminooxidases in the liver can oxidize alkylhydrazines in the presence of oxygen and NADPH. The formation of methane from methylhydrazine may be due to the decomposition of an N-oxidation intermediate. ...Methylhydrazine is oxidized by neutrophils (from rat peritoneal exudates) leading to the formation of alkyl radicals. Azide could inhibit this step.",

Oxidation of the nitrogen to nitrogen bond led to the formation of stable azo intermediates in the case of 1,2-disubstituted hydrazines and to unstable monoazo (diazene) metabolites in the case of monosubstituted hydrazines and hydrazides. /Substituted hydrazines/",

Water used to extinguish a fire may cause pollution and should be diked for later disposal. Water may be ineffective in extinguishing fires due to the chemical's low flash point. Because of the wide flammability limits, low flash point, and reignition hazard, dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, water spray, and foam may not be as effective as water dilution of fire area. The vapor is heavier than air; thus it may accumulate sufficiently to flash back. Methylhydrazine fires produce irritating nitrogen oxides. Ignites spontaneously in air when in contact with porous materials (e.g., earth, asbestos, wood, or cloth). Also ignites spontaneously on contact with strong oxidizing agents (e.g., fluorine, chlorine trifluoride, fuming nitric acid, and nitrogen tetroxide). Heat or flame should be avoided because chemical is extremely flammable and explosive. (EPA, 1998)",

AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

Scoop the solid into a container, transport to the fume hood and slowly add to water allowing 20 ml water for each 1 g of methylhydrazine. Filter off the clay and sand. For each 1 g of methylhydrazine, place 41 ml (about 25% excess) of commercial laundry bleach (containing about 5.25% sodium hypochlorite) into a 3-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer and dropping funnel. Add the aqueous methylhydrazine dropwise to the stirred hypochlorite solution, monitoring the rate of addition by rise in temperature. The temperature is maintained at 45-50 \u00b0C and addition takes about 1 hour. Stirring is continued for 2 hours until the temperature gradually falls to room temperature.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

This evaluation is performed by the Dutch Expert Committee on Occupational Standards. The present report contains an evaluation by the committee on the carcinogenicity of N-methylhydrazine. The Committee concludes that N-methylhydrazine should be considered as carcinogenic to humans (comparable with EU-category 2). N-methylhydrazine is genotoxic. Evaluation. No data on humans are available. There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of N-methylhydrazine in experimental animals. Inhalation of N-methylhydrazine induced benign and malignant tumors in mice and hamsters and oral (drinking water) exposure caused benign tumors in mice and malignant tumors in hamsters in one experiment. No tumors were found in rats and dogs following inhalation, but the exposure time in rats may have been too short, that is 1 year instead of 2 years as recommended in OECD guideline 451. There is some evidence for mutagenic activity in in vitro bacterial systems. No mutations were induced in mammalian cell systems, but chromosome and DNA damage have been found. In vivo, N-methylhydrazine was negative in a dominant lethal assay in rats and mice and in a micronucleus test in dogs. Conflicting results were obtained with respect to DNA damage in liver in vivo assessed with the alkaline elution technique. Recommendation for classification. The committee is of the opinion that N-methylhydrazine should be considered as carcinogenic to humans. It is classified as a genotoxic carcinogen (classification comparable with EU category 2).",

Results confirm previous suggestions that both FAD-containing monooxygenase system and P450 are involved in monomethylhydrazine metabolism to carbon dioxide and suggest a similar participation of both systems for production of reactive metabolites interacting with macromolecules.",

Postoperative monomethylhydrazine latencies in 8 naive cats were compared with subsequent after discharge thresholds obtained from basolateral amygdala kindling electrodes. The correlation between those 2 indices was statistically significant. Cats divided on basis of median population value into high or low monomethylhydrazine seizure latencies differed significantly from one another on that index. Animals with prolonged seizure latencies showed significantly higher after discharge thresholds, whereas shorter latencies accompanied lower after discharge thresholds. The gender, weight, electrode impedance or electrode sites of individuals did not account for this relationship. Results suggest endogenous differences in seizure susceptibility that are definable regardless of procedure.",

If released to the atmosphere, methylhydrazine will exist solely in the vapor phase in the ambient atmosphere, based on a measured vapor pressure of 50 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase methylhydrazine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone with estimated half-lives of about 6 hours and 1-12 minutes, respectively. If released to soil, an estimated Koc value of 18 suggests that methylhydrazine will have very high mobility in soil. Methylhydrazine is a weak base having a pKa of 7.87, suggesting that it will partially exist in the protonated form in water and moist soils and the protonated form may adsorb to soils more than the free base. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces will not occur for the protonated species since cations do not volatilize. Volatilization may occur for the neutral species based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. The potential for volatilization of methylhydrazine from dry soils may exist based on the vapor pressure of this compound. Based on limited data, methylhydrazine may degrade in soils and water through a combination of biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Approximately 0%, 5%, 20%, and 8% degradation of methylhydrazine was observed in a 1 hour soil column study using a cleaned sand, sandy soil, organic soil and clay soil, respectively. If released to water, the neutral species of methylhydrazine is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based on the estimated Koc value; however, the protonated form may have greater adsorption. The protonated form will not volatilize, but the free base may volatilize based on the estimated Henry's Law constant. Volatilization half-lives of 5 and 62 days were estimated for a model river and lake, respectively. Methylhydrazine's degradation in water is catalyzed by metal cations such as Cu(II) and Fe(III) which are common in natural waters. The half-life of methylhydrazine present at 9.5 mM in pond and sea water was 18.0 and 24.1 days, respectively, and at 19.0 mM was 13.1 days in both pond and sea water. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure may occur through inhalation or dermal contact at workplaces where methylhydrazine is produced or used. Methylhydrazine has been identified as a constituent in the mushroom Gyrimitia esculenta (considered poisonous and probably should not be eaten in most parts of the world), and the general population may be exposed to methylhydrazine through accidental ingestion and through the inhalation of the cooking vapors that are created during the preparation of these mushrooms.

Methylhydrazine is a weak base with a pKa of 7.87(3). This pKa value indicates that this compound will partially exist as a cation in moist soils, and cations may adsorb to soil more than neutral compounds(SRC). Volatilization of the protonated species from moist soils will not occur since cations do not volatilize. Volatilization of the free base may occur, based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure, 50 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 1X10+6 mg/L(5). Volatilization from dry soils may occur based on the vapor pressure of this compound(4). Approximately 0%, 5%, 20%, and 8% degradation of methylhydrazine was observed in a 1 hour soil column study using a cleaned sand (100% sand), sandy soil (99.1% sand, 0.4% clay, pH 6.1), organic soil (96.1% sand, 1% clay, 1% carbon, pH 6.4) and clay (69.3% sand, 27.95% clay, pH 3.7)(6).",

Methylhydrazine is a weak base with a pKa of 7.87(3). This pKa value indicates that this compound will partially exist as a cation in water, and cations may adsorb to suspended solids and sediment more than neutral compounds(SRC). Volatilization of the protonated species will not occur since cations do not volatilize. Volatilization of the free base may occur(4), based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from its vapor pressure, 50 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 1X10+6 mg/L(6). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(3) is estimated as 5 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(4) is estimated as 62 days(SRC). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from a log Kow of -1.05(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). The estimated half-lives of methylhydrazine present at 9.5 mM in pond and sea water are 18.0 and 24.1 days, respectively, and at 19.0 mM are 13.1 days in both pond and sea water(10).",

Vapor-phase methylhydrazine is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be about 6 hours(SRC) calculated from its rate constant of 6.50X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Assuming an ozone concentration of 7X10+11 molecules/cu cm, a maximum half-life of about 3.3 min for the reaction of methylhydrazine with ozone was estimated from a minimum rate constant of 5X10-15 cu cm/molecule sec(4,SRC). The half-life for the reaction between ozone and methylhydrazine was estimated to be <1 min during ozone pollution episodes and <12 min in the 'natural' troposphere(5).

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Large amounts of methylhydrazine, such as might be released from a spill, are not expected to biodegrade. However, biodegradation of lower methylhydrazine concn may occur(SRC). Methylhydrazine at 500 mg/l, present in a wastewater mixture of hydrazine compounds, was incubated with an inoculum prepared from a trickling filter plant; following a 24 hour lag period, this mixture of compounds was biodegraded as measured by oxygen uptake(2). Contaminated wastewater from the NASA Kennedy Space station was studied in batch cultures and trickle bed reactors to monitor the degradation rates of hydrazine containing rocket fuels(3,4). The half-life of methylhydrazine in batch cultures (Rhodococcus B30 or Achromobacter sp.) and trickle bed reactors was about 2.5 and 12 days, respectively(3). Biodegradation may be a significant removal process at low concentrations in soils or ambient waters, but at higher concentrations hydrazines are toxic to microorganisms(4). Concentrations of hydrazine and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine that reduced bacterial metabolism by 50% ranged from 14.6 to 145 mg/L and from 19.2 to 9,060 mg/L, respectively(5).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 6 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Dark decay of 11.5 ppm methylhydrazine in a 6400 l chamber at 10% relative humidity (RH) and 24 \u00b0C proceeded with a half-life of 19.8 hr(2). Dark decay in a 3800 l chamber of 11.5 ppm methylhydrazine at 10% RH and 24 \u00b0C proceeded with a half-life of 49.8 hr and 10.3 ppm methylhydrazine at 17% RH and 22 \u00b0C proceeded with a half-life of 30.1 hr(2). The products were ammonia and methyldiazene. Ammonia accounted for only 2% and 4% of the methylhydrazine lost in dry and humidified air, respectively(2). The estimated concentration of methyldiazene in the 3800 l chamber experiments was about 0.3 ppm(2). A minimum reaction rate of about 5X10-15 cu cm/molecule sec was obtained for the reaction between methylhydrazine and ozone in a large chamber with 14-28% RH and from 22-24 \u00b0C(2). Assuming an ozone concentration of 7X10+11 molecules/cu cm, the half-life for the reaction of methylhydrazine with ozone is about 3.3 min(SRC). Major products observed were methylhydroperoxide, methyldiazene, formaldehyde, diazomethane and hydrogen peroxide(2). The half-life for the reaction between ozone and methylhydrazine was estimated to be < 1 min during ozone pollution episodes and < 12 min in the 'natural' troposphere(3). The upper limit for the rate of reaction of methylhydrazine with nitrogen dioxide is about 1.4X10-18 cu cm/molecule sec(2). Nitrous oxide does not react significantly with methylhydrazine(2). The lifetime of methylhydrazine in aerosols upon exposure to ozone is about 1 min(4). The aqueous oxidation of methylhydrazine results in methanol, nitromethane and nitrosodimethylamine(4). At a pH of 9.16 and 30 \u00b0C, the first order rate constant for the reaction between dissolved oxygen and methylhydrazine is 5.6X10-3 1/min(5) giving a half-life of about 2 hr(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

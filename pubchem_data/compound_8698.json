This technique is particularly useful to study aromatic, conjugated, and other substances containing a pi bond.  Modern ultraviolet spectrophotometers also cover the visible light range, in which case the technique is called ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

It is released to the environment in wastewaters resulting from its use as a commercial dye carrier. If released to the atmosphere, it will degrade by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals (estimated half-life of 3.25 days). If released to soil or water, biodegradation is expected to be the major degradation process. Two biodegradation screening studies have found butyl benzoate to be readily biodegradable. Leaching in soil is possible. Exposure to the general population occurs through oral consumption of foods that contain butyl benzoate, and from contaminated drinking water and through dermal contact with cloth that contains residual amounts of butyl benzoate remaining from its use as a dye carrier.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

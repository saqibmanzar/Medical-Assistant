The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For the concentration range of 0.335 to 100 ug butylene-oxide/ml whole blood was 93%. At a concentration of 13.4 ug/mL the coefficient of variation for three individual determinations was 2.3%. The corresponding figure at 0.33 ug/ml was 10.4%. No interference peaks were noted. Retention time was approximately 1 minute. In studies designed to simulate the procedure used to collect blood samples from rodents, less than 5% of the butylene oxide was lost when blood was transferred via a syringe and venous cannula. Stability of the spiked blood samples was demonstrated over an 8 hour period using dry ice. As little as 250 microliters of blood were needed for the analysis and detectable concentrations of butylene oxide ranged from 0.335 to 100 ug/mL whole rat blood.",

Irritation and inflammation of the nasal passageways, lungs, and skin have been observed in animal studies following acute inhalation and dermal exposures. Chronic inhalation exposure of rats and mice to 1,2-epoxybutane causes degenerative lesions of the nasal cavity. In a National Toxicology Program (NTP) study, tumors of the nasal cavity and alveolar/bronchial tumors were produced in rats, while no tumors were observed in mice. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 1,2-epoxybutane as a Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans.",

However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place."

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used as an intermediate, for various polymers, a stabilizer for chlorinated solvents, and a corrosion inhibitor.  1-Butene oxide is also used as an acid scavenger for chlorine-containing materials such as trichloroethylene and to react with ammonia to produce alkanolamines.  HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY:  1-Butene oxide is possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). ANIMAL STUDIES:  1-Butene oxide was irritating to the eyes. Irritating effects to the skin were severe (corrosion) if evaporation was minimized due to occlusive application, but there was no effect by semi-occlusive application.  It was not sensitizing in a guinea pig maximization test.  In 90-day inhalation studies with rats and mice 1-butene oxide mainly caused nasal lesions.  Systemic effects occurred at higher concentrations (rat 2400 mg/cu m: decreased mean body weight gain; mice 2400 mg/cu m: e.g. renal tubular necrosis).  There is clear evidence for 1-butene oxide being a locally acting carcinogen in male rats (inhalation of 600 mg/cu m caused no tumors and 1,200 mg/cu m caused neoplasms of the nasal cavity and the lung of male rats) and there is equivocal evidence for a carcinogenic activity in female rats.  There was no evidence for carcinogenic activity in male or female mice.  1-Butene oxide was genotoxic in vitro.  However, it did not cause chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow or dominant-lethal mutations in germ cells of rats.  With respect to reproductive toxicity the 90 day studies with rat and mice did not reveal adverse effects on the reproductive organs up to 2400 mg/kg body weight.  Additionally, the lack of an effect from pre-gestational exposure in the developmental toxicity study and a negative dominant-lethal test may indicate that 1,2-epoxybutane does not reach male and female germ cells in effective concentrations.  No developmental toxicity or teratogenicity was detected in rats after inhalation of up to 3,000 mg/cu m throughout gestation.",

Dosed rats had nonneoplastic lesions of the nasal cavity including inflammation, epithelial hyperplasia, squamous metaplsias, hyperostosis of the nasal turbinate bone, and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium. Seven papillary adenomas of the nasal cavity were seen in high dose male rats and two in high dose female rats. The historical incidences of nasal cavity adenomas in untreated male and untreated female F344/N rats are less than 0.1%. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas (0/50; 1/50; 4/49) and adenomas or carcinomas (combined) (0/50; 2/50; 5/49) were increased in high dose male rats; no increased incidences of these tumors were observed in dosed female rats. Dosed mice had increased incidences of nonneoplastic lesions of the nasal cavity. The nonneoplatic lesions included suppurative inflammation empyema, epithelial hyperplasia, erosion, regeneration, and squamous metaplasia in the nasal cavity; atrophy of the olfactory sensory epithelium; hyperplasia of the nasal gland (Bowman's glands); and inflammation and hyperplasia of the nasolacrimal duct. A single squamous cell papilloma was seen in the incisive duct of one high dose male mouse.",

Observations in mice exposed to 800 ppm included inflammation of the nasal cavity, red discoloration of the lungs, paleness of the spleen, distension of the G.I. tract, thymic necrosis, thymic atrophy, splenic atrophy, splenic necrosis, along with renal tubular necrosis and inflammation. At 200 and 400 ppm mice exhibited a reduction in the number of cell layers in the olfactory epithelium and an increase in amount of serous fluid, especially in the recesses of the turbinate area; but no effects on the thymus, spleen or kidneys.",

Evaporation of 1-butene oxide into the atmosphere is likely to occur as stabilized chlorinated solvents evaporate with their use in metal cleaning and degreasing operations. Its use as an inert ingredient in pesticides for non-food uses may result in its direct release to the environment. 1-Butene oxide may be formed in the ambient atmosphere via reaction of alkenes with atmospheric oxidants. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 170 mm Hg at 24 \u00b0C indicates 1-butene oxide will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-butene oxide will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.4 days. 1-Butene oxide may react with tropospheric aerosols and water to yield 1,2-butanediol through hydrolysis, especially under acidic atmospheric conditions. If released to soil, 1-butene oxide is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 10. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Butene oxide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 100% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil and water. Other screening tests also indicate that 1-butene oxide is readily biodegradable. Some degradation may occur in moist soils via hydrolysis. If released into water, 1-butene oxide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Aerobic aqueous biodegradation screening studies indicate that 1-butene oxide will biodegrade readily. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.9 hours and 4.7 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. 1-Butene oxide has an aqueous hydrolysis half-life of about 6.5 days at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C. In seawater, the hydrolysis rate may be accelerated by at least 30% due to chloride ion reaction. Occupational exposure to 1-butene oxide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-butene oxide is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-butene oxide via inhalation of ambient air. Occupational and consumer exposure are likely where chlorinated solvents are used.

A 100% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(5) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in soil(SRC). Results of various biodegradation screening tests suggest that 1-butene oxide is readily biodegradable(3). 1-Butene oxide has an aqueous hydrolysis half-life of about 6.5 days at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(3,4); therefore, hydrolysis may be an important fate process in moist soils(SRC).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.7X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC) derived from its vapor pressure, 170 mm Hg(4), and its water solubility, 95,500 mg/L(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(2), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 6.9 hours and 4.7 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from its log Kow of 0.68(3) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). A 100% of theoretical BOD using activated sludge in the Japanese MITI test(6) suggests that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Results of various biodegradation screening tests suggest that 1-butene oxide is readily biodegradable(3). The epoxides (such as butene oxide) degrade in water by hydrolysis and related ionic reactions to glycols(7); hydrolysis of 1-butene oxide yields 1,2-butene glycol (also known as 1,2-butanediol)(7). 1-Butene oxide has an aqueous hydrolysis half-life of about 6.5 days at pH 7 and 25 \u00b0C(3,4). In seawater, the hydrolysis rate of the similar 1-propene oxide is accelerated by at least 30% due to chloride ion reaction(7).",

Vapor-phase 1-butene oxide is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is 8.4 days(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.91X10-12 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). Epoxides, such as 1-butene oxide, may be formed in the ambient atmosphere via reaction of alkenes with various atmospheric oxidants(4). 1-Butene oxide may react with tropospheric aerosols and water to yield 1,2-butanediol through hydrolysis, especially under acidic conditions(4).",

In a CO2-Headspace test according to ISO 14593 (activated sludge, domestic, non-adapted), 80-90% degradation of 1-butene oxide was reached within 28 days which classified the compound as readily biodegradable(3,4). Using OECD Guideline 301A (new version, Ready Biodegradability: DOC Die Away Test), 80-90% degradation was reached within 28 days(3,4).

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of 8.4 days at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the reaction of hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solutions at pH 9 is 7.8X10+8 L/mol-sec(3); this corresponds to an aquatic half-life of 2.9 years at an aquatic concentration of 1X10-17 hydroxyl radicals per liter(4). The epoxides (such as butene oxide) degrade in water by hydrolysis and related ionic reactions to glycols(5); hydrolysis of 1-butene oxide yields 1,2-butene glycol (also known as 1,2-butanediol)(5). The hydrolysis rate of 1-butene oxide may be similar to the hydrolysis rate of propene oxide(SRC). Propene oxide has hydrolysis half-lives of 6.6, 11.6, and 11.6 days at respective pHs of 5, 7, and 9 at 25 \u00b0C(5); in seawater, the hydrolysis rate of propene oxide is accelerated by at least 30% due to chloride ion reaction(5). 1-Butene oxide has a reported hydrolysis half-life of 157 hours (6.54 days) at pH 7(6). 2-Butene oxide (2,3-epoxybutane) has a reported hydrolysis half-life of 15.7 days at 25 \u00b0C(7). The acid-catalyzed rate constant of 1-butene oxide was measured as 0.074/M-sec at 24 \u00b0C with 1,2-butanediol as the hydrolysis product(8); this corresponds to a half-life of about 3 years at pH 7(SRC), but it ignores the neutral hydrolysis rate constant.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

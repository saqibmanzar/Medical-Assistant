PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

In rodents and humans exposure to diethylstilbestrol, estrogens, androgens and progestins during critical developmental periods produce morphological and pathological alterations of the reproductive tract of males and females. Diethylstilbestrol treatment causes cancer, infertility and serious morphological abnormalities of the reproductive tract in all species examined.",

In order to circumvent the potentially confounding influences of maternal factors, the direct effects of steroidal and nonsteroidal estrogens on cultured whole embryos were compared at concentrations producing readily measurable embryotoxicity but low embryolethality (2-20%). Nonsteroidal estrogens included were diethylstilbestrol, hexestrol, E,E-dienestrol, and tamoxifen. Steroidal estrogens were estradiol 17 beta, estrone, and 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol 17 beta. For comparative purposes, the effects of two essentially nonestrogenic phenols, Z,Z-dienestrol and phenol, were also studied. Tamoxifen, a weak estrogen which also exhibits antiestrogenic properties, was studied for possible interactive effects with potent estrogens. Prosencephalic hypoplasia was the abnormality most consistently observed and was elicited by each of the chemicals investigated. Embryotoxicity was neither attenuated by tamoxifen nor related to estrogenic potency or steroidal structure, but was strongly and unpredictably influenced by biotransformational determinants. Presence of a cytochrome p450 dependent oxidizing system in the culture medium resulted in marked increases in embryotoxicity of estrone, estradiol 17 beta, and phenol, only minor increases for Z,Z-dienestrol and E,E-dienestrol, but in strikingly decreased effects of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol 17 beta, tamoxifen, and hexestrol. It produced no statistically significant differences in effects of diethylstilbestrol. The results obtained were compatible with the concept that effects of these agents on growth and development during the earlier stages of organogenesis are independent of steroid structure or estrogenic activity but strongly dependent upon pathways and rates of biotransformation of some (but not all) of the parent chemicals.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.  All these various names and identifiers that designate this compound are organized under the Synonyms section.",

The reaction generally starts at elevated temperatures and proceeds exothermically. The second step is the conversion of the monoester to a diester with the formation of water. This is a reversible reaction and proceeds more slowly than the first, thus determining the overall rate of reaction. To shift the equilibrium towards the diester, the water of reaction is removed by distillation. The rate of reaction can be influenced by the choice of catalyst and the reaction temperature. For fast conversion rates, high reaction temperatures are generally used. However, these are influenced by the boiling point of the alcohol and/or the type of catalyst. ... Currently, nearly all major phthalate producers use amphoteric catalysts for the esterification of high boiling alcohols. ... The reaction temperatures for the amphoteric catalysts are about 200 \u00b0C. At this temperature side reactions are minimized, and the alcohol can be recycled without purification. By using this type of catalyst, over 99.5 % conversion to diester can be achieved. /Phthalates/",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 4.77X10-6 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates butyl cyclohexyl phthalate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase butyl cyclohexyl phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 hours. Particulate-phase butyl cyclohexyl phthalate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Butyl cyclohexyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, butyl cyclohexyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 5,100. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data for butyl cyclohexyl phthalate were not available. However, by analogy to dicyclohexylphthalate which reached 68.5% of its theoretical BOD in the Japanese MITI test, butylcyclohexyl phthalate may be subject to biodegradation in the environment. If released into water, butyl cyclohexyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 2,900 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high. However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 5.3 years and 190 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to butyl cyclohexyl phthalate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where butyl cyclohexyl phthalate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to butyl cyclohexyl phthalate via dermal contact with products containing butyl cyclohexyl phthalate. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 9.5X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 2900(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 5.41(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high(SRC). However, bioconcentration studies on compounds which are structurally similar suggest that bioconcentration may be lower than that indicated by the regression-derived equations due to the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(8). Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important process(SRC) based on estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 5.3 years and 190 days at pHs 7 and 8, respectively(9). Biodegradation data for butyl cyclohexyl phthalate were not available(SRC, 2008). However, by analogy to dicyclohexylphthalate which reached 68.5% of its theoretical BOD in the Japanese MITI test(10), butylcyclohexyl phthalate may be subject to biodegradation in the environment(SRC).",

Vapor-phase butyl cyclohexyl phthalate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 23 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 1.7X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase butyl cyclohexyl phthalate may be removed from the air by wet or dry deposition(SRC). Butyl cyclohexyl phthalate does contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(4) and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

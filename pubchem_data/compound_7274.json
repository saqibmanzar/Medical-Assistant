When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

For example, acetone (CH3C(=O)CH3) is also known as propanone, propan-2-one, or dimethyl ketone.  The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Groups of six male and six female rabbits were treated with the test material at dose levels of 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg/day for four weeks. One (recovery) group of male and female rabbits was also treated with 100 mg/kg/day of AMA. No overt signs of toxicity or abnormal behavior were seen among the rabbits during the treatment period. Two females from the 50 mg/kg/day group and two females at the highest dose level died during the course of the study. No mortalities and no significant adverse effects were observed in the low dose and control rabbits. Males treated with the highest dose level exhibited reduced weight gain and lower food consumption. The test material has no significant adverse effects on serum biochemistry, urine and hematological parameters or absolute and relative organ weights. No chemical related gross pathological alterations were observed in any of the organs or tissues examined at the time of necropsy except slight hemorrhage in the fascia of the skin of rabbits treated with 100 mg/kg/day of AMA. There were no significant chemical related microscopic changes found in any of the test rabbits. The animals of the satellite group appeared fully recovered following the 28-day dermal exposure to AMA.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 5.77 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates allyl methacrylate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase allyl methacrylate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 8.4 hours. Allyl methacrylate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, allyl methacrylate is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 110. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.1X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Allyl methacrylate may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 62% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 2 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, allyl methacrylate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5.7 hours and 5.2 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 12 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 9.2X10-3 L/mole-sec was estimated using a structure estimation method; this corresponds to half-lives of 24 and 2.4 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to allyl methacrylate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where allyl methacrylate is produced or used. Use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to allyl methacrylate via dermal contact with this compound. (SRC)",

Bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water. Bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology. Bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical.",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

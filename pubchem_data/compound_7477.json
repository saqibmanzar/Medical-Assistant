PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 0.014 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates p-anisoyl chloride will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase p-anisoyl chloride will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hours. p-Anisoyl chloride absorbs light greater than 290 nm and may be susceptible to direct photolysis; however, the rate of this reaction is not known. If released to soil, p-anisoyl chloride is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 37. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. p-Anisoyl chloride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based on its estimated vapor pressure. No biodegradation data were located for anisoyl chloride. If released into water, p-anisoyl chloride is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 and 50 days, respectively. p-Anisoyl chloride is decomposed in water, but the rate of this reaction is unpublished. However, the hydrolysis half-life of benzoyl chloride, a structural analog, is on the order of several minutes, suggesting that p-anisoyl chloride will undergo rapid hydrolysis in the environment. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to p-anisoyl chloride may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where p-anisoyl chloride is produced or used. (SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.8X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 4 and 50 days, respectively (SRC). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.52(6) and a regression-derived equation(7), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). p-anisoyl chloride is decomposed in water(8), but the rate of this reaction is not known(SRC). However, the hydrolysis half-life of benzoyl chloride, a structural analog, is on the order of several minutes(9), suggesting that p-anisoyl chloride will undergo rapid hydrolysis in the environment(SRC). Biodegradation data were not available(SRC, 2005).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that p-anisoyl chloride is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). However, the hydrolysis half-life of benzoyl chloride, a structural analog, is on the order of several minutes(3), suggesting that p-anisoyl chloride will undergo rapid hydrolysis in the environment. Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 4 days(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 50 days(SRC). p-Anisoyl chloride's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). p-Anisoyl chloride is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon an estimated vapor pressure of 0.014 mm Hg(SRC), determined from a fragment constant method(3).",

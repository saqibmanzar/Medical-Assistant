When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

                                "Description": "This section provides information on the density (with unit) and specific gravity (without unit) of a compound. Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Terphenyl, unspecified isomers, also occurs naturally in petroleum oil. If released to the atmosphere, p-terphenyl will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the ambient atmosphere based on an estimated vapor pressure of 3.4X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C. Vapor-phase p-terphenyl is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 2 days. Particulate-phase p-terphenyl may be physically removed from the air by dry deposition. An estimated Koc of 40000 suggests that p-terphenyl will be immobile in soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mol, but should not be significant from dry soil surfaces given p-terphenyl's vapor pressure. Based on limited pure culture data, p-terphenyl is expected to be resistant to aerobic biodegradation in soil and water. p-Terphenyl should adsorb to suspended matter in the water based on its Koc value. This compound is expected to volatilize from water surfaces given an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole. Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 18 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 5900 suggests that bioconcentration of p-terphenyl will be high in aquatic organisms. The general population may be exposed to p-terphenyl from ingestion of contaminated drinking water, inhalation of contaminated air, or handling of petroleum products. Occupational exposure to p-terphenyl may occur during its production or use in the manufacture of other products. (SRC)",

Based on limited pure culture data, p-Terphenyl may be resistant to biodegradation(SRC). Two bacterial strains of Alcaligenes and Acinetobacter, enriched on biphenyl or 4-chlorobiphenyl, were unable to utilize p-terphenyl as a sole carbon source during a four week period(3). p-Terphenyl should volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3.4X10-5 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), developed using a fragment constant estimation method(4). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 and 18 days, respectively(1,SRC). An estimated BCF value of 5900(1,SRC), determined from a measured water solubility(2), suggests that p-terphenyl will bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC), according to a recommended classification scheme(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

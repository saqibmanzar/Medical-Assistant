ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

These symptoms usually subside within several hours; however, symptomatic and supportive therapy, including hospitalization, may be necessary in some patients. Rash, erythema multiforme, pruritus, urticaria, eosinophilia, and fixed drug eruption have occurred in patients receiving carisoprodol who previously had similar reactions to meprobamate.

The concentrations of carisoprodol and meprobamate were measured in breast milk on 4 consecutive days at steady-state conditions in one woman using carisoprodol 2100 mg/d. The average milk concentrations were 0.9 microg/mL for carisoprodol and 11.6 ug/mL for meprobamate. Based on the milk concentrations measured, the absolute dose ingested by an exclusively breast-fed infant could be estimated at 1.9 mg/kg per day, and the relative dose would be 4.1% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. ...",

We conducted an open three-panel single-dose administration study with 15 healthy volunteers: five poor metabolizers of mephenytoin, five poor metabolizers of debrisoquine and five extensive metabolizers of both substrates. The aim was to investigate if the elimination of carisoprodol and meprobamate is dependent on the two metabolic polymorphisms of mephenytoin and debrisoquine. The subjects were given single oral doses of 700 mg carisoprodol and 400 mg meprobamate on separate occasions. The disposition of carisoprodol was clearly correlated to the mephenytoin hydroxylation phenotype. The mean serum clearance of carisoprodol was four times lower in poor metabolizers of mephenytoin than in extensive metabolizers, which confirms the hypothesis from our previous study that N-dealkylation of carisoprodol cosegregates with the mephenytoin hydroxylation polymorphism. However, mean serum clearance of meprobamate did not differ between the two groups. Also, polymorphic debrisoquine hydroxylation did not influence the elimination of carisoprodol or meprobamate. Poor metabolizers of mephenytoin thus have a lower capacity to metabolize carisoprodol and may therefore have an increased risk of developing concentration dependent side-effects such as drowsiness and hypotension, if treated with ordinary doses of carisoprodol.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

The abuse potential of this drug is attributed to its ability to alter GABAA function. This drug has been shown to modulate a variety of GABAA receptor subunits.  GABAA receptor modulation can lead to anxiolysis due to inhibitory effects on neurotransmission.",

Despite the prevalence of carisoprodol abuse, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Its sedative effects, which contribute to its therapeutic and recreational use, are generally attributed to the actions of its primary metabolite, meprobamate, at GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R). Meprobamate is a controlled substance at the federal level; ironically, carisoprodol is not currently classified as such. Using behavioral and molecular pharmacological approaches, we recently demonstrated carisoprodol, itself, is capable of modulating GABA(A)R function in a manner similar to central nervous system depressants. Its functional similarities with this highly addictive class of drugs may contribute to the abuse potential of carisoprodol. The site of action of carisoprodol has not been identified; based on our studies, interaction with benzodiazepine or barbiturate sites is unlikely. ...",

Co-administration of CYP2C19 inducers, such as rifampin or St. John's Wort, with carisoprodol could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate.

However, there have been post-marketing adverse event reports of Carisoprodol-associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use. To reduce the chance of carisoprodol dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisoprodol should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol, and Carisoprodol should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort.

Death, coma, respiratory depression, hypotension, seizures, delirium, hallucinations, dystonic reactions, nystagmus, blurred vision, mydriasis, euphoria, muscular incoordination, rigidity, and/or headache have been reported with Carisoprodol overdosage. Many of the carisoprodol overdoses have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses (including drugs of abuse, illegal drugs, and alcohol). The effects of an overdose of carisoprodol and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) can be additive even when one of the drugs has been taken in the recommended dosage. Fatal accidental and non-accidental overdoses of carisoprodol have been reported alone or in combination with CNS depressants",

After a 2 wk dose- range-finding study, dose levels for the Task 2 Continuous cohabitation phase were set at 0, 300, 750, & 1500 mg/kg/day, in corn oil gavage. When the high dose killed 2/20 (10%) of males & 4/20 (20%) of females after <1 wk exposure, the high dose level was reduced to 1200 mg/kg/day. During 14 wks of cohabitation in Task 2, with daily dosing of CARI, there was no effect on the ability of the F0 animals to produce litters. However, the proportion of pups born alive, & absolute & adjusted live pup weight, were decreased in the high-dose group compared to the controls. Evaluation of the control & 1200 mg/kg/day dose groups in the Task 3 crossover mating trail (to identify the affected sex) found no effect of CARI on any measure of reproductive function. At F0 necropsy of controls & 1200 mg/kg/d groups, there was no effect of 1200 mg/kg/day CARI on sperm concn, motility, or morphology. Relative right epididymis weight was significantly increased over the control group for high-dose males. Additionally, high-dose males exhibited increased relative liver weight, whereas high-dose females exhibited decreased absolute but not relative kidney/adrenal weight, compared to the controls. There was no effect of CARI on F0 estrous cyclicity. No treatment-related histopathology in the kidney, liver, or reproductive organs was observed in either males or females exposed to 1200 mg/kg/day CARI. Indications of generalized toxicity in the F0 animals included tranquilization, primarily in the high-dose group during the first wks of Task 2, & reduced body weight in high-dose females during Tasks 2 & 3. Mortality (non-gavage related) for the F0 generation was 1/40 (2%), 0/20 (0%), 1/20 (5%), & 9/20 (45%) for males, & 3/40 (7.5%), 1/20 (5%), 1/20 (5%), & 4/20 (20%) for females in the control through high-dose groups. Task 4, a trial to determine the fertility & reproductive competence of the second generation (F1 animals), was conducted with the final offspring of all groups. There was no effect of CARI on indices of mating, pregnancy or fertility, the proportion of pups born alive, the sex ratio of live pups, unadjusted live pup weight, or average number of days to litter. The number of pups/litter (females & the sexes combined) was reduced in the high dose group. Adjusted live pup weight was significantly decreased in the mid- & high-dose groups. At F1 necropsy, there was no effect of treatment on the relative weight of any male or female reproductive organs; spermatid head count was significantly reduced at all levels of CARI. Relative liver weight was significantly increased for females at 300 mg/kg/day & for both males & females at both 750 & 1200 mg/kg/day. There were no treatment-related histopathological changes. Indications of generalized toxicity in the F1 generation included decreased survival of the pups through postnatal day 21 at 750 mg/kg/day CARI (females & sexes combined), 1200 mg/kg/day (sexes combined), & decreased body weight for males at doses of 750 &/or 1200 mg/kg/day, & for females at all dose groups. Only a few animals exhibited transient tranquilization during Task 4. In summary, despite indications of generalized toxicity, only minimal effects of CARI on the reproductive processes were observed in the F0 generation and their offspring at the doses used in this study.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 3.01X10-4 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates carisoprodol will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase carisoprodol will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 11 hours. Particulate-phase carisoprodol will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. Carisoprodol does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm, and therefore is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, carisoprodol is expected to have moderate mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 610. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 7.14X10-10 atm-cu m/mole. Carisoprodol will not volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, carisoprodol is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 17 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Estimated hydrolysis half-lives of 3,000 and 300 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, indicate that hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process. Occupational exposure to carisoprodol may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where carisoprodol is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to carisoprodol via dermal contact with contaminated water or soils irrigated with contaminated treatment plant effluent. Limited exposure will occur via ingestion of medications containing carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant. (SRC)",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 11 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Carisoprodol may undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the presence of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(3). However, estimated rate constants would suggest that hydrolysis is not environmentally relevant(SRC). A base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis rate constant of 7.1X10-5 L/mole-sec(SRC) was estimated using a structure estimation method(2); this corresponds to half-lives of 3,000 and 300 years at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively(2).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The average milk concentrations were 0.9 microg/mL for carisoprodol and 11.6 ug/mL for meprobamate. Based on the milk concentrations measured, the absolute dose ingested by an exclusively breast-fed infant could be estimated at 1.9 mg/kg per day, and the relative dose would be 4.1% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose. ...",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

We aimed to investigate the role of endogenous SO2 in the pathogenesis of ALI. An oleic acid (OA)-induced ALI rat model was established. Endogenous SO2 levels, lung injury, oxidative stress markers and apoptosis were examined. OA-induced ALI rats showed a markedly downregulated endogenous SO2/aspartate aminotransferase 1 (AAT1)/AAT2 pathway and severe lung injury. Chemical colorimetry assays demonstrated upregulated reactive oxygen species generation and downregulated antioxidant capacity in OA-induced ALI rats. However, SO2 increased endogenous SO2 levels, protected against oxidative stress and alleviated ALI. Moreover, compared with OA-treated cells, in human alveolar epithelial cells SO2 downregulated O2(-) and OH(-) generation. In contrast, L-aspartic acid-beta-hydroxamate (HDX), an inhibitor of endogenous SO2 generating enzyme, promoted free radical generation, upregulated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase expression, activated caspase-3, as well as promoted cell apoptosis. Importantly, apoptosis could be inhibited by the free radical scavengers glutathione (GSH) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). The results suggest that SO2/AAT1/AAT2 pathway might protect against the development of OA-induced ALI by inhibiting oxidative stress.",

But it has been found to be endogenously generated from metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids in mammals through transamination by aspartate aminotransferase (AAT). SO2 could be produced in cardiovascular tissues catalyzed by its synthase AAT. In recent years, studies revealed that SO2 had physiological effects on the cardiovascular system, including vasorelaxation and cardiac function regulation. In addition, the pathophysiological effects of SO2 were also determined. For example, SO2 ameliorated systemic hypertension and pulmonary hypertension, prevented the development of atherosclerosis, and protected against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury. These findings suggested that endogenous SO2 was a novel gasotransmitter in the cardiovascular system and provided a new therapy target for cardiovascular diseases.",

The biological half-times range from days to years depending on their chemical composition.  Soluble particles may dissolve in the mucous or aqueous lining of the lungs.

Two factors affecting the efficiency of absorption are the mode of breathing (oral versus oronasal) and ventilation rate. The nose filters out most inhaled sulfur dioxide, preventing its passage to sensitive irritant receptors at and below the larynx. At rest, most people (about 85%) breathe through the nose, providing protection against the pulmonary toxicity of sulfur dioxide. Mouth breathing, particularly at higher airflow rates, substantially increases the fraction of sulfur dioxide reaching the lung. Thus, voluntary hyperventilation or exercise at a level of exertion requiring oronasal breathing lowers the threshold for sulfur dioxide-induced respiratory symptoms and bronchomotor responsiveness. Deep lung penetration and toxicity are enhanced by oxidation and adsorption to submicrometer acidic particles.",

L-cysteine is catalyzed by cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) to L-cysteine sulfinate, which converts to beta-sulfinylpyruvate through transamination by aspartate aminotransferase (AAT), and finally spontaneously decomposes to pyruvate and SO(2). The present study explored endogenous SO(2) production, and AAT and CDO distribution in different rat tissue. SO(2) content was highest in stomach, followed by tissues in the right ventricle, left ventricle, cerebral gray matter, pancreas, lung, cerebral white matter, renal medulla, spleen, renal cortex and liver. AAT activity and AAT1 mRNA expression were highest in the left ventricle, while AAT1 protein expression was highest in the right ventricle. AAT2 and CDO mRNA expressions were both highest in liver tissue. AAT2 protein expression was highest in the renal medulla, but CDO protein expression was highest in liver tissue. In all tissues, AAT1 and AAT2 were mainly distributed in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. These observed differences among tissues endogenously generating SO(2) and associated enzymes are important in implicating the discovery of SO(2) as a novel endogenous signaling molecule.",

Exposure to this strong-smelling, colorless gas or liquid (compressed gas) may occur from its use as a fumigant, as an intermediate in the manufacture of sulfuric acid and other sulfur compounds, in oil, mineral, food and paper processing, and in water treatment. Effects from exposure may include contact burns to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes, frostbite, bronchoconstriction, and pulmonary edema. Engineering controls, including local exhaust ventilation, should be used to maintain sulfur dioxide at or below the permissible limit.  In activities and situations where over-exposure may occur, wear chemical protective clothing and a self-contained breathing apparatus.  If contact should occur, immediately remove contaminated clothing (to be left at worksite for cleaning), irrigate exposed eyes with copiousamounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, flush exposed skin with water, and treat for possible frostbite.  Emergency eyewash facilities should be available in sulfur dioxide work areas. While sulfur dioxide does not ignite easily, it may burn, and cylinders of the compressed material can explode in the heat of a fire.  For fires involving sulfur dioxide, extinguish with dry chemical, CO2, Halon, water spray, fog, or standard foam.  If water is used, apply from as far a distance as possible because material will react with water to form toxic and corrosive fumes. Sulfur dioxide may be shipped domestically via air (cargo only), rail (cargo only), road, and water, in containers bearing the label, \"Nonflammable gas.\"  Sulfur dioxide should be stored in tightly closed containers, in cool, well-ventilated areas, and away from sources of physical damage.  For spills of liquid sulfur dioxide, first evacuate area for 50 feet in all directions, use water spray to reduce vapor, and neutralize spilled material with limestone, soda ash, or lime. Keep material from entering water sources and sewers.  Before implementing land disposal of sulfur dioxide waste, consult with environmental regulatory agencies for guidance.",

The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

Supports combustion of powdered aluminum [Mellor 5:209-212 1946-47]. Reacts explosively with fluorine [Mellor 2:1 1946-47]. Supports burning of manganese [Mellor 12:187 1946-47]. Readily liquefied by compression. Contact between the liquid and water may result in vigorous or violent boiling and extremely rapid vaporization. If the water is hot an explosion may occur. Pressures may build to dangerous levels if the liquid contacts water in a closed container [Handling Chemicals Safely 1980]. Supports incandescent combustion of monocesium acetylide, monopotassium acetylide, cesium oxide, iron(II) oxide, tin oxide, and lead oxide [Mellor]. Ethylene oxide and SO2 can react violently in pyridine solution with pressurization if ethylene oxide is in excess (Nolan, 1983, Case History 51).",

SO2 is used as a fungicide and preservative for grapes. It is also used for the manufacture of corn syrups and molasses, in the manufacture of wine to destroy bacteria, mold, and unwanted yeasts, and for sterilization, and prevents the formation of nitrosamines in beer. SO2 is used to manufacture hydrosulfites, to bleach wood pulp and paper, to process, disinfect, and bleach food, for waste and water treatment, in metal and ore refining, and in oil refining. HUMAN STUDIES: Exposures of less than an hour to SO2 at levels above 10 ppm in air are irritating to the nose and throat, sometimes causing a choking sensation followed by nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, and increased mucous secretion. Severe injuries of human eyes by sulfur dioxide have been produced only by liquified form. The minimum lethal human exposure is an airborne concentration of 400 ppm for 1 minute. The odor or taste is noticeable at airborne concentrations of 3 to 5 ppm, throat and conjunctival irritation and lacrimation start at 8 to 12 ppm, and symptoms become severe at 50 ppm. Other reported minimum lethal concentrations of sulfur dioxide include 3000 ppm for 5 minutes and 1000 ppm for 10 minutes. Elderly patients with asthma may be more sensitive. A 76-year-old woman with asthma died following inhalation exposure to approximately 150 ppm over a period of minutes. The frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 40 workers chronically exposed to SO2 at a sulfuric acid factory were studied. It was shown that the mean frequency of chromosomal aberrations and the mean frequency of lymphocytes with chromosomal aberrations of the SO2-exposed workers were both higher than controls. In human lymphocytes SO2 caused significant increases in the frequency of sister chromatid exchange and micronuclei and also induced mitotic delays and decreased mitotic index and replication index. The potential risk of low birth-weight baby might be higher in elder women exposed to SO2 during pregnancy. ANIMAL STUDIES: SO2 has been found to be endogenously generated from metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids in mammals through transamination by aspartate aminotransferase. SO2 has physiological effects on the cardiovascular system, including vasorelaxation and cardiac function regulation. Eye irritation occurs at 6 ppm/4 hr in rabbits. After a 120-hr exposure to SO2 concentration of 1.1 ppm, guinea pigs showed proliferative interstitial pneumonia, bronchitis, and tracheitis and an increased histamine content in the lungs, while exposure to 0.06 ppm of SO2 for one month led to interstitial changes in the respiratory tract. In rats continuously exposed to SO2 for 5 months (0.7 ppm and 7.0 ppm), it increased the activity of serum cholinesterase and aspartate aminotransferase and caused morphological changes in the upper respiratory tract. Prolonged exposure of dogs to high concentrations of SO2 (200 ppm) causes a syndrome similar to human chronic bronchitis, involving chronic airway obstruction, airway inflammation, and symptoms of cough and mucus hypersecretion. In mice, fetal weight was reduced by 5% by exposure to SO2. Ossification of the sternebrae and occipital was retarded, but the incidence of malformations was not significantly increased. In rabbits, the incidence of a few minor skeletal variants was significantly increased in group exposed to SO2. SO2 increased the frequencies of chromosome aberrations and aberrant cells in mouse bone marrow in a dose-dependent manner. SO2 inhalation caused an increase of micronuclei frequencies in the polychromatic erythrocytes. SO2 caused significant, dose-dependent increases in DNA damage by inhalation exposure of mice. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: SO2 was acutely toxic to fish. Green plants are extremely sensitive to atmospheric sulfur dioxide. Alfalfa, barley, cotton, and wheat can be injured at levels between 0.15 and 0.20 ppm, while potatoes, onions, and corn are far more resistant.",

In lungs of rats exposed to SO2 alone, the gene transcription of CYP1A1 and 1A2, the EROD and MROD activities were decreased. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein levels of c-jun and c-fos were increased significantly. Exposure to B(a)P alone induced CYP1A1, CYP1A2 mRNA levels, the protein levels of c-jun, and the EROD and MROD activities in lungs. However, exposure to B(a)P plus inhaled SO2 neither increased nor decreased CYP1A1/2 mRNA expressions, EROD, and MROD activities in lungs, versus exposure to B(a)P alone. Nevertheless, exposure to B(a)P plus inhaled SO2 increased the mRNA and protein levels of c-jun and c-fos in lungs compared with lungs exposed to SO2 alone. Accordingly, the SO2-induced decreases of CYP1A1/2 might not influence the metabolic activation of B(a)P. However, when B(a)P and SO2 were given in the combinations, one might postulate that a synergistic effect on the expressions of c-fos and c-jun between SO2 and B(a)P, which might be one of the possible mechanisms of combination effects between B(a)P and the air pollutants.",

The exposure of SO2 caused significant elevation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) levels and reduction of enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) in brain and liver, accompanied by a decrease in relative growth rate, when compared with controls. Application of moderate concentrations of SA and Vit C markedly reduced the SO2-induced elevation of TBARS levels, with 5.5 mg/kg SA or 200 mg/kg Vit C being most effective. In contrast to the decrease of TBARS levels, the levels of SOD, POD, and CAT in liver and brain were significantly increased in comparison with controls. The polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of total liver proteins showed that the SO2 inhalation caused a 30-kD protein band disappearance compared with the control. However, the band remained unchanged in the samples treated with 5.5 and 8.25 mg/kg SA or 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg Vit C. Therefore, this protein band may serve as a marker for the damage induced by SO2 and an additional basis for drug screening and selection.",

These examinations should be directed toward complaints of mucous membrane irritation, cough and shortness of breath. They should ascertain that nasal passages are open. Persons with a history of asthma or with subnormal pulmonary function should be watched closely. Simple expiratory function tests should be a part of the examination. They are useful for several purposes: (a) determining whether or not a person is a suitable candidate for using respirators; (b) identifying \"reactors\", ie, persons who may be most susceptible to the effects of SO2. This can be done by comparing preshift and postshift tests; (c) when done periodically, they can be used to determine whether or not a person's expiratory functions are declining at a faster than normal rate. Such determinations are much more sensitive when pooled data from a number of individuals are used. The forced expiratory volume at 1 second and the maximum mid-expiratory flow rate appear to be the most useful of the simple pulmonary function tests."

The procedure was designed to increase dosage to the laryngotracheobronchial airways. In one subject, there was a threefold increase in specific airway flow resistance with this procedure. As expected, sulfur dioxide at 3 ppm elicited greater changes in function than did 1 ppm. The magnitudes of these changes were proportional to the numbers of deep breaths taken.",

When breathed alone, 0.37 ppm of sulfur dioxide had no effect on any measurement of lung function; 0.37 ppm of ozone produced a just significant decline of ventilatory function at the end of a 2 hr exposure. However, when the two gases were present together in eight normal young subjects who were non-smokers, the maximal mid-expiratory flow rate dropped to 67% of its initial value at the end of 2 hr; the forced expiratory volume was 78% of its initial value, and the mid-expiratory flow rate (50% vital capacity) was only 54% of the initial value. A 2 hr exposure to 0.75 ppm of sulfur dioxide alone dropped the maximal mid-expiratory flow rate to 90% of its control value. /It was/ concluded that sulfur dioxide and ozone are exceedingly corrosive when present together, that \"standard\" must specify the presence or absence of the other, and that there is a growing incidence of the joint presence of the two pollutants in urban environments. /Air pollution/",

SO(2) caused dose-dependent changes in breathing parameters in both strains with SH rats being slightly more affected than SD rats. Increases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) total cells and neutrophilic inflammation were dose dependent and significantly greater in SH than in SD rats. The recovery was incomplete at 4 days following SO(2) exposure in SH rats. Pulmonary protein leakage was modest in either strain, but lactate dehydrogenase and N-acetyl glucosaminidase activity were increased in BALF of SH rats. Airway pathology and morphometric evaluation of mucin demonstrated significantly greater impact of SO(2) in SH than in SD rats. Baseline differences in lung gene expression pattern suggested marked immune dysregulation, oxidative stress, impairment of cell signaling, and fatty acid metabolism in SH rats.

Captive adult female American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were exposed to a mixture of benzene (0.6 ppm), toluene (1 ppm), nitrogen dioxide (NO2; 2 ppm) and sulfur dioxide (SO2; 5.6 ppm), in a whole-body inhalation chamber. Thyroid axis responses to meet metabolic demands were examined through thyroid histology, plasma thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3), and hepatic outer ring deiodination (T4-ORD). Plasma free (F) T3 and T4 were measured at baseline, and at 9 days and 18 days of exposure, whereas total (T) T3 and TT4, thyroid histology and hepatic T4-ORD were determined at the final 18 day exposure. Inhalation of these contaminants significantly suppressed plasma FT4 and TT4, and depleted follicular colloid and increased epithelial cell height at 18 days, and significantly altered the temporal pattern of plasma FT4. Significant histological changes in the follicular colloid:epithelial cell height ratio indicated sustained T4 production and release by the thyroid glands. There was no effect on plasma FT3, TT3, or hepatic T4-ORD. We hypothesize that contaminant-related activation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in the kestrels increased elimination of plasma T4 through Phase II enzymes.",

Captive Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica) and American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were exposed to mixtures of volatile organic compounds and oxidizing agents (benzene, toluene, NO2 and SO2) in a whole-body inhalation chamber, to test for toxicological responses. Hepatic biotransformation measured through 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) tended to be increased in exposed kestrels (p=0.06) but not in quail (p=0.15). Plasma corticosterone was increased in the low dose group for quail on the final day of exposure (p=0.0001), and midway through the exposure period in exposed kestrels (p=0.04). For both species, there was no alteration of T and B-cell responses, immune organ mass, or histology of immune organs (p>0.05).",

The objective of our study was to determine the effects of the exposure of oak pollens (Quercusmongolica) to several concentrations of NO2 or SO2. Pollen grains were exposed to 0.5 ppm to 5.0 ppm NO2 or SO2 for 4 hours and assessed for morphological damage by field emission scanning electron microscopy and for viability using the trypan blue stain. Morphological changes in pollen grains were also examined after contact with acid solutions at pH 4.0 to pH 7.0. Exposure to NO2 or SO2 significantly damaged pollen grains at all concentrations investigated, compared to exposure to air; with exposure to concentrations of 0.5 ppm to 2 ppm resulting in fissures or complete breaks in the exine and a concentration of 5 ppm resulting in complete breakdown and release of pollen cytoplasmic granules. Significantly greater amounts of pollen grain were damaged after exposure to SO2 (15.5-20.4%) than after exposure to NO2 (7.1-14.7%). Similarly, exposure to NO2 or SO2 significantly decreased the viability of pollen grains, compared with exposure to air; with SO2 being slightly more detrimental than NO2. Exposure to acid solutions also induced pollen damage, which appeared to be pH-dependent (from 24.6% at pH 6.0 to 55.8% at pH 4.0; compared to 3.8% at pH 7.0). Short-term exposure of oak pollen to high concentrations of SO2 or NO2 significantly increases their fragility and disruption, leading to subsequent release of pollen cytoplasmic granules into the atmosphere. These results suggest that heightened air pollution during the oak pollen season may possibly increase the incidence of allergic airway disease in sensitized individuals by facilitating the bioavailability of airborne pollen allergens.",

On a global basis, fossil fuel combustion accounts for 75 to 85% of man-made sulfur dioxide emissions, and industrial processes such as refining and smelting account for the remainder. The global sulfur cycle involves an atmospheric flux of about (140-350)X10+6 tons/annum, with (40-60)X10+6 tons as anthropogenic sulfur, in the form of sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, and sulfate. Sulfur dioxide can react with other compounds in the atmosphere and form fine particles that result in haze that reduces visibility. Particulate matter pollution is the major cause of haze in parts of the US. Sulfur dioxide's production and use in preserving fruits, vegetables; disinfectant in breweries and food factories; bleaching textile fibers, straw, wicker ware, gelatin, glue, beet sugars, solvent and reagent in organic synthesis may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. It's use as a fungicide and acaricide in the wine industry will result in its direct release to the environment. Sulfur dioxide is released to the air from volcanic activity and eruptions. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 3.0X10+3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates sulfur dioxide will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase sulfur dioxide is oxidized rapidly by homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. The oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid and sulfates in the atmosphere is an important contributor to air pollution, specifically producing acid rain. Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water, forming a weak acid solution of sulfurous acid. This acid rain effects sensitive forest, soil and aquatic ecosystems. The atmospheric lifetime of sulfur dioxide is about 10 days. Sulfur dioxide may be photochemically or catalytically oxidized to SO3 and sulfate in air. If released to soil, sulfur dioxide is expected to absorb to soil. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 8.10X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Sulfur dioxide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Sulfur dioxide has been shown to be reduced to H2S using heat- and alkali-treated sewage sludge by certain sulfate reducing bacteria. If released into water, sulfur dioxide is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its rapid reaction with water to form sulfuric acid. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's reactivity with water. Occupational exposure to sulfur dioxide may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where sulfur dioxide is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to sulfur dioxide via inhalation of ambient air, smoking cigarettes, ingestion of food, and dermal contact with consumer products containing sulfur dioxide.

Sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is formed as a by-product of fuel combustion from power generation and industrial processes, and by the oxidation of reduced gases in the air(2). Sulfur dioxide can react with other compounds in the atmosphere and form fine particles that result in haze that reduces visibility. Particulate matter pollution is the major cause of haze in parts of the world(3). Sulfur dioxide's production and use for preserving fruits, vegetables; disinfectant in breweries and food factories; bleaching textile fibers, straw, wicker ware, gelatin, glue, beet sugars, solvent and reagent in organic synthesis(4) may result in its release to the environment through various waste streams. It's use as a fungicide and acaricide in the wine industry will result in its direct release to the environment(5). Sulfur dioxide is a constituent of tobacco smoke(6).",

Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water, forming a weak acid solution of sulfurous acid. This acid rain effects sensitive forest, soil and aquatic ecosystems. Sulfur in precipitation is, up to a point, beneficial to plant growth as sulfur is an essential element. At low levels, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is not harmful to crops but damage can occur at high levels. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments were designed to cut annual sulfur dioxide emissions 40% from 1980 levels, and thereby decrease the effects of acid rain, which can cause damage at great distances from the source of emission. Estimated emissions in the USA declined from 25.7X10+6 tons in 1980 to approximately 20X10+6 tons in 2006; approximately 65% of emissions is attributable to electric utilities. Regulatory action to limit sulfur emissions is applicable to power generation, the selection of fuel and the coal mining, gas and petroleum industries. A large part of the amount of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is attributed to burning sulfur-containing fuel, notably coal, and smelting sulfide ores(1).",

When applied as a pesticide, SO2 may be transported, deposited, or transformed in various chemical reactions. SO2 participates in the sulfur biogeochemical cycle, which involves complex reactions of sulfur-containing compounds between abiotic and biotic components of ecosystems. The main degradation route of SO2 is atmospheric oxidation, and sulfur oxides may undergo long-distance transport prior to removal from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. According to the Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) database maintained by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), SO2 use in California from 2010 to 2015 was primarily for fumigations (96%), including treatments of postharvest grape products and winery equipment sterilizations. Other site uses contributed less than 5% of reported statewide SO2 use from 2010 to 2015. A slight increasing trend in use of SO2 as a pesticide was observed from 2010 to 2015, with the highest reported uses of SO2 within California counties during the months of July-November. Although the primary sources of SO2 in the environment are anthropogenic emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, emissions of SO2 from pesticide uses have the potential to contribute to the environmental and public welfare impacts of SO2 pollution. Oxidation of atmospheric SO2 may contribute to the negative environmental and public welfare impacts of acid rain, which include toxicity to aquatic organisms, fish, and terrestrial vegetation, and corrosion of man-made materials.",

However, reaction with water to sulfuric acid is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Sulfur dioxide is expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 3.0X10+3 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(3). Biodegradation data in soil were not available(SRC, 2018).

Radicals, e.g. hydrogen monoxide, water, and carboxcylic acid, appear to be the principal species responsible for the homogeneous oxidation of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere, which occurs at rates as high as 4.0%/hr(1). Sulfur dioxide is oxidized rapidly by homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions and is removed from the atmosphere by precipitation and by dry deposition on surfaces, mainly as sulfuric acid(2). Sulfur dioxide in air can be oxidized to sulfate by cloud or rain droplets and thus form \"acid rain\"(1). Meteorologic conditions resulted in high acidic pollution during the summer months in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky. The EPA Acid Rain Program projected a 40% reduction in sulfur dioxide yearly emissions in the US between 1980 and 2010, which would also contribute to less sulfate haze(2). Sulfur dioxide may be photochemically or catalytically oxidized to SO3 and sulfate in air. The atmospheric lifetime of sulfur dioxide is about 10 days(2).  .",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

The mass emission factors have been theoretically calculated using the basic principles of combustion under representative prevailing operating conditions in the plants and fuel composition. The results show that from 2001/02 to 2009/10 period, total CO2 emissions have increased from 324 to 499 Mt/year; SO2 emissions have increased from 2,519 to 3,840 kt/year; and NO emissions have increased from 948 to 1,539 kt/year from the Indian coal-fired power plants. National average emissions per unit of electricity from the power plants do not show a noticeable improvement during this period. Emission efficiencies for new plants that use improved technology are found to be better than those of old plants. As per these estimates, the national average of CO2 emissions per unit of electricity varies between 0.91 and 0.95 kg/kWh while SO2 and NO emissions vary in the range of 6.9 to 7.3 and 2.8 to 2.9 g/kWh, respectively. Yamunagar plant in Haryana state showed the highest emission efficiencies with CO2 emissions as 0.58 kg/kWh, SO2 emissions as 3.87 g/kWh, and NO emissions as 1.78 g/kWh, while the Faridabad plant has the lowest emission efficiencies with CO2 emissions as 1.5 kg/kWh, SO2 emissions as 10.56 g/kWh, and NO emissions as 4.85 g/kWh. Emission values at other plants vary between the values of these two plants.",

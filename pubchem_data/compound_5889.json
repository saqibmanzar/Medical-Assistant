PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

The results indicated that PAHs were not accumulated by trout through dietary exposure because of the combined effects of poor absorption efficiencies and rapid elimination rates. ...",

This receptor is widely distributed and has been detected in most cells and tissues. There is also evidence that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor acts through a variety of pathways and, more recently, that cross-talk with other nuclear receptors enables cell type-specific and tissue-specific control of gene expression. Translocation of the activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor to the nucleus may require threshold concentrations of the ligand. Various oxidative and electrophilic PAH metabolites are also known to induce enzyme systems via anti-oxidant receptor elements. The biological effects of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and anti-oxidant receptor element signalling involve a variety of cellular responses, including regulation of phase I and II metabolism, lipid peroxidation, production of arachidonic acid-reactive metabolites, decreased levels of serum thyroxine and vitamin A and persistent activation of the thyroid hormone receptor. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signalling may result in adaptive and toxic responses or perturbations of endogenous pathways. Furthermore, metabolic activation of PAHs produces cellular stress. This in turn activates mitogen mediated protein kinase pathways, notably of Nrf2. The Nrf2 protein dimerizes with Maf oncoproteins to enable binding to an anti-oxidant/electrophilic response element, which has been identified in many phase I/II and other cellular defense enzymes and controls their expression. Therefore, cellular stress may be regulated independently of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

Each provides a different explanation for the data observed in experimental animals. The diol epoxide mechanism features a sequence of metabolic transformations of PAHs, each of which leads to potentially reactive genotoxic forms. In general, PAHs are converted to oxides and dihydrodiols, which are in turn oxidized to diol epoxides. Both oxides and diol epoxides are ultimate DNA-reactive metabolites. PAH oxides can form stable DNA adducts and diol epoxides can form stable and depurinating adducts with DNA through electrophilic carbonium ions. The inherent reactivities of oxides and diol epoxides are dependent on topology (e.g. bay regions, fjord regions, cyclopenta rings), and the reactivity of diol epoxides is further dependent on factors such as stereochemistry and degree of planarity. Both stable and depurinating adducts are formed primarily with guanines and adenines, and induce mutations (e.g. in ras proto-oncogenes) that are strongly associated with the tumorigenic process. Some mutagenic PAH diols, oxides and diol epoxides are tumorigenic in experimental animals. One-electron oxidation creates radical cations at a specific position on some PAHs. The ease of formation and relative stabilities of radical cations are related to the ionization potential of the PAH. Additional important factors in the radical cation mechanism are localization of charge in the PAH radical cation and optimal geometric configuration, particularly the presence of an angular ring. The radical cation mechanism results in the formation of depurinating DNA adducts with guanines and adenines, which generate apurinic sites that can induce mutations in ras proto-oncogenes, which are strongly associated with tumorigenesis. /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/"

                                "Description": "The threshold limit value (TLV) of a chemical is an airborne concentration at which a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effect.  There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

The OELs for chemical substances are established based on the chemical properties of the substance, experimental studies on animals and humans, toxicological and epidemiological data. These limits are set out by many professional organizations and government agencies around the world, such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States. Different organizations may use different terminology for the OEL. For example, the ACGIH term for OEL is \"Threshold Limit Value\" (TLV)\u00ae while the NIOSH term is \"recommended exposure limits\" (REL). This section also includes MAK (maximale arbeitsplatzkonzentration), similar to threshold limit value, specifies the maximum concentration level of a toxic substance in air at a workplace.",

HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: DBA is a probable human carcinogen. Neuroblastoma risk in a child was increased with higher maternal exposure to DBA. ANIMAL STUDIES: Addition of DBA to food for a total dose of 9-19 mg over a period of 5-7 months in mice led to the appearance of tumors of the forestomach in 7/22 survivors after 1 year; 1 of these tumors was a carcinoma. In a later experiment, 20 back-cross mice receiving 0.4 mg DBA per day orally developed 2 squamous cell carcinomas and 11 papillomas of the forestomach within 406 days. In a similar experiment tumors were produced in the lung, heart, and intestine. Squamous carcinomas of forestomach were induced if emulsion was stabilized against the breaking effect of gastric juices.  No tumors were seen among 10 Syrian golden hamsters receiving 20 applications of 0.2% solutions DBA over a period of 10 weeks, 5 of which were alive at 50 weeks. DBA was positive in differential survival assays using DNA-repair-proficient/-deficient strains of bacteria and was mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium with metabolic activation. In cultured mammalian cells DBA was mutagenic and induced unscheduled DNA synthesis with metabolic activation. It was positive in assays for morphological transformation. In the one available study, it induced sister chromatid exchange but not chromosomal aberrations in vivo. Carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can produce an immunosuppressive effect. This was first observed in administration of high doses of 3-methylcholanthrene and DBA to mice. DBA has a \"bay-region\" structure. It is metabolized by mixed-function oxidases to dihydrodiols that are mutagenic in bacteria and tumorigenic in mouse skin painting assays and when injected into newborn mice. The influence of near-ultraviolet light (UVA) on the DBA cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in larvae of the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl was evaluated and DBA was not found to be clastogenic. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Of 121 pigeons which received intramuscular injections of 3 mg DBA were observed for 13 months, 14 developed fibrosarcoma at the injection site. No tumors were found among 32 untreated controls. Intramuscular injection of 0.4% DBA in lard induced sarcomas in 15/31 fowl within 45 months. Injection of 0.3-0.5 mg DBA in olive oil into the kidney of frogs (Rana pipiens) produced renal adenocarcinomas in 26% of survivors compared with 3% of controls.",

These enzymes metabolize PAH's into their toxic intermediates.

The influence of near-ultraviolet light (UVA) on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of 7 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in larvae of the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl /was evaluated/. Benz[a]anthracene (BA), 7,12-benz[a]anthraquinone (BAQ) and anthracene (Ac) proved to be lethal at low doses (some ppb), and the following order of genotoxicity was observed: BA approximately BAQ > DMBA > DMA (9,10-dimethylanthracene). Ac, AQ (9,10-anthraquinone) and DBA (dibenz[a,h]anthracene) were not found to be clastogenic. In the larvae reared in normal conditions (subdued natural daylight/darkness alternation) or in continuous darkness, the BA derivatives were shown to be more genotoxic than BA itself: DMBA > BAQ > BA; BA (>/= 187.5 ppb) slightly increased the level of micronuclei in circulating erythrocytes, while DMBA was strongly clastogenic, in line with their reported carcinogenicity. In other experiments, rearing media alone (i.e., water containing BA, BAQ or DMBA) were UVA-irradiated for 24 hr, and then tested on larvae in the dark ('IR-UV/dark' conditions). Photodegradation of BA (50 and 100 ppb) gave rise to clastogenic products. By contrast, DMBA (12.5, 25 or 50 ppb) was destroyed by UVA, and we suggested that any potentially mutagenic photoproducts formed were not in sufficient amounts to yield a positive response in the newt micronucleus test.",

It was not possible to demonstrate an inhibitory action of most of the weak-to-inactive hydrocarbons; on the contrary, an additive effect of the two types could be observed. At very high doses (almost 10 times higher than the highest doses selected in the rest of the trial) the group of substances which were supposed to be non-carcinogenic also proved to be biologically effective.",

When the comet assay was performed in the dark or when yellow fluorescent lamps were used for illumination the DNA-damaging effect of the 11 PAHs disappeared. White fluorescent lamps exhibit emission maxima at 334.1, 365.0, 404.7, and 435.8 nm representing spectral lines of mercury. In the case of yellow fluorescent lamps these emissions were absent. Obviously, under standard laboratory illumination many PAHs are photo-activated, resulting in DNA-damaging species. This feature of PAHs should be taken into account when these compounds are employed for the initiation of skin cancer. ...",

In this study, we examined maternal exposure to ambient air toxics in pregnancy in relation to neuroblastoma in the child. We ascertained all cases of neuroblastoma listed in the California Cancer Registry 1990-2007 that could be linked to a California birth certificate, and controls were selected at random from California birth records. Average air toxics exposures during pregnancy were determined based upon measures from community-based air pollution monitors. The study included 75 cases and 14,602 controls who lived with 5 km of an air pollution monitor, and we additionally examined results for those living within a smaller radius around the monitor (2.5 km). Logistic regression was used to determine the risk of neuroblastoma with one interquartile range increase in air toxic exposure. Neuroblastoma risk was increased with higher maternal exposure to carbon tetrachloride (OR=2.65, 95%CI 1.07, 6.53) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (OR=1.39, 95%CI 1.05, 1.84), particularly indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and dibenz(a,h)anthracene. ...",

Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is currently used as the main indicator of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air pollution, but there is concern that B[a]P may not be the ideal surrogate of choice for PAH mixtures since higher potency PAHs have recently been identified which could potentially contribute more and variably to the overall carcinogenicity. Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DBA) and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P) are estimated to have carcinogenic potencies 10 or more times greater than B[a]P but data on their presence and formation in the environment are limited. Several occupational and environmental PAH biomonitoring studies are reviewed here, with particular focus on the specific exposure groups, study design, sample tissue, in particular the use of nasal tissues, and biomarkers used in each study. Consideration of these data is then used to propose a novel biomonitoring approach to evaluate exposure, uptake and the role of high potency PAHs in air pollution-related lung cancer. This is based upon an occupational study examining specific DNA adducts for DBA and DB[a,l]P in nasal cells to evaluate the extent to which these high potency PAHs might contribute to the increased risk of developing lung cancer from air pollution.",

Previously, we established an in vitro assay for TPO activity based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into human follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC-238) cells. It is important to determine whether environmental chemicals can disrupt TPO activity because it is an important factor in the TH axis. In this study, we used our assay to examine the changes in TPO activity in response to various chemicals, including benzophenones (BPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Overall, BPs, PAHs, and POPs slightly altered TPO activity at low doses, as compared with the positive controls methimazole (MMI), genistein, and 2,2',4,4'-tetrahydroxy BP. Benzophenone, benzhydrol, 3-methylchloranthracene, pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(e)pyrene, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and heptachlor decreased TPO activity, while 2,4-dihydroxy BP, 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy BP, and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene increased TPO activity. From these data, we can predict the disruption of TPO activity by various chemicals as a sensitive TH end point. TPO activity should be considered when enacting measures to regulate environmental exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals.",

At a concentration of 0.25 ug/mL, the mutation frequencies induced by DB(a,h)A, and 7,14-diMeDB(a,H)A were 1.3, 13.1 and 59.0 6-thioguanine-resistant colonies/10(5) viable V79 cells, respectively. ...",

No CYP1A induction was observed with benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, acenaphthene, benzo[g,h,i]perylene, and fluorene and low induction was found with fluoranthene and phenanthrene. All other PAHs with three and more benzene rings led to a concentration-related induction of CYP1A, with rebound decreases at high concentrations resulting in bell-shaped concentration-activity curves. Fish-related induction equivalency factors (IEFs) were estimated for all PAHs on the basis of EC50 values of their EROD activities and are reported here for the first time. The following order of decreasing IEFs was found: dibenz[a,h]anthracene > dibenzo[a,i]pyrene > benzo[k]fluoranthene > 3-methylcholanthrene > benzo[a]pyrene > benzo[e]pyrene > chrysene > 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene > perylene > benz[a]anthracene > pyrene. In contrast to the EROD activity, the immunodetectable protein content determined by ELISA showed a concentration-dependent increase. The interaction of PAHs in mixtures of up to eight individual compounds was additive based on their EROD activities. In landfill leachates, determined induction equivalents (IEQ) were significantly higher than calculated IEQs based on analytical measurements, which indicates additional unknown inducing compounds present in leachates. This study shows that the PLHC-1 cell in vitro system serves as an integrative bioanalytical tool in the ecotoxicological evaluation of aquatic environmental samples contaminated with CYP1A-inducing compounds.",

Dibenz(a,h)anthracene occurs ubiquitously as a product of incomplete combustion. Dibenz(a,h)anthracene is present as a minor component of the total PAH content in the environment. It has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke, mainstream smoke of marijuana cigarettes, gasoline and diesel engine exhaust, urban air, coal-heating exhaust, used engine oil, coal-tar, charcoal-broiled steaks, edible oils, and waste water. Dibenz(a,h)anthracene occurs in fossil fuels and is released to air from volcanoes and forest fires. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 9.55X10-10 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates dibenz(a,h)anthracene will exist primarily in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. One urban air monitoring study found the ratio of particulate phase to vapor phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene to be approximately 10 to 1. Vapor-phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours. Particulate-phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Dibenz(a,h)anthracene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. The photolysis of dibenz(a,h)anthracene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles has a half-life of 15 hours under sunlight irradiation. If released to soil, dibenz(a,h)anthracene is expected to have no mobility based upon Koc values ranging from 5.7X10+5 to 4.8X10+7. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole. Dibenz(a,h)anthracene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Degradation half-lives of 361 to 940 days determined in several soil studies indicate that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process in soil. Photolysis is expected to occur on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight. If released into water, dibenz(a,h)anthracene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc range. Biodegradation in environmental waters is expected to be a slow process based on observed degradation rates in soil. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 9000 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism. Dibenz(a,h)anthracene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A BCF of 10 was measured in golden ide fish that were exposed over a 3-day period. A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.63 days has been reported for dibenz(a,h)anthracene. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to dibenz(a,h)anthracene may occur through inhalation of particulate matter and dermal contact at workplaces where dibenz(a,h)anthracene is produced as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to dibenz(a,h)anthracene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water and dermal contact with particulate matter resulting from combustion.

Dibenz(a,h)anthracene occurs ubiquitously as a product of incomplete combustion(1). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene is present as a minor component of the total PAH content in the environment(2). It has been identified in mainstream cigarette smoke, mainstream smoke of marijuana cigarettes, gasoline engine exhaust tar, urban air, coal-heating exhaust, used engine oil, coal-tar, charcoal-broiled steaks, edible oils, and waste water(1). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene occurs in automobile and vehicle exhaust gas from both gasoline and diesel engines(3). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene is formed on pyrolysis of the tobacco constituent Stigmasterol (400 mg/kg) at 700 \u00b0C(4). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene has been detected in compost, wood preservative sludge, gasoline (high octane number), exhaust condensate of gasoline engine, airborne coal tar emissions, and in coke oven airborne emissions(5). Fugitive emissions from coke plants release both gaseous and particulate phases of dibenz(a,h)anthracene to air(6). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene has also been found in incense(7) and street dust(8).",

The photolysis of dibenz(a,h)anthracene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 15 hours under sunlight irradiation(10); therefore, photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight may be an important fate process(SRC).[(1) Swann RL et al; Res Rev 85: 23 (1983) (2) Sims RC, Overcash MR; Res Rev 88: 1-68 (1983) (3) Hawthorne SB et al; Environ Toxicol Chem 25: 2901-2911 (2006) (4) Lei YD et al; J Chem Eng Data 47: 801-806 (2002) (5) USEPA; Hassett JJ et al; Sorption Properties of Sediments and Energy-related Pollutants.

Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected(4) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.4X10-7 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 9.55X10-10 mm Hg(5), and water solubility, 0.00249 mg/L(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an estimated BCF of 9000(SRC), from its log Kow of 6.50(8) and a regression-derived equation(9), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). However, dibenz(a,h)anthracene may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(10). A BCF of 10 was measured in golden ide fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus) that were exposed over a 3-day period(11). A measured fish biotransformation half-life of 1.63 days has been reported for dibenz(a,h)anthracene(12). Degradation half-lives of 361 to 940 days determined in several soil studies (13-15) indicate that biodegradation may not be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4).",

One urban air monitoring study found the ratio of particulate phase to vapor phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene to be approximately 10 to 1(3). Vapor-phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 7.7 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 5.0X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(4). Particulate-phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene has been detected in precipitation(5) and in dry atmospheric deposition(6). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(7) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The photolysis of dibenz(a,h)anthracene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 15 hours under sunlight irradiation(8).[(1) Bidleman TF; Environ Sci Technol 22: 361-367 (1988) (2) Lei YD et al; J Chem Eng Data 47: 801-806 (2002) (3) He J, Balasubramanian R; Chemosphere 78: 742-751 (2010) (4) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

The percent microbial mineralization of dibenz(a,h)anthracene by 6 fresh and 6 ripe composted municipal waste in 10 weeks as measured by (14)CO2 formation was 0.1-1.4%  and 0.8-20.8%, respectively; the average was 0.4% and 12.6%, respectively(2). Half-lives of 18 and 21 days were reported for the degradation (method of degradation unknown) of dibenz(a,h)anthracene in soil systems(3). 20% biodegradation of dibenz(a,h)anthracene was observed in a town gas soil-water slurry reactor using a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon-acclimated mixed culture over a period of 5 weeks incubation(4). 30% biodegradation of dibenz(a,h)anthracene was observed after 2 weeks incubation using a mixed aerobic culture in liquid slurry intentionally contaminated with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons extracted from a town gas site(4). After 30 days of aeration and mixing in a batch slurry bioremediation process, inoculated with a mixed culture of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, the slurry-phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentration was reduced from 1,300 ug/kg on day 30 to 1,180 ug/kg on day 60(5). An initial increase in the slurry-phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentration observed during the first 30 days of the experiment was attributed to a solubilizing effect resulting from bacterial inoculation of the pollutant soil wash concentrates(5). The percent biodegradation of dibenz(a,h)anthracene by microbes in settled domestic wastewater in original culture, 1st, 2nd and 3rd subculture was (concentration): 82% (1.10 ppm), 82% (1.18 ppm), 82% (1.14 ppm) and 75% (1.22 ppm), respectively. 7 days were allowed between each measurement and subculture(6). Soil contaminated with dibenz(a,h)anthracene from the former gasworks site showed little biodegradation in a pilot scale bioslurry when normalized with anthracene biodegradation. The fraction of dibenz(a,h)anthracene left in soil after degradation relative to anthracene at 3, 7, 24, 29 days was 102, 95, 104, 93%, respectively(7). Additional field bioremediation efforts were also unsuccessful after one year of treatment followed by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE)(7). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentration of 12 mg/kg remained the same after 1 year of bioremediateion in the field. SFE was not able to remove dibenz(a,h)anthracene from the fast fraction and only reduced the concentration to 10 mg/kg by in the fast/moderate fraction(8).",

In a pilot-scale treatability study, approximately 43% of the dibenz(a,h)anthracene present in contaminated groundwater was biodegraded over a period of 36 days in a publicly owned treatment works employing activated sludge treatment; approximately 33% was adsorbed onto sludge; and approximately 24% was lost with the effluent(2). In Warburg respirometer tests, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, present at a concentration of 500 mg/L, was not significantly biodegraded by activated sludge from three different treatment plants(3). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene reached 7.9% of its theoretical oxygen demand over a period 144 hours using activated sludge from a treatment plant receiving municipal waste(3). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene was toxic to activated sludge obtained from a treatment plant receiving residential wastes only(3). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene reached 0.9% of its theoretical oxygen demand over a period of 144 hours using activated sludge from a treatment plant receiving combined domestic wastewater(3). Following 8 weeks incubation in a percolator, dibenz(a,h)anthracene was not significantly biodegraded by the indigenous microbial population in a soil sample taken from a former wood impregnation plant(4). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene was not biodegraded after 8 weeks incubation in soil from a former tar oil refinery(4); inoculation of the soil with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading mixed culture did not result in any biodegradation of dibenz(a,h)anthracene(4). Mean half-lives of 750 and 361 days were estimated for dibenz(a,h)anthracene in a synthetic mixture of 13 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (10.6 ug/g) and as a single constituent (12.0 ug/g), respectively, in Kidman fine sandy loam soil(5). The biodegradation half-lives of dibenz(a,h)anthracene in Kidman sandy loam soil (pH 7.9, 0.5% organic carbon) and McLaurin sandy loam soil (pH 4.8, 1.1% organic carbon) were observed to be 361 and 420 days, respectively, at initial chemical concentrations of 12 and 14 mg/kg, respectively(6). Half-lives of 820, 750, and 940 days at 10, 20 and 30 \u00b0C, respectively, were estimated for dibenz(a,h)anthracene after 240 days incubation in soil microcosms (unacclimated agricultural sandy loam soil) spiked with 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons containing dibenz(a,h)anthracene at a concentration of 10.56 ug/g soil(7).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 7.7 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(1). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(2). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(3,4) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). One month (Nov) of sunlight exposure in heptane solution in an Erlenmeyer flask led to the recovery of 54% of the original amount of dibenz(a,h)anthracene(5). Half-lives reported for dibenz(a,h)anthracene coated on TLC plates upon various exposures: simulated sunlight, 9.60 hrs, simulated sunlight and 0.2 ppm ozone, 4.80 hrs, and dark reaction with 0.2 ppm ozone, 2.71 hrs(6). Pronounced photodegradation was reported for dibenz(a,h)anthracene adsorbed on silica and alumina with less pronounced changes for dibenz(a,h)anthracene adsorbed on cellulose and acetylated cellulose; experiments show that the photosensitivity of polyaromatic hydrocarbons is strongly dependent upon the nature of the surface upon which the compound is adsorbed(7). The photolysis of dibenz(a,h)anthracene sorbed to the surface of spruce needles, (Picea Abies), follows first-order kinetics with a half-life of 15 hrs under sunlight irradiation(8).[(1) US EPA; Estimation Program Interface (EPI) Suite.

Photolysis degradation products of dibenz(a,h)anthracene include a p-quinone, a dialdehyde, a ketone, and a coumarine/xanthone(2). The photolysis rate constant of dibenz(a,h)anthracene irradiated in acetonitrile was measured as 0.056 per hour which corresponds to a half-life of 12.4 hours(3). A custom ozonation system examining the degradation of dibenz(a,h)anthracene in water exposed to ozone found the initial dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentration of 0.005 mg/L was reduced to 0 after 2-3 minutes of exposure(4).",

However, it may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). A BCF of 10 was measured in golden ide fish (Leuciscus idus melanotus) that were exposed to dibenz(a,h)anthracene (0.05 mg/L) over a 3-day period(5).

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Seawater samples from the Baltic Sea collected in Nov 1993 at depths of 10 to 15 m were found to contain dibenz(a,h)anthracene at concentrations ranging from 2.20 to 16.93 pg/L, average concentration of 6.79 pg/L; concentrations in samples at depths below 70 m ranged from 1.39 to 173.41 pg/L, average concentration of 28.38 pg/L(2). The water of a semi-rural lake, Esthwaite Water, Cumbria, UK contained an average concentration of 0.2 ng/cu m dibenz(a,h)anthracene during a 1 year monitoring study(3). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene was detected in water from the Huaihe River, in the Jiangsu Section of China. Various locations along the river measured concentrations ranging from 0.05-0.33 ug/L(4). In Australia, waters originating from the Brisbane River and Moretown Bay in 2001-2002 were found to contain dibenz(a,h)anthracene by collection via semi-permeable membrane devices(SPMD)(5); the dibenz(a,h)anthracene was quantified by GC-MS and found to range from 0.3-100 pg/L from several sites along the waterways(5). Water samples collected from eight sites during September-November 2003 sampling from the Menderes River in Denizli, Turkey detected dibenz(a,h)anthracene at levels ranging from not detected (0.78 ng/L detection limit) to 5.3 ug/L(6). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene was one of 17 PAHs detected in the Soan River Pakistan at total PAH concentrations ranging from 61 to 2-7 ng/L(7).",

The mean concentration of dibenz(a,h)anthracene in ditch water in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia was 0.26 ug/L from farmlands; 4.1 ug/L from railway ditches with utility poles; and 0.10 ug/L in railway ditches without utility poles(2). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene was detected in utility right-of-way ditch water at mean concentrations of 0.10 ug/L 4 m upstream from a utility pole; 0.9 ug/L adjacent to a pole; and 0.45 ug/L 4 m downstream from a utility pole(2). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene was detected in sewage sludge samples from waste water treatment works of three major cities and one rural site in Switzerland at a mean concentration of 107.8 ug/kg dry weight(3). Dibenz(a,h)anthracene occurs in exhaust tar isolated from first run gasoline engine exhaust at a concentration of 2.5 mg/kg and automobile exhaust gas after a 1-minute run at 0.16 mg/kg(4). Traffic in Birmingham, UK was shown to be the origin of dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentration in urban atmosphere(4). In 1996, a study monitored dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentrations during rush hour traffic by GC-MS. Samples were collected over 2 hour periods to illustrate traffic related temporal variation It was found that the mean concentrations in ug/cu m for various time periods were 6-8 PM(0.09), 8-10 PM(0.17), 10-12 PM(0.09), 12-14 AM(0.09), 14-16 AM(0.09), 16-18AM(0.14), 18-20AM (0.21)(5). Incense burning has shown to emit particulate phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene(6); Central American smudge bundle incense had a dibenz(a,h)anthracene emission rate of 15.5 ng/min, North American powder incense 8.25 ng/min, and North American rock incense 362 ng/min(6). Based on dynamometric testing of eight European diesel cars and light-duty vehicles, the dibenz(a,h)anthracene emission factor in exhaust was determined to range from <0.03 to 0.13 ug/km(7); emission factor from gasoline cars was <0.03 to 0.23 ug/km(7).",

Batch-type medical waste incinerators have been operated at medical centers have shown to emit PAH's including dibenz(a,h)anthracene(2). In Taiwan, mechanical grate medical waste incinerators (MG-MWI) emitted 1.54 ug/cu m of dibenz(a,h)anthracene and fixed grate medical waste incinerators(FG-MWI 1.99 ug/cu m air pollution control devices were installed such as an electrostatic precipitator and wet scrubber(2). When no controls were in place the emission concentrations were 2.26 ug/cu m (MG-MWI) and 5.49 ug/cu m(FG-MWI)(2). The release of dibenz(a,h)anthracene from cooking sources into the ambient atmosphere was reported in southern Taiwan(3); mean concentrations of particulate and gaseous phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene originating from various types of restaurants were measured, and restaurants cooking Chinese food emitted 1.91 ug/cu m, Western 1.35 ug/cu m, fast food 0.069 ug/cu m, and none for Japanese food(3). Analysis of fugitive emissions from four coke plants in China detected dibenz(a,h)anthracene in both gaseous and particulate phases with mean levels ranging from 0.05-1.60 ug/cu m(4).",

The average dibenz(a,h)anthracene ambient air concentration along Exhibition Road, UK between Jan 1991 and July 1992 was 0.13 ng/cu m(8). Airborne particulate samples collected from the Upper Silesia region of Poland, in the winter of 1988-89 and the summer of 1989, were found to contain dibenz(a,h)anthracene (number of times detected, concentration range in ng/cu m): winter (4, 2.1 to 14.9) and summer (9, 1.0 to 23.6)(9). Ambient air samples collected throughout Singapore from July to Dec 1983 contained dibenz(a,h)anthracene at concentrations ranging from 3.4 to 8.4 ug/1000 cu m(10). The yearly mean particulate-phase dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentrations obtained at urban sites in Lahore, Pakistan and Birmingham, UK were 3.85 and 0.43 ng/cu m, respectively(11). In Ionia and Sindos, Greece atmospheric particulate concentrations ranged from 0.12-15 ng/cu m and 0.14-35 ng/cu m respectively in 1993-1994(12). Winter and summer air monitoring at two sites in Hong Kong between 1998-2005 detected dibenz(a,h)anthracene at average winter and summer concentrations of 0.78-1.08 and 0.14-0.24 ng/cu m respectively(13). Median dibenz(a,h)anthracene concentrations of 0.26 and 0.03 ng/cu m were detected, respectively, in particulate-phase and gas-phase air samples collected in Singapore in June 2007 and may 2008(14).

This is particularly challenging because many c-PAHs share sources and occur as a complex mixture. Accurate and precise apportionment of personal exposure according to exposure venues could aid in the understanding of human health effects due to a given source. Here, we partitioned indoor and personal exposure concentrations to seven c-PAHs and pyrene according to the indoor- and outdoor-origins. METHODS: A simultaneous, integrated monitoring of personal, indoor and outdoor concentrations of nine PAHs was conducted in 75 homes for a consecutive 48-hour period across a two-year period in Krakow, Poland. Due to few known indoor sources for chrysene, we used this PAH species as a tracer for infiltration of outdoor PAHs. Personal and indoor concentrations of seven c-PAHs and pyrene were apportioned to home indoor, non-home indoor and outdoor origins. RESULTS: Using Chrysene-in/Chrysene-out as proxy for an infiltration factor, Finf, infiltrated PAHs of outdoor origin are overall higher in concentration than those emitted from the indoor origin. Average contribution by the outdoor sources on B[a]A, B[b]F, and B[k]F were 92%, 79%, and 78% across all seasons, respectively. In contrast, in homes where a household member smoked, average contributions by the outdoor sources on B[ghi]P, B[a]P, D[ah]A, and IP were lower (i.e., 67%, 65%, 67%, and 66%, respectively). Season-averaged contributions by the outdoor sources on personal exposure to B[a]A, B[b]F, and B[k]F were 92%, 74%, and 77%, respectively. On the other hand, season-averaged home indoor source contributions on personal exposure to B[a]A, B[b]F, and B[k]F were estimated at 6%, 15%, and 19%, respectively. Similar contributions by season-averaged home indoor sources on personal exposure were estimated at 28% for B[ghi]P, 31% for B[a]P, 25% for D[ah]A, and 28% for IP. CONCLUSION: Of the seven c-PAHs, B[a]A, B[b]F, and B[k]F are enriched in indoor and personal exposure concentrations from the outdoor coal-combustion. B[ghi]P, B[a]P, D[a,h]A, and IP, PAHs with some of the highest carcinogenic and mutagenic potencies, are considerably enriched by cigarette smoke in addition to the outdoor sources.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.

An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Preparative hazard, nitric acid and glyoxal to produce glyoxylic acid has had explosive consequences. Carboxylic acids donate hydrogen ions if a base is present to accept them. They react in this way with all bases, both organic (for example, the amines) and inorganic. Their reactions with bases, called \"neutralizations\", are accompanied by the evolution of substantial amounts of heat. Neutralization between an acid and a base produces water plus a salt. Carboxylic acids with six or fewer carbon atoms are freely or moderately soluble in water; those with more than six carbons are slightly soluble in water. Soluble carboxylic acid dissociate to an extent in water to yield hydrogen ions. The pH of solutions of carboxylic acids is therefore less than 7.0. Many insoluble carboxylic acids react rapidly with aqueous solutions containing a chemical base and dissolve as the neutralization generates a soluble salt. Carboxylic acids in aqueous solution and liquid or molten carboxylic acids can react with active metals to form gaseous hydrogen and a metal salt. Such reactions occur in principle for solid carboxylic acids as well, but are slow if the solid acid remains dry. Even \"insoluble\" carboxylic acids may absorb enough water from the air and dissolve sufficiently in it to corrode or dissolve iron, steel, and aluminum parts and containers. Carboxylic acids, like other acids, react with cyanide salts to generate gaseous hydrogen cyanide. The reaction is slower for dry, solid carboxylic acids. Insoluble carboxylic acids react with solutions of cyanides to cause the release of gaseous hydrogen cyanide. Flammable and/or toxic gases and heat are generated by the reaction of carboxylic acids with diazo compounds, dithiocarbamates, isocyanates, mercaptans, nitrides, and sulfides. Carboxylic acids, especially in aqueous solution, also react with sulfites, nitrites, thiosulfates (to give H2S and SO3), dithionites (SO2), to generate flammable and/or toxic gases and heat. Their reaction with carbonates and bicarbonates generates a harmless gas (carbon dioxide) but still heat. Like other organic compounds, carboxylic acids can be oxidized by strong oxidizing agents and reduced by strong reducing agents. These reactions generate heat. A wide variety of products is possible. Like other acids, carboxylic acids may initiate polymerization reactions; like other acids, they often catalyze (increase the rate of) chemical reactions.",

However, when glyoxylate, a keto acid precursor to glycine, was administered with benzoate 1 hr prior to a challenge of ammonia, protection against ammonia toxicity was less successful than with benzoate alone. At the cellular and subcellular levels, glyoxylate and benzoate each inhibited the urea cycle in isolated hepatocytes and pyruvate carboxylase in isolated mitochondria. The action of each drug was associated with depletion of aspartate content in isolated hepatocytes and reduction of pyruvate-dependent incorporation of carbon dioxide into aspartate in assays with isolated mitochondria. Depression of aspartate regeneration by inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase is a likely mechanism for impairment of urea cycle activity by both drugs. In whole animals, inhibition of pyruvate carboxylase may contribute to benzoate toxicity and the adverse influence of glyoxylate on benzoate therapy.",

In animals given single large doses of ethylene glycol (9 to 12 g/kg), striking oxalate formation was present in renal tubules. Crystals appeared throughout the proximal and distal convoluted tubules and were less numerous in the collecting tubules. In only one rat, oxalate crystals were present in the brain, as has also been reported in human poisoning. Oxalate crystals were also present in renal tubules of animals receiving glycol aldehyde, glycolic acid, and glyoxylic acid, although the renal oxalosis was less extensive with glycolaldehyde. The three proposed metabolites were all more toxic on an acute basis than was ethylene glycol since a number of animals died within eight hours of receiving 5 to 6 g/kg of body weight of the metabolites. Renal tubular pathology was not always accompanied by crystal formation, and the author concludes that cytotoxicity, rather than simple mechanical obstruction, is largely responsible for renal failure.",

Glyoxylic acid occurs as a natural constituent of plants (such as unripe fruit and young green leaves) and is a metabolite in mammalian biochemical pathways. If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates glyoxylic acid will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase glyoxylic acid will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 29 hours. Vapor-phase glyoxylic acid degrades rapidly by direct photolysis (daytime persistence is not expected to exceed a few hours). If released to soil, glyoxylic acid is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 1. The pKa of glyoxylic acid is 3.3, indicating this compound will exist primarily as an anion in moist soil surfaces and anions are expected to have very high mobility in soils. Volatilization of glyoxylic acid from moist soil or water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process since the anion will not volatilize and the neutral species has an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C. Glyoxylic acid may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. If released into water, glyoxylic acid is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon its estimated Koc. If released to soil or water, glyoxylic acid is expected to biodegrade. Degradation may also occur in sunlit water through direct photolysis. An estimated BCF of 3 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to glyoxylic acid may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where glyoxylic acid is produced or used. Since glyoxylic acid is used in cosmetic preparation, the general population may be exposed to this compound through the use of these products. (SRC)",

The pKa of glyoxylic acid is 3.3(3), which indicates that this compound will exist primarily as an anion in water(SRC). Volatilization of glyoxylic acid from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process(SRC) since the anion will not volatilize and the neutral species has an estimated Henry's Law constant of 3X10-9 atm-cu m/mole at 25 \u00b0C(SRC), using a fragment constant estimation method(4). According to a classification scheme(5), an estimated BCF of 3(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of -1.4(SRC) and a regression-derived equation(6), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Direct photolysis in sunlit surface waters may also be an important fate pathway since glyoxylic acid undergoes rapid direct photolysis in ambient air(7). By analogy to other aliphatic acids(8-10), biodegradation is expected to be an important degradation process for glyoxylic acid in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

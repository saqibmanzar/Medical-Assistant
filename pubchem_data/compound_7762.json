PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

It is calculated as the sum of the mass of each constituent atom multiplied by the number of atoms of that element in the molecular formula.  The molecular weight is also called the relative molar mass, because molecular weights are reported in daltons, which is defined relative to the mass of the isotope 12C (carbon 12).",

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

We exploited the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a model in which inositol de novo synthesis has been extensively characterized, to test the effects of ethyl butyrate (EB), 2-ethyl-butyric acid, sodium butyrate, and n-propyl hexanoate on inositol biosynthesis. Cell growth was followed by measuring the optical density of the cultures (spectrophotometrically), RNA abundance was determined by Northern blot analysis, intracellular inositol was measured by a fluorometric assay, and 1-d-myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase activity was examined using a chromatographic method. Of the tested compounds, only EB exhibited an inositol-depleting effect. The inositol-depleting effect of EB was achieved without significant adverse effect on cell growth, pointing to lesser toxicity compared to valproate. These results indicate that EB is a potential candidate for mood-stabilizing therapy.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

It is used in manufacturing artificial rum; perfumery; the alcoholic solution constitutes the so-called \"pineapple oil\". It is also used in flavoring extracts, solvent mixture for cellulose esters and ethers. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Tested at 5% in petrolatum, ethyl butyrate produced no irritation after a 48 hr closed-patch test in 25 human subjects. ANIMAL STUDIES: Ethyl butyrate applied full strength to intact or abraded rabbit skin for 24 hr under occlusion was moderately irritating. In rabbits admin of 2.14 mL/kg caused increase in respiratory volume. In vitro it has been shown to have a hemolytic effect slightly greater than that of methyl butyrate.",

Ethyl n-butyrate occurs naturally in some plants and is produced from garden and household waste. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 14.0 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates ethyl n-butyrate will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase ethyl n-butyrate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3 days. Ethyl n-butyrate does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, ethyl n-butyrate is expected to have very high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 20. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. Ethyl n-butyrate has been classified as readily biodegradable as estimated by results from analogous compounds in the Japanese MITI test, suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in soil and water. If released into water, ethyl n-butyrate is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hrs and 5 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 8 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process with base-catalyzed second-order hydrolysis half-lives of 3.5 years and 130 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively. Occupational exposure to ethyl n-butyrate may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where ethyl n-butyrate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to n-ethyl butyrate via ingestion of food and dermal contact with consumer products containing ethyl n-butyrate.(SRC)",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 4.4X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), derived from its vapor pressure, 14.0 mm Hg(4), and water solubility, 4,900 mg/L(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hrs and 5 days, respectively(SRC). According to a classification scheme(6), an estimated BCF of 8(SRC), from an estimated log Kow of 1.85(2) and a regression-derived equation(2), suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low(SRC). Ethyl n-butyrate has been classified as readily biodegradable as estimated by results from analogous compounds in the Japanese MITI test(7), suggesting that biodegradation may be an important environmental fate process in water(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem generates 3D conformers for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: [1] not too large (with <= 50 non-hydrogen atoms), [2] not too flexible (with <= 15 rotatable bonds), [3] consisting of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I), [4] having only a single covalent unit (i.e., not a salt or a mixture), [5] contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field used for conformer generation, and [6] has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereo centers.  Compounds that do not satisfy any of these conditions are not considered for 3-D conformer generation.  In some rare cases, a compound satisfies all conditions but the conformer generation for the compound fails for some reason. More detailed information on 3D conformer generation can be found in Kim et al., J. Cheminform. 2013, 5, 1.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Following exposure and absorption, DnOP is metabolized to its hydrolytic monoester, mono-n-octyl phthalate (MnOP), and other oxidative products. The urinary levels of one of these oxidative metabolites, mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), were about 560-fold higher than MnOP in Sprague-Dawley rats dosed with DnOP by gavage. Furthermore, MCPP was also found in the urine of rats dosed with di-isooctyl phthalate (DiOP), di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP), di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), although at concentrations considerably lower than in rats given similar concentrations of DnOP. The comparatively much higher urinary concentrations of MCPP than of the hydrolytic monoesters of the high-molecular-weight phthalates DiOP, DiNP, and DiDP in the exposed rats suggest that these monoesters may be poor biomarkers of exposure to their precursor phthalates and may explain the relatively low frequency of detection of these monoester metabolites in human populations. MCPP and MnOP were also measured in 267 human urine samples. The frequent detection and higher urinary concentrations of MCPP than MnOP suggest that exposure to DnOP might be higher than previously thought based on the measurements of MnOP alone. However, because MCPP is also a minor metabolite of DBP and other phthalates in rats, and the metabolism of phthalates in rodents and humans may differ, additional data on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of MCPP are needed to completely understand the extent of human exposure to DnOP from the urinary concentrations of MCPP.",

The urinary levels of one of these oxidative metabolites, mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), were about 560-fold higher than MnOP in Sprague-Dawley rats dosed with DnOP by gavage. Furthermore, MCPP was also found in the urine of rats dosed with di-isooctyl phthalate (DiOP), di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP), di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), although at concentrations considerably lower than in rats given similar concentrations of DnOP. The comparatively much higher urinary concentrations of MCPP than of the hydrolytic monoesters of the high-molecular-weight phthalates DiOP, DiNP, and DiDP in the exposed rats suggest that these monoesters may be poor biomarkers of exposure to their precursor phthalates and may explain the relatively low frequency of detection of these monoester metabolites in human populations. MCPP and MnOP were also measured in 267 human urine samples. The frequent detection and higher urinary concentrations of MCPP than MnOP suggest that exposure to DnOP might be higher than previously thought based on the measurements of MnOP alone. However, because MCPP is also a minor metabolite of DBP and other phthalates in rats, and the metabolism of phthalates in rodents and humans may differ, additional data on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of MCPP are needed to completely understand the extent of human exposure to DnOP from the urinary concentrations of MCPP.",

The toxicokinetics of DnOP in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats /was investigated/ by monitoring the excretion of DnOP metabolites in urine after oral administration of DnOP (300 mg/kg). By using authentic standards, the presence of urinary phthalic acid (PA), MnOP, and the major DnOP metabolite, mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) was clearly established. Furthermore, ... five additional urinary DnOP oxidative metabolites /were identified/ based on their chromatographic behavior and mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern. These DnOP oxidative metabolites, are postulated to be mono-carboxymethyl phthalate (MCMP), mono-(5-carboxy-n-pentyl) phthalate (MCPeP), mono-(7-carboxy-n-heptyl) phthalate (MCHpP), and isomers of mono-hydroxy-n-octyl phthalate (MHOP) (e.g., mono-(7-hydroxy-n-octyl) phthalate) and of mono-oxo-n-octyl phthalate (MOOP) (e.g., mono-(7-oxo-n-octyl) phthalate). The urinary excretion of DnOP metabolites followed a biphasic excretion pattern. The metabolite levels decreased significantly after the first day of DnOP administration although MCPP, MCHpP, MHOP, and MOOP were detectable after 4 days. We also studied the in vitro metabolism of DnOP and MnOP by rat liver microsomes. DnOP produced MnOP, MHOP, and PA in vitro whereas, MnOP produced MHOP and PA in vitro at detectable levels.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

It is used as a plasticizer; DNOP can represent 5-60% of the total weight of the plastics and resins. It is found in cosmetics and colorants. DNOP also serves as a carrier for catalysts or initiators and as a substitute for electrical capacitor fluid. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: In 173 subjects with suspected dermatoses to plastic or glue allergens, two subjects (1.2% of the group) experienced irritation after patch testing with 2.0% DNOP. None of the patients had allergic reactions. There is a case study of a worker with continuous exposure to DNOP during the manufacture of imitation leather, who developed an asthmatic reaction to the substance. Women with endometriosis showed significantly higher concentrations of DNOP in their blood in a study of 49 infertile women with endometriosis (study group), and 38 age-matched women without endometriosis (control group I) but with infertility related to tubal defects, fibroids, polycystic ovaries, idiopathic infertility and pelvic inflammatory diseases diagnosed by laparoscopy and a further group of 21 age-matched women (control group II). An increase in toxic polyneuritis has been reported in workers exposed primarily to dibutyl phthalates. Lesser levels of exposure to dioctyl, diisooctyl, benzylbutyl phthalates, and tricresyl phosphate were also noted. ANIMAL STUDIES: DNOP was reported to be a slight skin irritant when applied to the depilated skin of guinea pigs. However, DNOP was not a skin sensitizer in guinea pigs. Ocular administration of DNOP resulted in slight conjunctival irritation and no corneal damage. The results of several acute- and intermediate-duration oral studies in rodents indicate that the potential of DNOP to cause adverse reproductive and developmental effects is low. Unlike other phthalate esters such as DEHP, DNOP does not appear to affect testicular function or morphology. Observed hepatic effects in intermediate duration studies consisted of a statistically significant increase in hepatic ethoxyresorufin-0-deethylase activity and histological changes in hepatic architecture. Thyroid toxicity was also noted at this concentration. Rats treated with 100, 300, or 600 mg/kg DNOP by ip injection for up to 90 day were evaluated for immunological responses. The high dose resulted in early loss of distinction between the cortex and medulla of the thyroid, reduced numbers of follicles in the lymph nodes, and loss of morphology in the adrenal glands. However, there was no effect on immune response. Results of studies in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 (with and without S-9 metabolic activation systems) indicated that DNOP is not mutagenic. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The toxicity of DNOP was assessed by measuring the effect of exposure to these compounds on the fecundity of Daphnia magna and on the hatching and survival of the early life stages of the fathead minnow Pimephales promelas. For Daphnia magna, exposure to 1.0 mg/L DNOP caused a significant reduction in reproduction. Exposure to DNOP did not affect survival of either early embryos or larvae of the fathead minnow at doses up to 10 mg/L (the highest dose tested). Hatching of the embryos was significantly decreased at 10 mg/L, but not at 3.2 mg/L DNOP.",

Di-n-octyl-phthalate (DOP) was added to 1%. The development of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase positive (GGT+) foci was strongly induced by di-n-octyl-phthalate in the livers of rats that had received a subcarcinogenic dose of diethylnitrosamine. None of the other compounds showed any tumor promoting activity. The development of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase positive preneoplastic foci in livers of rats was neither enhanced nor suppressed when rats were fed a dose equimolar to 0.5% di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. An elevated carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) level was found following treatment with mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate or di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. Mono(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate significantly decreased liver gamma-glutamyl-transpeptiase activity. In addition mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate lowered the mean number of foci/square centimeter below that of the 2-ethylhexanol treated group. /It was found/ that di-n-octyl-phthalate can act as a tumor promoter, and this activity seems to be unrelated to liver peroxisome proliferation (as measure by carnitine acetyltransferase).",

Following exposure and absorption, DnOP is metabolized to its hydrolytic monoester, mono-n-octyl phthalate (MnOP), and other oxidative products. The urinary levels of one of these oxidative metabolites, mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), were about 560-fold higher than MnOP in Sprague-Dawley rats dosed with DnOP by gavage. Furthermore, MCPP was also found in the urine of rats dosed with di-isooctyl phthalate (DiOP), di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP), di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), although at concentrations considerably lower than in rats given similar concentrations of DnOP. The comparatively much higher urinary concentrations of MCPP than of the hydrolytic monoesters of the high-molecular-weight phthalates DiOP, DiNP, and DiDP in the exposed rats suggest that these monoesters may be poor biomarkers of exposure to their precursor phthalates and may explain the relatively low frequency of detection of these monoester metabolites in human populations. MCPP and MnOP were also measured in 267 human urine samples. The frequent detection and higher urinary concentrations of MCPP than MnOP suggest that exposure to DnOP might be higher than previously thought based on the measurements of MnOP alone. However, because MCPP is also a minor metabolite of DBP and other phthalates in rats, and the metabolism of phthalates in rodents and humans may differ, additional data on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of MCPP are needed to completely understand the extent of human exposure to DnOP from the urinary concentrations of MCPP.",

Groups of male F344 rats were fed diets with di(isononyl) phthalate branched (DINP-1) at concentrations of 0, 1000, or 12,000 ppm and male B6C3F1 mice at 0, 500, or 6000 ppm DINP-1. After 2 or 4 weeks of treatment, changes in liver weight, gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), peroxisomal beta-oxidation (PBOX), and replicative DNA synthesis were examined. In addition, hepatic and serum concentrations of the parent compound and major metabolites were determined. Relative to controls in both species, increased liver weight and PBOX at the high dose of DINP-1 were consistent with peroxisomal proliferation. Hepatic GJIC was inhibited and DNA synthesis was increased at the high dose of DINP-1, which is also consistent with the tumorigenic response in rats and mice reported in other chronic studies at these doses. These hepatic effects were not observed at the low doses of DINP-1. At comparable low doses of DINP-1 in other chronic studies, no liver tumors were observed in rats and mice. The monoester metabolite (MINP-1) was detected in the liver at greater concentrations in mice than rats. This result is also consistent with the dose-response observations in rat and mouse chronic studies. Additionally, other structurally similar dialkyl phthalate esters ranging from C7 to C11 were evaluated using a similar protocol for comparison to DINP-1; these included an alternative isomeric form of DINP (DINP-A), di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP), di-isoheptyl phthalate (DIHP), di-heptyl, nonyl undecyl phthalate (D711P), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP). Collectively, these data indicate that in rats and mice, DINP-1 and other C7-C11 phthalates exhibit a threshold for inducing hepatic cellular events. Further, where previous chronic data were available for these compounds, these phthalates elicited hepatic effects at doses that correlated with the tumorigenic response. Overall, these studies suggest a good correlation between the inhibition of GJIC when compared with the data on production of liver tumors in chronic studies.",

Body weights, food & water consumptions, & clinical signs in a dose-range-finding study were used to set doses for the main study of 0.0, 1.25%, 2.5%, & 5% in feed. Feed consumption was unchanged by DOP addition. Based on measured consumption, these concns of DOP produced calculated consumption estimates of nearly equal to 1.8, 3.6, & 7.5 g DOP/kg bw/day. Three controls & two middle dose mice died during the continuous breeding phase. Both treated & contol mice gained an average of 12-14% of their original body weight. There was no effect of DOP exposure on the number of litters/pair, the mean number of live pups/litter (control value: 11.5 +/- 0.4 pups), proportion born alive, live pup weight adjusted for litter size (control: 1.60 +/- 0.01 gr) or days to deliver each litter. In the absence of any demonstrable reproductive toxicity, a Task 3 crossover mating was not performed, & the fertility of the second generation was evaluated for the controls & high dose groups. In the F1 mice, growth & viability were unaffected by DOP consumption. Reproduction was also unaffected: the same proportion of treated & control mice mated, & bore live litters. The size & viability of these litters was also unaffected by DOP (11.5 pups/litter, controls), as was adjusted pup weight (1.50 +/- 0.03 gr). The F1 adults were killed & necropsied after the F2 litters were delivered & evaluated. In F1 females, body weight was unaffected by 5% DOP exposure, but when adjusted for body weight, both liver weight & kidney weight was increased by 22% & 10%, respectively. Treated male terminal body weight was also unchanged by DOP, while adjusted liver weight was increased by 28%, & seminal vesicle weight was decreased by 12%. Epididymal sperm concn & motility were unchanged by DOP exposure at 5%; the proportion of morphologically abnormal forms was reduced in the treated mice, from a control value of 5% abnormal to 3.5% abnormal in the DOP-exposed males. Estrous cycle length & stage distribution (the proportion of time spent in each estrous stage) was unchanged by DOP exposure. The single finding of a slight reduction in F1 seminal vesicle weight is interesting in light of current concerns about second-generational reproductive toxicity, but needs confirmation. Overall, these data show that, at doses that induced significant hepatomegaly, di-n-octyl-phthalate was without any adverse reproductive effect in Swiss mice.",

For Daphnia magna, exposure to 1.8 mg/L di-n-butyl phthalate or 1.0 mg/L di-n-octyl phthalate caused a significant reduction in reproduction. Doses of 0.56 mg/L di-n-butyl phthalate or 0.32 mg/L di-n-octyl phthalate had no significant effect in decreasing reproduction. Survival of fathead minnow embryos was decreased by exposure to 1.8 mg/L di-n-butyl phthalate; none of the embryos exposed to this dose hatched successfully. Hatching and larval survival were affected by exposure to 1.0 mg/L di-n-butyl phthalate but not to 0.56 mg/L. Exposure to di-n-octyl phthalate did not affect survival of either early embryos or larvae of the fathead minnow at doses up to 10 mg/L (the highest dose tested). Hatching of the embryos was significantly decreased at 10 mg/L, but not at 3.2 mg/L di-n-octyl phthalate.",

The effect of di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) on fatty acid composition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in Tetrahymena pyriformis /(freshwater protozoan)/ NT-1 /was examined/. When Tetrahymena cells were grown in di-n-octyl phthalate containing proteose peptone medium, the cell growth was repressed. This repression was attended by decreases in the phosphatidylcholine content of the cells and decreases in oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2) and linolenic (18:3) acids of phosphatidylcholine and an increase in palmitoleic acid (16:1). The ratio of oleic/stearic acid (18:0) of phosphatidylcholine in cells grown in di-n-octyl phthalate containing medium was lower than that of control cells, while the ratio of palmitoleic/palmitic acid (16:0) was higher than that of control. On the other hand, no changes in the ratios of linoleic/oleic and linolenic/linoleic acids/ were observed. The activity of microsomal stearoyl-CoA desaturase from cells grown with di-n-octyl phthalate (0.63 umol/mL medium) decreased to 27% of that from control cells, while the microsomal palmitoyl-CoA desaturase activity increased to 210% of the control value. By the addition of dioleoyl glyceride to the di-n-octyl phthalate containing medium, the effects of di-n-octyl phthalate on Tetrahymena cells were completely blocked.",

The 14 esters were dimethyl phthalate; diethyl phthalate; di-n-butyl phthalate; butyl benzyl phthalate; dihexyl phthalate; butyl 2-ethylhexyl phthalate; di-(n-hexyl, n-octyl, n-decyl) phthalate; di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate; diisooctyl phthalate; diisononyl phthalate; di-(heptyl, nonyl, undecyl) phthalate; diisodecyl phthalate; diundecyl phthalate; and ditridecyl phthalate. Phthalate esters with alkyl chain lengths of four carbon atoms or fewer were determined to be acutely toxic at concentrations ranging from 0.21 to 377 mg/L depending on the ester and the solubility of the test chemical in water. There was a general trend for the lower-molecular-weight phthalate esters (C1 to C4 alkyl chain lengths: dimethyl phthalate; diethyl phthalate; di-n-butyl phthalate; and butyl benzyl phthalate) to become more toxic with decreasing water solubility for all species tested. There were only minor differences in species sensitivity to each of the phthalate esters. Phthalate esters with alkyl chain lengths of six carbon atoms or more were not acutely toxic at concentrations approaching their respective aqueous solubilities. Insufficient mortality occurred to calculate either LC50 or EC50 values or acute no-observed-effect concentrations for these higher-molecular-weight phthalate esters. The lack of toxicity observed for the higher-molecular-weight phthalate esters resulted from their limited water solubility (< or=1.1 mg/L).",

For the lower-molecular-weight phthalate esters-dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP)-the results of the studies indicated a general trend in which toxicity for both species increased as water solubility decreased. The geometric mean maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (GM-MATC) for D. magna ranged from 0.63 to 34.8 mg/L. For the higher-molecular-weight phthalate esters-dihexyl phthalate (DHP), butyl 2-ethylhexyl phthalate (BOP), di-(n-hexyl, n-octyl, n-decyl) phthalate (610P), di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisooctyl phthalate (DIOP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), di-(heptyl, nonyl, undecyl) phthalate (711P), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), diundecyl phthalate (DUP), and ditridecyl phthalate (DTDP)-the GM-MATC values ranged from 0.042 to 0.15 mg/L. Survival was equally sensitive and sometimes more sensitive than reproduction. The observed toxicity to daphnids with most of the higher-molecular-weight phthalate esters appeared to be due to surface entrapment or a mode of toxicity that is not due to exposure to dissolved aqueous-phase chemical. Early life-stage toxicity studies with rainbow trout indicated that survival (DMP) and growth (DBP) were affected at 24 and 0.19 mg/L, respectively. This pattern of observed toxicity with the lower-molecular-weight phthalate esters and not the higher-molecular-weight phthalate esters is consistent with previously reported acute toxicity studies for several aquatic species.",

The only noted lethal threshold is at a DnBP concentration of 0.5 mg/L for rainbow trout (Salmo gairderi). The data on the lethality of dimethylphthalate (DMP), diethylphthalate (DEP), and di-n-propylphthalate (DnPP) seem generally to fall within the same range as that for DnBP. In contrast, the values for DEHP lethal concentrations (LC50) are at least an order of magnitude higher than those for DnBP. The data for di-n-octylphthalate (DnOP) suggest that it is even less toxic than DEHP. Studies on the mortality of aquatic organisms exposed chronically to phthalate esters ... indicate that no threshold /for DnBP/ exists. Several effects of phthalate esters have been reported to occur at what may be considered an acutely lethal range of concentrations. Such effects cannot be truly classified as sublethal but are most probably manifestations of toxicity prior to actual death. Hence, effects such as suppression of respiration, failure of reproduction and survival of young, growth impairment, and depression of heartbeat, although usually considered as sublethal effects, were noted in experiments using acutely lethal concentrations of phthalate esters.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 1.0X10-7 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates di-n-octyl phthalate will exist in both the vapor and particulate phases in the atmosphere. Vapor-phase di-n-octyl phthalate will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals; the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hours. Particulate-phase di-n-octyl phthalate will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Di-n-octyl phthalate contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, di-n-octyl phthalate is expected to have no mobility based upon reported log Koc values of 4.38-6.3. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.6X10-6 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Di-n-octyl phthalate is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 67% of the theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is an important environmental fate process. If released into water, di-n-octyl phthalate is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the reported Koc values. Di-n-octyl phthalate was biodegraded 85% after 10 days incubation in Rhine river water at 20 \u00b0C; at 4 \u00b0C, biodegradation was negligible. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 31 and 230 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. Volatilization of di-n-octyl phthalate from model waste stabilization ponds was not observed.  BCF values of 1.16-9400 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high, this range may indicate the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds. Hydrolysis half-lives of 7.7 years and 280 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, were estimated. Occupational exposure to di-n-octyl phthalate may occur through inhalation of aerosols and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where di-n-octyl phthalate is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to di-n-octyl phthalate via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with products containing di-n-octyl phthalate.

Di-n-octyl phthalate is found in flooring and carpet tile, canvas tarps, swimming pool liners, notebook covers, traffic cones, vinyl gloves, garden hoses, weather stripping, flea collars and shoes. Because phthalates are not chemically bound to plastics, di-n-octyl phthalate can be released during the use or disposal of the product. Phthalates released to the environment can be deposited on or taken up by crops intended for human or livestock consumption, and, therefore, can enter the human food supply(1).",

Di-n-octyl phthalate, present at 100 mg/L, reached 67% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(5). In a model terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem, di-n-octyl phthalate was rapidly degraded by organisms in the system, having a half-life of 5 days(6). Respirometric measurements of soil amended with di-n-octyl phthalate shows that when acclimated, there is some microbial utilization, although this is marginal at 4 and 10 \u00b0C(7).",

Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 31 and 230 days, respectively(SRC). Hydrolysis half-lives of 7.7 years and 280 days at pH values of 7 and 8, respectively, were estimated(6).

Volatilization of di-n-octyl phthalate from model waste stabilization ponds was not observed(7). According to a classification scheme(8), BCFs of 1.16-9400 in mosquito fish(9), suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high(SRC), this range may indicate the ability of aquatic organisms to readily metabolize this class of compounds(3).

Vapor-phase di-n-octyl phthalate is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 19 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 2.1X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(3). Particulate-phase di-n-octyl phthalate may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Di-n-octyl phthalate has a strong UV absorption band at 274.5 nm which extends beyond 290 nm(4) and, therefore, may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Di-n-octyl phthalate was degraded 92-94% in 7 days in a static degradation test utilizing a sewage seed that had been subcultured three times(2). In a model terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem, di-n-octyl phthalate was rapidly degraded by organisms in the system, having a half-life of 5 days(3). The degradation products of di-n-octyl phthalate are the monoester and phthalic acid(3); hydrolysis is believed to be accomplished by specific esterases only(4). Respirometric measurements of soil amended with di-n-octyl phthalate shows that when acclimated, there is some microbial utilization, although this is marginal at 4 and 10 \u00b0C(4). When subjected to high-rate composting in an artificial compost mixture, 69% and 92% were removed after 7 and 30 days, respectively(5). Di-n-octyl phthalate was degraded 68.8% in model waste stabilization ponds(6). Di-n-octyl phthalate was biodegraded 85% after 10 days incubation in Rhine river water at 20 \u00b0C; at 4 \u00b0C, biodegradation was negligible(7). Di-n-octyl phthalate was biodegraded 61% in 42 days and 83% in 63 days in sandy soil and sandy soil mixed with gravel/till taken from a plasticizer manufacturing site(8). Di-n-octyl phthalate, at a starting concentration of 10-100 mg/L, had a half-life of 498.6 hours in acclimated activated sludge(9).",

However, in a 33-day model ecosystem, mosquito fish placed in the system on day 30 had a BCF of 9400. This discrepancy in the BCF for the 33 and 3 day ecosystem is most likely due to the fact that a final water concentration in the 33 day experiment was used in determining bioconcentration and due to the degradation of the di-n-octyl phthalate, this water concentration was low(1). According to a classification scheme(2), these BCFs suggest that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low to very high(SRC). Bioaccumulation factors of 28,500 and 6800 were determined in the algae, Oedogonium cardiacum, after 33 and 3 days exposure to di-n-octyl phthalate, respectively(3). Bioaccumulation factors of 2600 and 9300 were measured in brine shrimp after 33 and 3 days exposure to di-n-octyl phthalate, respectively(3). A BCF of 1606 was measured in algae exposed to di-n-octyl phthalate in a model waste stabilization pond(4). BCFs of 0-8.43 were reported for di-n-octyl phthalate in water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica) grown under different conditions on sludge from waste water treatment plants in China(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

A sediment/water sample from the Lower Tennessee River below Calvert City, KY contained 150 ppb di-n-octyl phthalate(2). Di-n-octyl phthalate was also detected in an unspecified US river below a speciality chemical company at concentrations of 1-20 ppb(3). Di-n-octyl phthalate was isolated from Putah Creek water, CA in Dec 1993(4). Dioctyl phthalate, isomer unspecified, was detected in Mississippi River water at 24-310 ng/L; the lowest concentration occurred at the inflow of the Ohio River at Cario, IL, the highest concentration occurred after the influence of the industrial corridor, New Orleans, LA(5). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in the Lake Ontario Basin (Niagara River), Lake Michigan Basin (Pike River, Root River, Kinnickinnic River, Milwaukee River, Fox River, Duck Creek, Pensaukee River, Green Bay), and the Lake Superior Basin (St. Louis River, Central Basin, open waters)(6). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in water and suspended sediments collected from the Niagara River at Fort Erie and Niagara-on-the-Lake between Dec 1984 and March 1986(7). Di-n-octyl phthalate residues were detected in Klang river water, Malaysia between Jan 1992 and Feb 1993 at concentrations ranging from not detected to 1.5 ug/L(8). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in 1901 surface water samples from throughout Canada with a mean concentration of 1.35 ug/L(9). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in Huaihe River in the summer of 2002 at the concentration of 0.99-1.21, 0.55-0.98, and 0.86-1.11 ug/L at Xiao Zui, Huaihe River bridge, and Hongguang Chemical plant, China, respectively(10).",

Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected, not quantified in Fort Polk, LA (secondary effluent)(2). The average occurrence of di-n-octyl phthalate was 13.7% at 8700 ug/kg in soil, water and drum samples collected at 358 hazardous waste disposal sites(3). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in a fly ash-bottom ash mixture from unconditioned, unsorted municipal solid waste at a concentration of 930 ug/kg ash(4). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected at a maximum concentration of 4000 ug/kg at the Bayou Bonfouca hazardous waste site located in Slidell, Louisiana(5). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in aqueous industrial effluent extracts collected between Nov 1979-81 in the following industrial categories (concentration in one effluent extract, ng/uL): nonferrous metals (22,083); organics and plastics (12,161 and 23,704); and organic chemicals (2075)(6). Di-n-octyl phthalate was not detected in 4 domestic sewages; 3 domestic sewages with storm runoff and small industrial effluent were undetected for di-n-octyl phthalate, 3 domestic sewages with storm runoff and small industrial effluent had 629, 203 and 221 ug/kg of di-n-octyl phthalate; 2 domestic sewage with storm runoff and large industrial effluent had 235 and 354 ug/kg of di-n-octyl phthalate(7). Di-n-octyl phthalate was found in waste combustion ash at one of five US incinerators at a concentration of 2000 ug/kg(8). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in sludge samples at 87-220, 2933 and 6400 ug/kg in Southerly raw sludge, Jackson Pike combined domestic sludge and Jackson Pike oxidized sludge, respectively(9). In a nationwide survey of raw sludge, di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in 3% of the samples at 37-1024 mg/kg(9). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in 79 sludge samples taken throughout Canada at a mean concentration of 5420 ug/kg(10). Di-n-octyl phthalate was detected in 3 of 102 effluent samples from 52 treatment facilities located throughout Oregon at 95.6-158.0 ng/L; samples were collected the summer and fall of 2010(11).",

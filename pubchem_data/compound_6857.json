Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), for example, has A01AD05 as a drug for local oral treatment, B01AC06 as a platelet inhibitor, and N02BA01 as an analgesic and antipyretic. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.",

Acute animal studies consist of LD50 and LC50 tests, which present the median lethal dose (or concentration) to the animals. Acute human studies usually consist of case reports from accidental poisonings or industrial accidents. These case reports often help to define the levels at which acute toxic effects are seen in humans.",

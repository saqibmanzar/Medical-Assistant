When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

They are used in international commerce and transportation to identify hazardous materials and articles (such as explosives, flammable liquids, oxidizers, toxic liquids, etc.). With a few exceptions, UN numbers are usually identical to DOT (Department of Transportation) IDs [also known as NA (North America) numbers], which are issued by the United States Department of Transportation. Therefore, UN numbers are also called DOT IDs and NA numbers.",

They are intended for use as tools to assess the adequacy of accident prevention and emergency response plans, including transportation emergency planning, community emergency response plans, and incident prevention and mitigation.  ERPGs estimate the concentrations at which most people will begin to experience health effects if they are exposed to a hazardous airborne chemical for 1 hour. (Sensitive members of the public, such as old, sick, or very young people, aren't covered by these guidelines and they may experience adverse effects at concentrations below the ERPG values.) A chemical may have up to three ERPG values, each of which corresponds to a specific tier of health effects. ",

In addition, 1-pentene has been identified in emissions due to gasoline combustion, gasoline evaporation, and polymer combustion. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 635 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-pentene will exist solely as a vapor in the ambient atmosphere. Vapor-phase 1-pentene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 12 and 28 hours, respectively. If released to soil, 1-pentene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 81. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 0.40 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Pentene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. While biodegradation data in soil and water were not located, 1-pentene's linear, relatively low molecular weight, hydrocarbon structure suggests that biodegradation in both environments is expected to be an important fate process. If released into water, 1-pentene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment in water based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2.4 hours and 3.3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 22 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Occupational exposure to 1-pentene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound particularly at workplaces where gasoline or fuels are produced or used. The general population may be exposed to 1-pentene via inhalation of air while pumping gasoline at self-serve stationse. Monitoring data of ambient air indicate ppb levels of hydrocarbons including 1-pentene are often present. (SRC)",

The carbonyl products of the gas-phase reaction of OH radicals with 1-pentene were (product, yield): butanal, 0.73; formaldehyde, 0.88(1). The product yield data suggest that the intermediate beta-hydroxylalkoxy radicals undergo isomerization and/or reaction with O2 in competition with decomposition, and the decrease in the carbonyl and formaldehyde yields with increasing carbon number in the 1-alkene series from 1-butene to 1-octene indicate that isomerization of the intermediate beta-hydroxyalkoxy radical is unimportant for 1-butene and dominating for 1-octene(1,2). Products of the gas-phase reaction of ozone with 1-pentene, in the presence of an hydroxyl radical scavenger were (product, yield): butanal, 0.54; formaldehyde, 0.595(3). Another study reported that the gas phase reaction of ozone with 1-pentene, in the presence of cyclohexane, produced (product, yield): formaldehyde, 0.505; propanal, 0.117; butanal, 0.496; cyclohexanone, 0.049; 2-oxobutanal, 0.029(7). Ambient air collected from the atmosphere in downtown Los Angeles, CA during the morning traffic peak hours was irradiated with solar radiation; 90% conversion of 1-pentene was reported in 6 hours (4). A photochemical ozone creation potential from 68.5 to 103.7, relative to ethylene (=100), was calculated for 1-pentene over a 5-day period from the peak ozone concn reached in the afternoon for emissions in the United Kingdom (5). The average rate of nitric oxide photooxidation in the presence of 1-pentene is 2.1 ppb/minute; reactivity was shown, in general, to increase with substitution at the double bond and to decrease with increasing chain length once 6 carbons were reached (6). Irradiation of 1-pentene with nitrogen oxides and air resulted in an ozone formation rate of 1.7 ppb/minute(8). A second study reported an ozone formation rate of 1.6 ppb/minute following the reaction of 1-pentene with nitrogen oxides(9).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Emissions of 1-pentene from motor vehicles, measured inside the Van Nuys Tunnel, Los Angeles, CA in 1993 were determined to average 27 mg 1-pentene/l fuel consumed (2). Average concns of 1-pentene in light vehicle exhaust emissions as weight % of non-methane hydrocarbons are 0.29, 0.10, 0.00, 0.00, and 0.13 for exhaust in the Caldecott Tunnel (San Francisco), incremental cold start, stabilized emissions, hot start emissions, emissions from the current (1989) fleet, and emissions from an older fleet (1983 to 1985), respectively (3). 1-Pentene was measured in evaporative emissions from gasoline at average concns, as weight % of non-methane hydrocarbons, of 0.57, 0.31, and 0.43 for average diurnal, hot soak, and running loss emissions, respectively, from the older fleet vehicles (1983 to 1985) (3). Concns of 1-pentene in the Lincoln Tunnel during a 1982 study in 1982 and 1970 were 15.8 and 69.2 ppbC, respectively (7). Light-duty vehicle emissions measured at the Caldecott Tunnel, San Francisco, in August and October 1994 contained 1-pentene at 0.16 and 0.20 wt% total volatile organic compounds, respectively (9). 1-Pentene was detected in the Tingstad Tunnel, Goteborg, Sweden, at 0.15 to 0.22 % of the total non-methane volatile hydrocarbons over 5 different sampling days (8). 1-Pentene was measured in the exhaust of 67 vehicles representative of the Sydney, Australia fleet at an average concn of 0.2 %wt/wt non-methane hydrocarbons (4). 1-Pentene was emitted in the exhaust of 10 small lawnmower engines at 0.22 and 0.19 % of the total organic emissions, for two different gasolines (5). Exhaust from a new Honda moped (model PK 50 Wallaroo), run using a conventional reformate-based gasoline, contained 1-pentene at 0.23 % by weight of non-methane hydrocarbons(6).",

Air samples collected from the 6th floor of a building in the Los Angeles central business district (from August through November 1960 in the early morning) contained 1-pentene at concns from 0.001 to 0.012 ppmv(2). The median concn of 1-pentene measured between 6 and 9 a.m. in the summers of 1984, 1985, 1986 in 39 U.S. cities (between 26 deg N and 43 deg N latitude) was 1.7 ppbC(3). Concns of 1-pentene ranged from 1.0 to 5.0 ppb in ambient air samples collected at the Riverside CA County Building of Health and Finance between August 1965 and March 1966 in the early morning (4). 1-Pentene was measured in air samples collected over Lake Michigan within a plume from Milwaukee at average concns of 0.8 and 0.1 ppbv for measurements on two consecutive days in August 1976 (5). Air samples collected from the industrial area of Houston, TX, contained 1-pentene at concns of 1.2 to 38.4, 5.9 to 28.9 and 0.5 to 6.0 ppbC on separate days in September 1973, January 1974, and April, 1974, respectively(6). An air sample collected from a downtown location in Miami, FL contained 1-pentene at 0.7 ppbC(7). Concns of 1-pentene ranged from below the detection limit (detection limit not reported) to 1.4 ppbv (mean=0.12 ppbv) at a location in Washington, DC; samples were collected every sixth day over a 1 year period (1990 to 1991)(8). Air samples taken from downtown Tulsa, OK contained 1-pentene at 0.8 to 2.2 ppbC; air samples collected 0.8 miles downwind from a Texaco refinery complex in Tulsa contained 1-pentene at 1.8 to 2.8 ppbC(9).",

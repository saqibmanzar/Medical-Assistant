The photomodified ADBAQ (mixtures of ADBAQ and its photoproducts) was less phototoxic than the intact ADBAQ. The SSR-only or ADBAQ-only treatments did not affect the ROS level in D. magna, whereas increased ROS levels were observed in the presence of SSR and ADBAQ ... The antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, decreased the photoinduced oxidative damage to D. magna, probably by scavenging ROS ...",

Some evidence suggests that anthraquinone dye workers may have an increased risk of cancer. Significant excesses of esophageal and prostate cancer occurred among workers in some areas of a Scottish anthraquinone dyestuffs plant, and excesses of lung and central nervous system cancer occurred among workers at a New Jersey anthraquinone dye and epichlorohydrin plant. Nevertheless, estimates of risk in all studies were based on small numbers of cancer deaths, and workers may have been exposed to other carcinogens.",

ADBAQ stained the skin and fur red at all doses in rats and at 1.00% and higher concentrations in mice. Lethargy and emaciation were noted at the 2.50% and higher doses in rats of both sexes. In general, the absolute weight of the liver and the liver/organ weight ratios increased in both sexes and species at all doses. Treated rats developed a chronic toxic hepatitis characterized by hepatocytomegaly, centrilobular vacuolar degeneration and necrosis, regenerative nodules, acute necrotizing cholangitis, bile duct hyperplasia, chronic active inflammation in periportal areas, and focal pigmentation. The hepatopathy occurred at all doses in males and at 0.50% and higher in females and correlated with elevations of serum glutamic-pyruvic and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminases, leukocytosis, and neutrophilia. Hyaline droplet degeneration in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys occurred in male rats, and uterine atrophy was observed in female rats at 1.00% and higher. Anemia occurred in both sexes of rats at all doses and thymic atrophy was observed in both sexes of high-dose rats. In male mice minimal dose-related lesions in the liver included centrilobular glycogen depletion at 1.00% and higher and pigmentation at all doses. At comparable doses, ADBAQ was considered to be markedly toxic in rats and of minimal nonlife-threatening toxicity in mice.",

In rats, anthraquinone induced tumors in the liver, kidney, and urinary bladder. A 2-amino substitution narrowed the carcinogenicity to the liver, while multiple amino substitutions led to a carcinogenic response in the urinary bladder alone. A methyl substitution ortho to a 1-aminogroup preserved the hepatic and renal neoplasms seen with the parent anthraquinone, but did not induce urinary bladder tumors; amino or bromo substitutions para to a 1-amino group were related to urinary bladder neoplasms. The intestine may have been a target organ for bromine-substituted anthraquinones. The presence of a nitro group altered the targets of carcinogenicity, and skin tumors may have been associated with this particular functional group in both rats and mice. Over-all for mice, the findings were somewhat different and limited by the small number of common target organs. The parent anthraquinone was clearly carcinogenic only to the liver. There were no other effects of single amino substitutions, in the presence or absence of an additional methyl group, on the carcinogenicity or the site of carcinogenesis of anthraquinone in mice.

C.I. Solvent Yellow 14, monuron, chlorendic acid, and 4-hydroxyacetanilide were tested for initiating and promoting activity in the PH model. Chlorendic acid, 4,4'-oxydianiline, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone (ADBAQ), and 4-hydroxyacetanilide were similarly tested in a neonatal rat liver focus model. With the exception of 4-hydroxyacetanilide which was not carcinogenic in the NTP studies, all chemicals tested showed clear evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity. While none of the chemicals showed initiating activity in either the PH or neonatal models, promoting activity, as indicated by increased number, size, or volume fraction of histochemically detected hepatic foci of cellular alteration, was evident for all chemicals with previously demonstrated hepatocarcinogenicity. Liver tumor incidence was documented at 14 months in the PH model and at 300 days in the neonatal model. On the basis of the results obtained from these few chemicals, it is suggested that the use of short-term rat liver focus models may represent a reliable means for identifying chemicals with hepatocarcinogenic potential.",

In addition, groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were given 2,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 104 wk. These exposure concn were approximately equal to 90, 240, or 490 mg 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/kg bw for males and 110, 285, or 600 mg/kg for females. Ten animals from each group were evaluated for histopathology at 9 mo. Additional groups of 10 animals from the 0 and 10,000 ppm groups were evaluated for histopathology at 15 mo. 2 YR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were given 0, 10,000, or 20,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 104 wk. The daily compound consumption was approximately 1,690 or 3,470 mg 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/kg body weight for males and 1,950 or 4,350 mg/kg for females. Ten animals from each group were evaluated for histopathology at l S mo. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2 yr feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of l-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in male and female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, large intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in male and female B6C3Fl mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung. Exposure of male and female rats to 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone for 2 yr was associated with basophilic focus (males only), clear cell focus, eosinophilic focus, and pigmentation in the liver; renal tubule hyperplasia, renal tubule pigmentation, and transitional cell hyperplasia in the kidney; transitional cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and stromal metaplasia (females only) in the urinary bladder; squamous hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, ulceration, and inflammation of the forestomach mucosa; and seminal vesicle atrophy. Exposure of male and female mice to 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone for 2 yr was associated with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy (males only), basophilic focus, clear cell focus (femalesonly), eosinophilic focus, and pigmentation in the liver; pigmentation in the kidney; and hyperplasia, basal cell hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and inflammation of the forestomach mucosa.",

If released to air, an estimated vapor pressure of 1.4X10-9 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone will exist solely in the particulate phase in the atmosphere. Particulate-phase 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone will be removed from the atmosphere by wet or dry deposition. 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone contains chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and therefore may be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone is expected to have no mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 6,600. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon an estimated Henry's Law constant of 1.8X10-13 atm-cu m/mole. Biodegradation data were not available. If released into water, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's estimated Henry's Law constant. An estimated BCF of 380 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions.

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

The brand name of a product is commonly used to indicate the primary chemical ingredient(s) in the product (e.g., Tylenol, a common pain killer, is often used for acetaminophen, its active ingredient).  Another example of common synonyms is record identifiers used in different data collections, such as Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry numbers, FDA UNII (Unique Ingredient Identifiers), and many others.

Density is mass of a unit volume of a compound and commonly expressed in units of kg/m3 or g/cm3. Specific gravity, also known as relative density, is a unit-less quantity, defined as the ratio of the density of a compound to that of a standard reference material (typically, water at 4 \u00b0C for liquids and air at room temperature [20 \u00b0C or 68 \u00b0F] for gases).",

This ratio is therefore used to compare the solubilities of the solute in these two solvents.  Because octanol and water are the most commonly used pair of solvents for measuring partition coefficients, the Log P values listed in this section refer to octanol/water partition coefficients, unless indicated otherwise.",

ATR is a sampling technique that enables samples to be examined directly in the solid or liquid state without further preparation.  ATR-IR can be applied to the same chemical or biological systems as the transmission IR.  An advantage of ATR-IR over the transmission IR is the limited path length into the sample, because ATR-IR avoids the problem of strong attenuation of the IR signal in highly absorbing media such as aqueous solutions.",

Seven metabolites were identified by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, UV, and mass spectral techniques as 6-hydroxyacenaphthenone (24.8%), 1,2-acenaphthenedione (19.9%), trans-1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthene (10.3%), 1,5-dihydroxyacenaphthene (2.7%), 1-acenaphthenol (2.4%), 1-acenaphthenone (2.1%), and cis-1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthene (1.8%). Parallel experiments with rat liver microsomes indicated that the major metabolite formed from acenaphthene by rat liver microsomes was 1-acenaphthenone. The fungal metabolism of acenaphthene was similar to bacterial and mammalian metabolism, since the primary site of enzymatic attack was on the two carbons of the five-member ring.",

Both organisms oxidized acenaphthene to the same spectrum of metabolites, which included 1-acenaphthenol, 1-acenaphtheneone, 1,2-acenaphthenediol, acenaphthenequinone, and a compound that was tentatively identified as 1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthylene. In contrast, acenaphthylene was oxidized to acenaphthenequinone and the compound tentatively identified as 1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthylene was also formed when the organism was incubated with synthetic cis-1,2-acenaphthenediol. A metabolite identified as cis-1,2-acenaphthenediol was formed from acenaphthylene by the mutant Beijerinckia species strain B8/36. Cell extracts prepared from the wild-type Beijerinckia strain contain a constitutive pyridine nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase which can oxidize 1-acenaphthenol and 9-fluorenol. The results indicate that although acenaphthene and acenaphthylene are both oxidized to acenaphthenequinone, the pathways leading to the formation of this end product are different.",

Others are contained in asphalt used in road construction. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil, coal, coal tar pitch, creosote, and roofing tar.

The analytical technique utilized reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for separation of individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with fluorescence detection, which is sensitive and specific. A specific sample cleanup was employed prior to measurement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, designed to provide a fraction enriched in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and free from the biologic matrix. Sample extracts, in 0.5 mL hexane, were applied to a silica gel column (0.8x10 cm, 1.4 g) topped with 0.5 cm sodium sulfate. A 4 mL hexane fraction was discarded, and a second fraction of 13 mL cyclohexane was collected & concentrated under dry nitrogen to about 0.1 mL. In six serum samples, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were below the limit of detection (1-60 pg/mL). /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

[2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a group of chemicals that are formed during the incomplete burning of coal, oil, gas, wood, garbage, or other organic substances, such as tobacco and charbroiled meat. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Acenaphthene is oxidized by human P450s 2A6 and 2A13 and other P450s to form several mono- and dioxygenated products. ANIMAL STUDIES: Acenaphthene at 2 g/kg body weight administered orally to seven young rats daily for 32 days caused loss of body weight and changes in peripheral blood, increased aminotransferase levels in blood serum, and produced mild morphological damage to both the liver and kidney. 100 rats were exposed for 5-months to acenaphthene at a level of 12 mg/cu m for four hours a day, six days per week. Toxic effects on the blood, lung, and glandular constituents were observed. The bronchial epithelium showed hyperplasia and metaplasia, which may have been symptoms of the pneumonia that killed a large number of animals. No signs of malignancy appeared during the 8-month post-exposure observation period. Acenaphthene at 0.10 % accelerated the liver regeneration in partially hepatectomized male rats. An acenaphthene-containing aromatic subfraction was isolated from shale-derived crude oil and tested for mutagenicity using Salmonella typhimurium TA98. No increases in mutation frequency were observed with or without metabolic activation. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Treatment of Allium cepa root meristem cells with acenaphthene vapor for 12-96 hr caused anomalies leading to random development of the cells. It caused disorientation of microtubules, in Allium cepa and Phleoeum pratense, resulting in altered cellular expansion. A set of embryo-larval bioassays were conducted with the fathead minnow. The no effect levels when compared to the controls was 0.226 mg/L acenaphthene.",

Examination of the oral cavity, respiratory tract, bladder, and kidneys should be stressed. The skin should be examined for evidence of chronic disorders, for premalignant and malignant lesions, and evidence of hyperpigmentation or photosensitivity. Urinalysis: ... A urinalysis should be obtained to include at a minimum specific gravity, albumin, glucose, and a microscopic /examination/ on centrifuged sediment, as well as a test for red blood cells. Urinary cytology: ... Employees having 5 or more years of exposure or who are 45 years of age or older should have a urinary cytology examination. Sputum cytology: ...

The monoalkylbenzenes proved ineffective by injection except for ethylbenzene and possibly n-propylbenzene and the introduction of the double or triple bond in the side-chain as exemplified by styrene and phenylacetylene, led to little change over the respective controls. A number of noncarcinogenic hydrocarbons accelerated the regenerative process but much higher s.c. dosages were required as compared to the carcinogenic hydrocarbons. As tested by the dietary route, the optimum effect among the phenylmethanes was reached with diphenylmethane, toluene, tri- and tetraphenylmethanes and the Sn analog, tin tetraphenyl being inactive. With the diets, carcinogens as BP or DBA at 0.10% were without effect whereas acenaphthene or fluoranthene at this level accelerated the regeneration. Although diets supplemented with anthracene or octahydroanthracene led to little change in liver increment, 9,10-dihydroanthracene, anthraquinone and anthrone comprised liver stimulants, an activity which did not extend to phenanthraquinone. Aniline and triphenylamine did not alter the control increment but diphenylamine was active as was also the case with o- and m-terphenyls, the p-isomer being ineffective. Although naphthalene lacked activity by either route, 1- and 2-phenylnaphthalenes proved stimulatory by injection and 1- and 2-naphthylamines, by diet. Among other derivatives, phenyl sulfide and its sulfoxide and sulfone were quite stimulatory in addition to heterocyclic S compound as benzothiophene, phenothiazine, phenoxathiin and thianthrene but not thianaphthene at the dietary levels screened. Several series were conducted with intact rats under the above conditions; ethyl-benzene and phenathrene injected s.c. at high levels did not alter the control dry- or wet liver-body weight ratios.",

Static 48 hr acute toxicity tests employed third instar larvae, and the flow-through 20-day life cycle tests were initiated with eggs. No acute lethal effect was observed in the saturated concentration (2.1 mg/L) of acenaphthene in water, and the median lethal concentration of 2,4,6-TCP was approximately 40 mg/L. In the life cycle toxicity test with acenaphthene, hatchability of the midge was affected by 50% at an exposure concentration of approximately 0.17 mg/L. The median effective concentration for larval, pupal, and adult development was found between 0.06 and 0.07 mg/L, respectively, and these were significantly lower than the effective concentration for hatching success. With regard to 2,4,6-TCP toxicity, the median effective concentration for midge hatchability was 4.23 mg/L. The larval development, pupal formation and adult emergence, however, were impeded at 1.60, 1.46, and 1.33 mg/L, respectively. Each level was noticeably lower than the median effective concentration for hatchability. The concentrations for each compound that interfered with the development to fourth instar, pupa, and adult were not significantly different. These results indicate that larval developments after hatching were the most sensitive stages and affected the success of midge growth.",

It is a member of a group of chemicals called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are emitted in exhaust from gasoline and diesel engines and in emissions from the burning of oil, coal and wood. Environmental emission sources include municipal waste incineration, tobacco smoke, wastewater treatment effluents and use of creosote wood preservatives. Acenaphthene occurs in petroleum and coal tar. If released to air, a vapor pressure of 0.0022 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates acenaphthene will exist solely as a vapor in the atmosphere. However, gas/particle partitioning studies in chambers and outdoor monitoring have shown that acenaphthene can exist in both the vapor and particulate phases. Vapor-phase acenaphthene will be degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals and with night-time nitrate radicals; the half-lives for these reactions in air are estimated to be 3.9 and 1.9 hours, respectively. Particulate-phase acenaphthene will be removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry deposition. Acenaphthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, acenaphthene is expected to have slight to no mobility based upon a Koc range of 2510 to 2.14X10+5. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.84X10-4 atm-cu m/mole. However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization. Acenaphthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. The biodegradation half-life of acenaphthene in soil has been reported to range from less than 10 days to over 100 days. The presence of acclimated microbes appears to be an important factor in the degradation rate. In addition, acenaphthene has been shown to biodegrade readily in acclimated soil at low concentrations (5 mg/kg), but not at high concentrations (500 mg/kg), perhaps due to toxicity to the microbes. The photolysis of acenaphthene, sorbed on surfaces of needles of a spruce tree, had a half-life of 45 hours under sunlight irradation. If released into water, acenaphthene is expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the Koc. Acenaphthene was shown to biodegrade readily using acclimated groundwater aquifer inoculum, but very slowly using unacclimated or sterilized materials. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9.6 hours and 6.7 days, respectively. However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. A BCF range of 254-1270 suggests bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high. PAHs may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as some fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions. Occupational exposure to acenaphthene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where acenaphthene is produced or used. Monitoring data indicate that the general population may be exposed to acenaphthene via inhalation of ambient air, inhalation of tobacco smoke, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing acenaphthene.

PAHs generally occur as complex mixtures, for example as part of combustion products such as soot, not as single compounds. PAHs usually occur naturally. They can also be found in substances such as crude oil and coal. They are found throughout the environment in the air, water, and soil(1). /Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/",

Volatilization of acenaphthene from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process(SRC) given a Henry's Law constant of 1.84X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(4). However, adsorption to soil is expected to attenuate volatilization(SRC). Acenaphthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.0022 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(5). The biodegradation half-life of acenaphthene in soil has been reported to range from less than 10 days(6) to over 100 days(7). The presence of acclimated microbes appears to be an important factor in the degradation rate(8). In addition, acenaphthene has been shown to biodegrade readily in acclimated soil at low concentrations (5 mg/kg), but not at high concentrations (500 mg/kg), perhaps due to toxicity to the microbes(9). Acenaphthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(10) and is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis on soil surfaces exposed to sunlight(11). The photolysis of acenaphthene, sorbed on surfaces of needles of a spruce tree, had a half-life of 45 hours under sunlight irradiation(12).",

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(4) based upon a Henry's Law constant of 1.84X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(5). Using this Henry's Law constant and an estimation method(4), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 9.6 hours and 6.7 days, respectively(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column. The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is on the order of 1 to 10 months if adsorption is considered(6). According to a classification scheme(7), an observed BCF range of 254-1270(8) suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high, provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including acenaphthene, may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as some fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(9). The presence of acclimated microbes appears to be an important factor in the degradation rate in water(10). Acenaphthene was shown to biodegrade readily using acclimated groundwater aquifer inoculum, but very slowly using unacclimated or sterilized materials(10). The biotransformation half-lives for 2 mg/L of acenaphthene in pond and lake water with decreasing amounts of suspended solids range from 20 hours to 24.8 days for zero suspended solids(11). Acenaphthene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Acenaphthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(12) and is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis at water surfaces exposed to sunlight(13).",

However, gas/particle partitioning studies in chambers and outdoor monitoring have shown that acenaphthene can exist in both the vapor and particulate phases(3). Vapor-phase acenaphthene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 3.9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 9.89X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). Vapor-phase acenaphthene is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with night-time nitrate radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 1.9 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 4.16X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(4). Particulate-phase acenaphthene may be removed from the air by wet and dry deposition(SRC). Acenaphthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

Biodegradation is the breakdown of organic matter by microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi.  An important measure of biodegradability of wastewater is the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period.

Grab samples of groundwater aquifer soil that had acclimated to creosote wastes containing acenaphthene were able to degrade acenaphthene at concentration between 0.02 and 0.12 ppm under aerobic conditions at 25 \u00b0C for a 56 day period at an average rate of 130% per week(2); an average loss of 5.0% per week was observed for autoclaved controls(2). Unacclimated material from the same aquifer degraded acenaphthene at an average rate of 6.6% per week; however, autoclaved controls lost acenaphthene at an overall rate of 9.2% per week(2). The biotransformation half-life for 2 mg/L of acenaphthene in hard water with zero suspended solids was 24.8 days(3). The half-lives for 2 mg/L of acenaphthene in hard water with suspended solid concentration of 52, 403 and 601 mg/L from Roselawn Pond, Denton, TX were 3.52, 4.03 and 2.23 days, respectively(3). The half-lives for 2 mg/L of acenaphthene in hard water with suspended solid concentrations of 83, 397 and 591 mg/L from Pat Mayseake, Paris, TX were 4.91, 1.20 and 0.83 days, respectively(3); all half-lives were corrected for abiotic losses by controls(3). Acenaphthene, present at 100 mg/L, reached 0% of its theoretical BOD in 4 weeks using an activated sludge inoculum at 30 mg/L in the Japanese MITI test(4).",

Under aerobic conditions, acenaphthene at a concentration of 1 mg/L was degraded to non-detectable levels in 10 days using a mineral salts solution inoculated with 1 g of soil(2). At a concentration of 5 mg/kg of average-humus, lightly grained chernozem soil and at 20 \u00b0C, acenaphthene degraded in 24 hr(3); however, acenaphthene did not degrade in soil at a concentration of 500 mg/kg(3). In 76 days, 1296 mg/kg of acenaphthene in a mixture of oil sludge degraded to 375 mg/kg in a derby soil column with nitrogen and phosphorous additions(4). In 83 days, 3013 mg/kg of acenaphthene in a wood preserving sludge degraded to 2066 mg/kg in a Derby soil column with nitrogen and phosphorous additions(4). The succeeding first order rate constants are 0.0163 and 0.0045 day-1 which correspond to half-lives of 42.5 and 102.4 days, respectively(4).",

Two parallel 0.1 l/s (1.5-g/m) treatment sequences were operated: a control and an experimental sequence spiked with the 22 compounds being investigated. The organic compounds studied, spiked at a normal concentration of 50 ug/L each, were typically removed to the 95-98% level. Many were partitioned to the primary and return activated sludges. For acenaphthene, 48% of spiked acenaphthene was recovered with 41% in the primary sludge and 3% in the activated sludge effluent(1).",

In one specific test protocol (non-acclimated soil), acenaphthene (and fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene and pyrene) did not degrade much faster in non-sterile versus sterile control soils over a 90-day incubation. However, when consortia-treated river sediments from a polluted river were added, percentage of remaining acenaphthene dropped from 91-92% to 23-44%, suggesting an importance of acclimated microbes(2).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 3.9 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of acenaphthene with ozone has been measured as 1.79X10-19 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(1). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 64 days at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(2). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of acenaphthene with night-time nitrate radicals is 4.16X10-13 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(1).  This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 1.9 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 2.5X10+8 nitrate radicals per cu cm(3). Acenaphthene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(4). Acenaphthene absorbs strongly at wavelengths >290 nm(5) and, therefore, is expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC). The rate constant for the direct photolysis of acenaphthene in a Pyrex beaker of distilled water maintained at 20 \u00b0C and exposed to a 100W mercury lamp for 96 hours was measured to be 0.230 per hour, which corresponds to a half-life of about 3 hours(6). Photolytic half-lives of acenaphthene absorb onto silica gel, alumina and fly ash were 2.0, 2.2 and 44 hours, respectively; when placed in a Pyrex photoreactor and exposed to a 450W medium pressure mercury lamp, which had an irradiance of 17.6 W/sq m between the spectral region of 300 to 410 nm(7). Acenaphthene absorbed onto coal fly ash was stabilized against photo-oxidation(8). The photolysis of acenaphthene, sorbed on surfaces of needles of a spruce tree, had a half-life of 45 hours under sunlight irradiation(9).",

A BCF range of 254-1270 was measured in fish for acenaphthene(SRC), using carp (Cyprinus carpio) which were exposed over an 8-week period to 0.003-0.03 mg/L(3). According to a classification scheme(4), the BCF range suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high to very high(SRC), provided the compound is not metabolized by the organism(SRC). PAHs may not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms which contain microsomal oxidase, such as fish, as this enzyme enables the rapid metabolism of certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(4). Some marine organisms have no detectable aryl hydrocarbons hydroxylase enzyme systems, namely: phytoplankton, certain zooplankton, mussels (Mytilus edulis), scallops (Placopecten sp), and snails (Litternia littorea)(5). Those organisms which lack a metabolic detoxification enzyme system, tend to accumulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(5).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

This Henry's Law constant indicates that acenaphthene is expected to volatilize from water surfaces(2). Based on this Henry's Law constant, the volatilization half-life from a model river (1 m deep, flowing 1 m/sec, wind velocity of 3 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 9.6 hours(SRC). The volatilization half-life from a model lake (1 m deep, flowing 0.05 m/sec, wind velocity of 0.5 m/sec)(2) is estimated as 6.7 days(SRC). However, volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be attenuated by adsorption to suspended solids and sediment in the water column.  The estimated volatilization half-life from a model pond is on the order of 1 to 10 months if adsorption is considered(3). Acenaphthene's Henry's Law constant indicates that volatilization from moist soil surfaces may occur(SRC). Acenaphthene is not expected to volatilize from dry soil surfaces(SRC) based upon a vapor pressure of 0.0022 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C(4). However, it has been reported that the lower molecular weight PAHs, including acenaphthene, may volatilize from soil(5).",

Acenaphthene was detected at 3 of 4 sampling stations along the Mississippi River at an average concentration of 2 ng/L(3). Ohio River water contained acenaphthene at the cities of Wheeling, Huntington and Cincinnati(4). The maximum concentration of acenaphthene reported for waters of the Rhine River, Netherlands was 30 ng/L(5,6). Samples collected from five rivers/streams in Sweden and Lithuania in 2001 had dissolved acenaphthene levels as high as 1-2 ng/L(7).  Acenaphthene was detected in Yellow River water, Peoples Republic of China(8).",

Six of 8 samples of fly ash from a municipal waste incinerator in Ontario, Canada contained acenaphthene at concentrations of less than 0.5, less than 0.5, 3, 5, 5, 21 and 28 ng/g(5). On July 28, 1978 and Nov 15-21 1980, the final effluent from the Los Angeles Co municipal wastewater treatment plant contained acenaphthene at an average concentration of 7 and less than 10 ug/L(6). Acenaphthene was identified as a product of coal combustion(7). Diesel fueled engines were found to emit acenaphthene in the exhaust(8). Acenaphthene was detected in exhaust particulate matter from light-duty gasoline and diesel motor vehicles(9). Average emission rates of acenaphthene from in-use monitoring of 1990-1997 model-year gasoline vehicles ranged from 0.0463-0.5332 mg/mile(10). The emission rate of acenaphthene from a gasoline catalyst-equipped versus noncatylst-equipped vehicle was 6.55 versus 177 ug/km, respectively(11). Acenaphthene was detected in the exhaust emitted by two passenger ferries using diesel motors at concentrations of 23 and 1.0 ug/cu m(12). Studies involving the combustion of scrap tires determined acenaphthene emission rates of 3-77 mg/kg scrap tire(13).",

Reactor tar from a coal gasification plant contained acenaphthene at a concentration of 9.0 mg/g(2). Leachate from coal piles in IL contained acenaphthene at concentration of 1 ug/L(3). Coal tar leachate was found to contain acenaphthene(4). Wastewater from the gaseous diffusion plant operated by Union Carbide at Oak Ridge, TN contained acenaphthene in the volatile fraction(5). Leachate from Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corp disposal site at Love Canal, NY contained acenaphthene(6). Emissions from the pouring, cooling and shakeout of iron castings contained acenaphthene at an average concentration of 230 ug/kg(7). Effluent from a textile finishing operation also contained acenaphthene(8). As of 1985, acenaphthene had a median concentration less than 10.0 ug/L and tested positive in 3.6% of 1,253 industrial discharges waste waters from the EPA's STORET database(9). In samples of domestic wastewaters, acenaphthene was detected at a mean concentration of 0.14 ug/L(10). Sewage sludge collected from six wastewater treatment plants in Beijing, China during 2004-2005 contained acenaphthene at levels of 3.11-131.14 ug/kg dry weight(11). An Oregon state-wide study of compounds in municipal effluents detected acenaphthene (detection limit 7.7 ng/L) on 1 of 102 samples at a concentration 16.2 ng/L(12).",

The average day and night time concentrations of acenapthene were 5 and 25 ng/cu m, respectively, for air of Glendora, CA in August 1981(3). Acenaphthene was detected in aerosol particulate samples collected in Kenmore Square, MA in 1994(4). Outdoor air samples collected from Fairbanks, Alaska in Feb 2009 had a acenaphthene concentration of 0.9 mg/cu m(5). Acenaphthene was detected in the urban atmospheres of several cities in southern Ontario, Canada(6).  Acenaphthene was detected in the air of Sundsvall, Sweden(7) and Paris, France(8). The average concentration of acenaphthene was 32.5 ng/cu m for 12 air samples in Norway(9). The winter, spring, summer and fall concentrations of acenaphthene in the ambient air of Hoyanger, Mosjoen, Ovre Ardal and Ardalstangen, Norway were 129, 121, 74 and 107; 52, 109, 121 and 29; 372, 193, 30 and 1666; and 327, 158, 59 and 73 ng/cu m, respectively(10).

Levels of acenaphthene detected in olive pomace oil in Spain ranged from 0.45-1.10 ug/kg(7). The following concentrations of acenaphthene (in ug/kg fresh wt) were detected in samples collected in the Czech Republic in 2003): cucumber, 0.07-0.45; parsley, 0.66-3.64; tomato, <0.07-0.16; apple, 0.17-0.31(8). Maximum acenaphthene levels (in ng/g wet wt) were detected in the following food items collected in Hong Kong in 2007: coconut milk (1.57), chicken breast (1.99), white wine (1.13), red wine (1.17), edible oils (1.34-3.07), pistachio (2.89), various seeds and nuts (1.57-3.09)(9). Acenaphthene was detected in the smoke from frying canola oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and in fumes from fried chicken legs(10). Acenaphthene was detected in emissions from the charbroiling and grilling of beef and chicken(11).",

Both oysters and clams from Lake Pontchartrain, LA contained acenaphthene at an average concentration of 46 ppb(3). Fish samples from the Great Lakes harbors and tributary mouths contained acenaphthene(4,5). Snails from 2 sites at Pensacola Bay, FL contained acenaphthene at average concentration of 2.06 and 8.80 ug/kg(6). Coral rock oysters (Saccostrea cucculata) collected in Sept 1982 from six locations at Mermaid Sound in NW Australia contained acenaphthene at concentrations ranging from less than 0.2 to 2 ppb with a 65% frequency of occurrence(7). Acenaphthene was detected in mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) from the Thermaikos Gulf, Greece(8). Acenaphthene concentrations of 0.15-16 ng/g wet weight were detected in oysters collected from 18 stations in the Yatsushiro Sea, Japan in 2010(9). An analysis of farmed and wild salmon, collected in 1999-2000, found mean acenaphthene concentrations of 0.83 and 1.10 ng/g, respectively(10). Edible fish taken from the Gornti River, India in 2004-2005 contained a mean acenaphthene + fluorene concentration of 0.92 ng/g wet wt with detection in 50% of all samples(11).",

Various types of incense were found to have acenaphthene emission rates of 4.92-269 ng/minute(4). Mean acenaphthene levels of 5.1-30.6 ug/kg were detected in kitchen dust samples collected from homes that cook with wood, kerosene or butane(5). House dust samples collected from homes in Columbus, OH during the heating season of 1992/1993 contained acenaphthene levels 1.31 ppm(6). Stack emissions from four restaurants in Taiwan had acenaphthene concentrations ranging from 0.120-2.33 ug/cu m(7). The emission rate of acenaphthene from the fireplace combustion of wood (pine, oak, eucalyptus) was 0.893-2.02 mg/kg wood burned(8). Acenaphthene vapor emission rates of 0.13-1.71 mg/kg dry wood were detected from the combustion in wood heaters(9).

Therefore, 31 samples of mosque's carpet dust from Riyadh were collected. The results showed that 14 PAHs were present in the dust samples with concentrations ranged from 90 to 22,146 ng/g (mean = 4096 ng/g) where low molecular weight compounds were dominant. The presence of PAHs were in the order of naphthalene > chrysene and benzo(b)fluoranthene > benzo(a)pyrene > acenaphthene and benzo(k)fluoranthene > pyrene and the absence of indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene and dibenz(a,h)anthracene. The diagnostic ratio coupled with principle component analysis (PCA) revealed mix sources of petrogenic from traffic, stack emission, and pyrogenic inputs from essence and perfumed wood burning. Trace metals were significant in the dust samples, and their concentrations decrease in the order of Zn, Mn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni, and V where Zn being the highest (94.4 ug/g) and indium was the lowest (1.9 ug/g). The trace metals were major in southern and central parts of Riyadh and followed the order of central Riyadh > southern Riyadh > western Riyadh > eastern Riyadh > northern Riyadh. Estimated risk based on the total PAHs was found to be 4.30X10-11 for adult and 1.56X10-11 for children. Elemental non-cancer risk for adults ranged from 7.9X10-4 for Co to 7.58X10-1 for Li and for children ranged from 3.70X10-3 for Co to 3.54 for Li.

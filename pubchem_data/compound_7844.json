When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically.

The concentrations of the alkenes were measured in blood, lung, brain, liver, kidney and peri-renal fat immediately after each exposure and 12 hr after the third exposure. DNA adducts were determined by (32)P-postlabeling in liver. Hemoglobin adducts were determined in erythrocytes by GC/MS and GC/MS/MS. Concentrations of 1-alkenes in blood and organs reached a steady-state level after the first 12 hr exposure, and the concentrations 12 hr after the last exposure were generally low, except in fat. Concentrations of 1-alkenes in blood and the different tissues increased with increasing number of carbon atoms. However, DNA adducts and hemoglobin adducts decreased with increasing number of carbon atoms with the most pronounced decrease being from C2 to C3. The decrease in hemoglobin adducts was more pronounced than DNA adducts. All 1-alkenes caused formation of detectable levels of hemoglobin and DNA adducts, although the levels of hemoglobin adducts after C4-C8 exposure were low. These results also indicate that extrapolation within the homologous series is possible. /1-Alkenes/",

In everyday use, the IUPAC nomenclature is less common than the use of older designations. Especially the branched-chain isomer 4 is commonly referred to as \"isobutene\" or \"isobutylene\" instead of the IUPAC name \"2-methylpropene\". The three linear chain isomers 1, 2, and 3 are usually referred to as \"n-butenes\" and often occur as mixtures during chemical processing. The old name \"butylenes\" is still in use for butenes.",

There are three types of TLVs for chemicals. [1] Threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA): average exposure on the basis of a 8h/day, 40h/week work schedule. [2] Threshold limit value - short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL): a 15-minute TWA exposure that should not be exceeded at any time during a workday, even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV-TWA. [3] Threshold limit value - ceiling limit (TLV-C): absolute exposure limit that should not be exceeded at any time. TLVs are developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist.  While TLVs are widely accepted occupational exposure limits, they are not standards enforced by the U.S. Government.",

CAUTION: Hydrogen (UN1049), Deuterium (UN1957), Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid (UN1966) and Methane (UN1971) are lighter than air and will rise.  Hydrogen and Deuterium fires are difficult to detect since they burn with an invisible flame. Use an alternate method of detection (thermal camera, broom handle, etc.) Vapors may travel to source of ignition and flash back. Cylinders exposed to fire may vent and release flammable gas through pressure relief devices. Containers may explode when heated. Ruptured cylinders may rocket. /Butylene/",

It is is used for the production of a wide variety of chemicals in the gasoline and rubber processing areas. Most 1-butene is used as a comonomer for linear low-density polyethylene, which contains up to 10%. However, 1-butene is also used as a comonomer for modifying high-density polyethylene, which contains up to 4%. HUMAN STUDIES: 1-Butene is a simple asphyxiant and may be a CNS depressant in high concentrations. It has a low acute toxicity and is mildly irritating to the eye. On direct eye and skin contact liquid butene can cause burns and frostbite. The treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60) for 24 hr resulted in an increase of DNA damage. HL60 cells were more resistant than PBMCs to the DNA damage. ANIMAL STUDIES: Exposure to 1-butene at target concentrations of 500, 2000, 8000 ppm (approximately 1147, 4589, 18359 mg/cu m) did not induce systemic toxicity in male and female rats exposed for 28 days or in pregnant female rats exposed for 14 days pre-mating, through mating and gestation to day 19. There were no treatment-related effects on the development of pups. As an anesthetic, it is 4.5 times more potent than ethylene. Exposure of mice to concentrations of 15% butene resulted in reversible signs of incoordination, confusion, and hyperexcitability; at 20% deep anesthesia in 8 to 15 min, with subsequent respiratory failure in 2 hr; and at 30% in 2 to 4 min and 40 min, respectively. A concentration of 40% resulted in profound anesthesia in 30 sec, with no CNS symptoms but with death in 10 to 15 min. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Tomato: epinasty in petiole: 50,000 ppm, 2 days.",

Because of their high reactivity some epoxides are also produced in the chemical industry for the synthesis of other compounds. Therefore, human exposure to VOCs epoxides does occur and may be an important human health concern. In this study, the in vitro genotoxic potential of epoxides originating from 1,3-butadiene (3,4-epoxy-1-butene: EB; 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane: DEB), isoprene (3,4-epoxy-2-methyl-1-butene: IO), styrene (styrene-7,8-oxide: SO), propylene (propylene oxide: PO) and 1-butene (1,2-epoxy-butane: BO) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60) was measured with the comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis, SCGE). The effect of inclusion of fetal calf serum (FCS, 5%) in the cell-culture medium and different durations of exposure (2 hr, 24 hr) were also investigated. All epoxides tested produced DNA damage in a concentration range that did not reduce cell viability. HL60 cells were more resistant than PBMCs to the DNA damage induced by the different epoxides. With the exception of IO, the treatment for 24 hr resulted in an increase of DNA damage. FCS slightly protected PBMCs from the genotoxic effects induced by IO and BO, whilst no such effect was noted for the other compounds. Overall, the dose-dependent effects that were seen allowed us to define a genotoxicity scale for the different epoxides as follows: SO>EB>DEB>IO>PO>BO, which is in partial agreement with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification of the carcinogenic hazards.",

If released to air, a vapor pressure of 2250 mm Hg at 25 \u00b0C indicates 1-butene will exist solely as a gas in the atmosphere. Gas-phase 1-butene is expected to be rapidly oxidized by both photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals and ozone. The half-life for these processes are 12 and 22 hrs, respectively. Night-time degradation by the reaction with nitrate radicals is not expected to be a significant removal process. 1-Butene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight. If released to soil, 1-butene is expected to have high mobility based upon an estimated Koc of 120. Volatilization from moist soil surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon a Henry's Law constant of 2.33X10-1 atm-cu m/mole. 1-Butene may volatilize from dry soil surfaces based upon its vapor pressure. Utilizing the Japanese MITI test, 3% of the Theoretical BOD was reached in 4 weeks indicating that biodegradation is not an important environmental fate process  in soil or water. However, alkenes can be utilized by a wide range of microorganisms and are catabolized via several routes, resulting in the unsaturated alcohol, aldehyde and fatty acid or the formation of epoxide, diol compounds and possibly hydroxyacids. If released into water, 1-butene is not expected to adsorb to suspended solids and sediment based upon the estimated Koc. Volatilization from water surfaces is expected to be an important fate process based upon this compound's Henry's Law constant. Estimated volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 2 hours and 3 days, respectively. An estimated BCF of 18 suggests the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low. Hydrolysis is not expected to be an important environmental fate process since this compound lacks functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions (pH 5 to 9). Occupational exposure to 1-butene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-butene is produced or used. In particular, workers in the petroleum field are likely to be exposed to 1-butene by inhalation of gasoline fumes during the production, transport or dispensing of motor fuels. Due to its high volatility and occurrence in combustion fuels and automobile exhaust, the most likely pathway by which the general public may be exposed to 1-butene is via inhalation of ambient air and inhalation during the use of gasoline products containing 1-butene. Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-butene via ingestion of some food oils, although this pathway is considered minor when compared to inhalation. Exposure may also occur from smoking cigaretttes. (SRC)",

Gas-phase 1-butene is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically-produced hydroxyl radicals(SRC); the half-life for this reaction in air is estimated to be 12 hours(SRC), calculated from its rate constant of 3.14X10-11 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(3). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 1-butene with ozone has been estimated as 1.2X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(4). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 23 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(5). Products from this reaction are formic and propionic acid(6). Based on a half-life of 149 hours, from and average rate constant of 5.4X10-15 cu cm/molec-sec(7,8), night-time degradation by the reaction with nitrate radicals is not expected to be a significant removal process. 1-Butene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(9) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 12 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 5X10+5 hydroxyl radicals per cu cm(SRC). The rate constant for the vapor-phase reaction of 1-butene with ozone has been estimated as 1.2X10-17 cu cm/molecule-sec at 25 \u00b0C(SRC) that was derived using a structure estimation method(2). This corresponds to an atmospheric half-life of about 23 hours at an atmospheric concentration of 7X10+11 ozone molecules per cu cm(3). Products from this reaction are formic and propionic acid(4). Rate constants for the gas-phase reaction of 1-butene with nitrate radicals in the range 1.1X10-14 to 9.7X10-15 cu cm/molec-sec at room temperature have appeared in the literature(5,6). Using an average value of 5.4X10-15 cu cm/molec-sec(6) and a nitrate radical concentration of 2.4X10+8 molec/cu cm(7), a half-life of 149 hours can be calculated(SRC), indicating that this process will not be an important night-time removal mechanism. Products from this reaction include propionaldehyde, ethyloxirane and 1-nitroxy-2-butanone(8). The rate constant for the estimated OH radical reaction of 1-butene with hydroxyl radicals in aqueous solutions is 7.0X10+9 L/mol-sec(9); this corresponds to an aquatic half-life of 115 days at an aquatic concentration of 1X10-17 hydroxyl radicals per liter(10). 1-Butene is not expected to undergo hydrolysis in the environment due to the lack of functional groups that hydrolyze under environmental conditions(11). 1-Butene does not contain chromophores that absorb at wavelengths >290 nm(11) and, therefore, is not expected to be susceptible to direct photolysis by sunlight(SRC).",

The soil/water adsorption coefficient, also known as solid-water distribution coefficient (Kd), measures the amount of chemical substance adsorbed onto soil per amount of water.  Since adsorption occurs predominantly by partition into the soil organic matter, it is more useful to normalize the Kd value to the organic carbon content of a soil and express the distribution coefficient in Koc (organic carbon normalized distribution coefficient).  The greater the Kd (or Koc) value, the less likely a chemical will leach or contribute to runoff.  A very high value means it is strongly adsorbed onto soil and organic matter and does not move throughout the soil.",

Air samples were also collected within Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport on August 27, 1990(2). 1-Butene and isobutylene were found to be 0.41 ppbC% of total non-methane organic compounds(2). The estimated total yearly emission for 1-butene in Belgium was 423 tons/yr in 1991(3). 1-Butene was detected from 1979-80 in urban air samples taken from Australia at 1.0 ppb(4). On August 28, 1987, the average concentration of 1-butene in the atmosphere from eight sites in the Los Angeles Air Basin was 2.56 ug/cu m(5). Average ambient concentration of 1-butene in the city of Porto Alegre, Brazil from March 20, 1996-April 16, 1997 was 3.8 mg/cu m(6). In August 1995, measurements of various non-methane hydrocarbons were studied within the Vancouver's Cassiar Connector highway tunnel(7). The average mass fraction of 1-butene/isobutene detected in the tunnel was 0.031(8). The median concentration of 1-butene measured between 6 and 9 am during the summers of 1984-86 in 39 U.S. cities located between 26 deg N and 43 deg N latitude was 2.95 ppb(8). In a study to acquire a baseline concentration of volatile organic compounds found in urban air samples considered as non-industrial areas, 1-butene/isobutene was detected 76.79% of the time at a mean concentration of 0.67 ppbv from March 12, 1990 to March 11, 1991(9). In a study of light-duty vehicle emissions in the Caldecott Tunnel in San Francisco, 1-butene was detected in August and October 1994 at 0.48 and 0.43% by weight of total volatile organic compounds, respectively(10). 1-Butene/isobutene were detected in Vienna, Austria in May, 1987, Sydney, Australia from September 1979-June 1980, and in Washington D.C., U.S.A from July-August 1980 at 10.1, 9.6, and 4 ppb, respectively(11). 1-Butene was detected, average emission factor of 113.9 mg/kg, in the Maria Maluf road tunnel, located in Brazil, monitored from May 4-6, 2004(12).",

The estimated annual emissions of 1-butene from gasoline powered  vehicles in the UK, 1983, is 2.19 kt(2). The hydrocarbon content emitted from a two-stroke moped engine for an alkylate-based fuel and a conventional reformate-based fuel was studied(3). When the moped was operated at 30 km/hr on alkylate fuel, 1-butene was detected in the exhaust as 0.20% by weight of total non-methane hydrocarbons and when the moped used conventional reformate-based fuel, 1-butene was detected in the exhaust as 0.22% by weight of total non-methane hydrocarbons(3). Initially, the alkylate fuel did not contain 1-butene while the reformate-based fuel contained 1-butene as 0.03% of total non-methane hydrocarbons(3). Emissions from nine late-model motor vehicles with four-cylinder engines were characterized at three test temperatures to simulate summer driving(4). The vehicles were tested at temperatures of 75, 90, and 105 \u00b0F with unleaded gasoline(4). 1-Butene was detected at 0.46, 0.51, and 0.54% by weight of hydrocarbon emissions from throttle body injection vehicles at 75, 90, and 105 \u00b0F, respectively(4). Comparatively, 1-butene was detected at 0.46, 0.50, and 0.46% by weight of hydrocarbon emissions from port fuel injection vehicles at 75, 90, and 105 \u00b0F, respectively(4). 1-Butene has been detected, but not quantified, in diesel exhaust(5). A 1999 air quality study in Cairo, Egypt found 1-butene in a median concentration of 1.85 and 1.59 in an unspecified number of roadway and motorcycle emission air samples(6).",

In winter 1986-87, the average concentration of 1-butene collected at two sites, in Boise, ID, was 1.7 ppbC(2). In 1977, 1-butene was detected at concentrations ranging from 5.0-5.5 ug/cu-m at the top of an 82-story building at noon in New York City(3). In summer 1977, the maximum concentration of 1-butene measured in 780 samples from Houston, TX, was 45 ppbC(4). In July 1973, the concentration of 1-butene in downtown Houston obtained during two day-long sampling expeditions ranged from not detected to 0.01 ppm and from not detected to 0.022 ppm in three sampling expeditions in Pasadena, TX(5). In 1965-66, the concentration of 1-butene in two rooftop samples taken in Riverside, CA, were 6.4 and 2.0 ppb, respectively(6). The percent of 1-butene measured at 6 sites along Highway 70 in Raleigh, NC, May 1983, ranged from 0.25-0.67% of the total non-methane hydrocarbons(7). On January 29, 1997, 1-butene was detected at estimated concentrations ranging from 0.1-2.1 ppbv (average = 0.9 ppbv) in air samples collected over a 1-hour period in Taipei, Taiwan(8).",

At 100 m downwind of a fluid catalytic unit in Sweden, 1-butene was detected ranging from 1.1-2.0% by weight of all C2-C8 hydrocarbons released in 1992(1). Six service stations, two in Cincinnati, Ohio, two in Phoenix, Arizona and two in Los Angeles, California, were studied to determine the exposure level of various volatile organic compounds released during self-serve fill-up operations from October-November, 1990(2). During this investigation, 1-butene was detected ranging from 0.04-2.3 mg/cu m and 0.04-5.1 mg/cu m from the two Cincinnati, Ohio service stations(2). From two Phoenix, Arizona service stations, 1-butene was detected ranging from 0.04-2.7 and 0.04-0.7 mg/cu m(2). Finally, 1-butene was detected ranging from 0.04-2.7 and 0.04-2.2 mg/cu m from the two service stations in Los Angeles, California(2). The concentration of 1-butene downwind of a chemical manufacturing plant in North Cheshire, England, 1978, ranged from <1-24 ppb (10 sites), downwind of a refinery <1-13 ppb (5 sites), a fertilizer plant 14 ppb (1 site), and in background areas: populated 1-21 ppb (5 sites) and rural <1-12 ppb (22 sites)(3).",

Occupational exposure to 1-butene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact with this compound at workplaces where 1-butene is produced or used. In particular, workers in the petroleum field are likely to be exposed to 1-butene by inhalation of gasoline fumes during the production, transport or dispensing of motor fuels(2,3). Due to its high volatility and occurrence in combustion fuels and automobile exhaust, the most likely pathway by which the general public may be exposed to 1-butene is via inhalation of ambient air(4,5) and inhalation during the use of gasoline products containing 1-butene(6). Monitoring data also indicate that the general population may be exposed to 1-butene via ingestion of some food oils, although this pathway is considered minor when compared to inhalation. Exposure may also occur from smoking cigaretttes(SRC).",

The ontology has been mapped to several collections of chemicals, including (a) Chemicals of Biological Interest (ChEBI), (b) the ChEMBL database of bioactive molecules, (c) the LOTUS natural product collection, (d) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) extracted from Barnabas et al (2022) DOI: 10.1039/D2DD00019A (e) PubChemLite and (f) the ZeroPM Global Chemical Inventory.",
